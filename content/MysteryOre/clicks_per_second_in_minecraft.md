Clicks per second (CPS) is a critical skill in [[minecraft_18_pvp_skills | Minecraft PVP]], especially in version 1.8. This article delves into the importance of CPS, techniques for improvement, and the results of a week-long training dedicated to mastering this essential skill.

## Importance of CPS in Minecraft 1.8

Before the combat update, CPS was a major factor in player versus player (PVP) combat. A higher CPS often resulted in a significant advantage during fights by allowing faster attack rates and effectively outmaneuvering opponents [[minecraft_combat_systems_pre_versus_post_19 | combat systems pre versus post 1.9]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a>]. However, high CPS isn't everything; it must be balanced with accuracy and strategic play to be truly effective.

## Training Regimen

The video outlines a comprehensive training plan aimed at improving CPS alongside other crucial skills. The CPS training consists of:

- **Short Bursts:** Three 10-second CPS sprints.
- **Mid-Distance:** Three 30-second CPS mid-distance races.
- **Endurance:** Three 60-second CPS long-distance races.

The goals were to improve burst speed and gain endurance for sustained clicking [[aim_training_for_minecraft | aim training]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">00:01:41</a>].

## Baseline and Improvements

On the first day, the baseline CPS was recorded at 5 clicks per second (CPS). The initial attempts were described humorously as "terrible," emphasizing the challenge ahead [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">00:02:58</a>]. By the end of the week, the CPS increased to 6.3, marking a 26% improvement [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">00:05:14</a>].

## Challenges and Observations

The video creator noted that despite initial struggles, gradual improvements were evident through persistent training [[navigating_challenges_and_overcoming_obstacles_in_minecraft | overcoming obstacles]]. There were moments of mental fatigue where it felt as if the technique was being forgotten, underlining the physical and mental strain of intense CPS training [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">00:05:02</a>]. 

### Use of Supplements

Importantly, the video humorously debunks the use of performance-enhancing supplements to achieve better results, reinforcing that the improvement was due solely to dedication and effort [[achieving_game_objectives_under_unique_constraints | achieving objectives under constraints]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">00:05:10</a>].

## Conclusion

The week-long focus on CPS significantly transformed the player's performance, making gameplay more natural and less effort-intensive [[surviving_and_thriving_in_minecraft_hardcore_mode | thriving in Hardcore mode]] [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">00:09:59</a>]. Despite not continuing the intense training regimen, the core takeaway was how focused practice can yield substantial improvements in specific gaming skills.

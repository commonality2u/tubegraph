## Introduction
Javier Milei, the president of Argentina, rose to prominence with his libertarian and anarcho-capitalist views, promising a dramatic overhaul of Argentina's economic landscape with a commitment to [combating government corruption in Argentina | combating corruption] and promoting economic freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This article examines the economic reforms initiated under his leadership and their impact on the country's economic stability and growth.

## The Economic Situation Pre-Reforms
When Javier Milei assumed office, Argentina was on the brink of hyperinflation, deep in debt, and suffering from mass unemployment and poverty. The country's fiscal deficit was 15% of GDP, with inflation rates skyrocketing as high as 177,000% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>. The Central Bank bore negative net currency reserves and substantial foreign debts, presenting a dire economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:02]</a>.

## Key Reforms Implemented

### Reduction of Bureaucracy
Milei's campaign symbolized by a chainsaw promised to reduce the size of the governmental bureaucracy drastically. He fulfilled this by slashing the number of ministries from more than half of the original count to just nine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>. Approximately 50,000 civil servants were dismissed as part of efforts to cut government expenses and increase efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

### Fiscal Adjustments
Milei secured Argentina's first fiscal surplus in 16 years by eliminating discretionary spending, stopping public works, and restoring utility prices to cut economic subsidies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This was achieved by implementing a tremendous fiscal adjustment, successfully avoiding the hyperinflation that had threatened the nation's economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>.

### Deregulation
A concerted effort was made to deregulate the economy. Argentina's deregulation ministry, dismantled many existing regulations and streamlined processes, significantly enhancing economic freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:23">[01:12:23]</a>. Milei's government introduced 3,200 additional structural reforms that were still pending, aiming to make Argentina the freest economy globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

### Legislative Achievements
Milei oversaw legislation such as the single paper ballot, making elections more transparent and cost-effective, ending the use of large and expensive ballots that had been used to manipulate votes in favor of the ruling party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[00:37:02]</a>.

### Advancement towards Economic Freedom
The successful implementation of free market principles set Argentina on a path to sustained economic growth similar to Ireland's earlier free market reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:46">[00:26:46]</a>.

## Economic Impact and Recognition
The rapid economic transformation led to international recognition, with entities such as JP Morgan adjusting Argentina's growth projections upward. Argentina's per capita GDP is expected to multiply 2.5 times, representing significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:31">[01:33:31]</a>. Thanks to these reforms, real wages increased, poverty rates were reduced, and Argentina's GDP grew beyond the starting point of Milei's administration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:30">[01:33:30]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms
Despite these reforms, Milei faced criticism from those fearful of the short-term socioeconomic pain resulting from his drastic reforms. However, his steadfast approach to advancing libertarian values in economic policy has consolidated reforms foundational for long-term stability and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Conclusion
Under Javier Milei, Argentina embarked on one of the most ambitious economic reform agendas in modern history. By drastically reducing bureaucratic bloat, implementing wholesale fiscal adjustments, deregulating the economy, and striving towards making Argentina one of the freest economies in the world, Milei is fundamentally reshaping the economic landscape of the nation, aligning it closer to the principles of [[economic_policies_and_abundance_agenda | free market capitalism]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.

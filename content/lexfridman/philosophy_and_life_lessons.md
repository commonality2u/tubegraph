Philosophy often acts as a guiding light, illuminating the complex corridors of life with insights and perspectives that can transform one's understanding of existence. In a compelling conversation with RZA, a renowned rapper, philosopher, and mastermind behind the legendary hip-hop group Wu-Tang Clan, profound reflections on life, mortality, and the essence of being were explored. Here, we delve into the philosophical insights and life lessons shared by RZA, which resonate deeply across the spheres of creativity, personal growth, and existential understanding.

## The Umbilical Connection to the Universe

In the **Tao of Wu**, RZA writes about the profound loss experienced upon the death of his mother, describing it as losing a main link to the universe. He elaborates on the concept of an etheric cord that connects individuals to their mothers and all souls. When this connection is severed through death, a part of the individual undergoes a transformation that touches upon both the physical and the mental realms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Mortality Versus Immortality

The passing of his mother brought a significant realization about his own mortality versus the immortality of the soul. RZA shares how this realization brought him joy and a newfound appreciation for life, free from the illusions of physical immortality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This reflection aligns with themes discussed in [[philosophy_of_mortality_and_meaning_of_life]], where the acceptance of one's finite existence can lead to a more profound engagement with life.

## God and Perfection

RZA reflects on his youthful arrogance and the concept of being a "scientist" or a "god" among men. He recounts questioning the literal interpretation of being a god, especially when facing the inability to save his dying mother. This humbling experience reshaped his understanding of the divine, suggesting that being god-like is about embodying wisdom, strength, and beauty, rather than possessing the power over life and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Legacy and Remembrance

The desire for his mother's name to be honored and remembered by his family highlights the importance of legacy—a theme prevalent in philosophical discussions about life and death. Naming a school in his movie after his mother is one way RZA attempts to preserve her memory in the physical realm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Fear of Death

RZA admits to not fearing death but is cautious of its arrival, embracing life as his primary focus. His commentary on death echoes the teachings of Bodhidharma, a great teacher who confessed to not knowing what happens after death, emphasizing uncertainty as part of the human condition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>. This aligns with discussions in [[philosophy_and_mortality]], where the contemplation of mortality can enrich life without necessitating fear.

## Philosophy in Art and Life

Throughout his conversation, RZA touches on the philosophical underpinnings in art, particularly in kung fu movies. He sees these films as rich in wisdom, offering lessons in adaptability and embodying the traits of the five animal techniques, which can translate into life skills beyond mere physical combat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>. This synthesis of philosophy and art reflects discussions in [[philosophy_and_lessons_in_programming_and_entrepreneurship]], where artistic expression is not just an end but a means of exploring deeper truths.

## Conclusion

RZA's reflections encapsulate a philosophical journey through life, colored by profound personal experiences and artistic endeavors. His story underscores the interplay between mortality, art, and the legacy we leave behind—a common thread in philosophical discourse that encourages a deeper appreciation for the transient and beautiful nature of life itself. Whether through music, film, or personal reflections, the philosophy of life, as RZA demonstrates, is an ongoing dialogue with the self, framed by experiences and enriched by the wisdom passed down through generations.

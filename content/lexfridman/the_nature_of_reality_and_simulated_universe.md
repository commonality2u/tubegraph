## Overview

The concept of a [[simulation_theory_and_the_potential_of_living_in_a_simulation | simulated universe]] and the nature of reality are topics that have intrigued philosophers, scientists, and thinkers for centuries. Yoshi Bach, a distinguished researcher in artificial intelligence, engages deeply with these subjects, exploring the philosophical underpinnings and implications of a potentially simulated existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Understanding Reality

### Dualism, Idealism, and Materialism

In Western philosophy, dualism has been a prevalent notion, suggesting the existence of two fundamental substances: the mental and the physical. The mental realm is seen as distinct and interacts with the physical world, which is understood through the lens of mechanistic causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:56">[00:31:56]</a>.

> Dualism posits a separation between the mental and physical realms. However, Bach views them as intertwined facets of a larger whole, suggesting that the mental realm's "realness" is rooted in subjective consciousness rather than an objective physical existence.

### The Physical Universe as a Quantum Graph

Bach describes our perceived reality as a virtual simulation generated by the brain, constrained by the patterns on our retinas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. This denotes a lack of direct access to the "quantum graph," the substrate underpinning all existence, akin to the laden Mandelbrot fractalâ€”complex, recursive, and self-replicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:32">[00:40:32]</a>.

## Simulated Consciousness

### Consciousness as a Simulation

According to Bach, [[consciousness_and_reality | consciousness]] is inherently a simulated property of the mind, framed through a narrative constructed within the brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>. This phenomenon challenges the notion that consciousness could be an exclusive product of biological processes, reframing it instead as a mathematical simulation.

> The emergence of consciousness, as Bach suggests, relies on a recursive loop of attention and self-reference, allowing a virtual system to perceive itself as conscious.

### The Role of Imagination and Models

Intelligence, as per Bach, is the capacity to model reality and identify patterns. This ability extends to hypothesizing the universe as a complex simulation. The metaphoric "Tractatus," which lacks typical academic references, proposes models merging philosophical insight with universal logical structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:08">[00:17:08]</a>.

## Reality Construction: Probabilities and Possibilities

### Models and Constraints

In constructing reality, minds rely on creating sparse models, only constrained by the possible states they can engage with. Dreaming and imaginative processes represent a continuous negotiation between perceptions and probable realities, refining our understanding and interaction with the experiential universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:43">[00:59:43]</a>.

## Implications of a Simulated Existence

Bach reflects on the existential implications of a [[simulation_theory_and_universe_as_computation | simulated universe]], positing that our reality could be akin to a complex computer game, an intricate level built upon historical and existential understanding, much like a computer game metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:48">[02:59:48]</a>.

### The Question of Objective Truth

The pursuit of objective truth, according to Bach, demands an understanding of the frameworks that define truth within our [[quantum_mechanics_and_the_nature_of_reality | quantum existence]]. This leads to an ontological exploration of truth through the lens of computation and representation.

## Conclusion

The exploration of reality as a simulated construct prompts significant philosophical inquiry, bridging gaps between ancient wisdom and contemporary scientific thought. The dialogue initiated by thinkers like Yoshi Bach continues to challenge and expand our perception of existence, leading us deeper into the fractal complexities of consciousness and reality.

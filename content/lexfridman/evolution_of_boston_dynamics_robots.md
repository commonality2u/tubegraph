The journey of Boston Dynamics is a fascinating saga of technological innovation and perseverance in robotics. Under the leadership of Marc Raibert, the company has been at the forefront of creating some of the most advanced legged robots in the world, starting from the early prototypes to the current sophisticated machines.

## Early Beginnings and the Birth of BigDog

Boston Dynamics’ robotic saga began with the development of BigDog, a quadruped robot designed for military use by DARPA. The BigDog project emerged from Raibert’s earlier work at Carnegie Mellon University (CMU) and MIT's Leg Lab, where he had developed a strong foundation in [[humanoid_robots_and_legged_robotics_challenges | legged locomotion]] through projects like the quadruped with external power supplies and sophisticated balance controls. BigDog, however, was the first fully autonomous machine designed to operate in rugged terrains, featuring an onboard gasoline engine for power and hydraulic actuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

### Advancing to LS3 and Spot

BigDog eventually evolved into the LS3 (Legged Squad Support System), which could carry a heavier load, up to 1,000 pounds, and travel autonomously over long distances thanks to its gasoline-powered engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:03">[00:35:03]</a>. This iteration demonstrated not only improved physical capabilities but also an increased efficiency in deployment within military applications.

Following the LS3, Boston Dynamics shifted focus towards more compact and efficient robots, leading to the development of Spot. Unlike its predecessors, Spot is fully electric, a response to the idea of creating a quieter and more accessible robot that could operate within human environments without being intimidating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>.

## The Role of Hydraulic vs. Electric Systems

Throughout Boston Dynamics’ journey, there’s been a constant evolution from hydraulic systems in early robots like BigDog and LS3 to electric systems in Spot. The transition from hydraulic to electric has been integral in making robots more lightweight and adaptable to different environments without the "icky" drawbacks associated with hydraulic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

## Influences and Approach

Marc Raibert’s approach has been characterized by a distinctive combination of athletic intelligence involving mechanical design, real-time control, and innovative control systems that mimic the dynamic locomotion of living creatures. This innovation in hardware has significantly contributed to the naturalistic movement and agility of Boston Dynamics robots, setting them apart in the field of [[dynamics_and_control_in_robotics | dynamics and control in robotics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

## Future Directions

The establishment of the Boston Dynamics AI Institute marks another chapter in the company's evolution, focusing on combining athletic and cognitive intelligence to create future generations of robots that are even more autonomous and capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. With ongoing projects emphasizing machine learning and cognitive skills, Boston Dynamics aims to broaden the functional applications of its robots beyond their current constraints, pushing the boundaries of what humanoid and legged robots can achieve in various sectors.

> A popular misconception is that BigDog and its successors operated autonomously right from the start. In reality, these robots initially required significant human intervention for navigation and control, as demonstrated by early iterations that heavily relied on human operators for visual perception and movement coordination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>.

Boston Dynamics continues to be a beacon of innovation in robotics, drawing from an illustrious history of dynamic research and practical application, paving the way for the robots of the future.

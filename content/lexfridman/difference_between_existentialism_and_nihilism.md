Existentialism and nihilism are two philosophical concepts that address different aspects of human existence, meaning, and morality. Although closely related, they propose diverging viewpoints on the purpose and significance of life.

## Existentialism

Existentialism is primarily a philosophical movement that emerged in the mid-20th century and is largely associated with figures such as Jean-Paul Sartre, Albert Camus, Simone de Beauvoir, and Martin Heidegger. Existentialism asserts that life has no inherent meaning, and it is up to individuals to create their own significance and values through their choices and actions. A key phrase in existentialism is that "existence precedes essence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This means that humans first exist and then define their essence through living, decisions, and accepting the responsibility for those decisions.

According to Sartre, individuals are "condemned to be free" and must take full responsibility for their actions without relying on external authorities, such as divine beings or rigid moral codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Existentialism can be perceived as empowering and terrifying simultaneously, as it places the burden and the freedom of meaning-making squarely on human shoulders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It delves into questions of freedom, isolation, and the search for meaning in a seemingly indifferent universe.

## Nihilism

Nihilism, a term popularized by Friedrich Nietzsche, presents a more pessimistic outlook. Nietzsche identified nihilism as a condition of the modern world, indicating a loss of faith in religious and metaphysical narratives that traditionally provided meaning. According to Nietzsche, the proclamation "God is dead" captures the removal of divine purpose and the subsequent struggle to find meaning in a godless world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Nihilism posits that life inherently lacks purpose, higher value, and significance. This outlook can result in a sense of despair and purposelessness as individuals confront the "nothing" or "knee hill" that nihilism describes as the basis of existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:53">[00:22:53]</a>.

## Comparison and Interconnections

Existentialism and nihilism share the recognition of a universe indifferent to human struggles. However, they diverge in their approach to this reality:

1. **Existential Creation of Meaning**: Existentialism encourages individuals to create their own meaning and values through active choice and responsibility, despite the absence of inherent purpose.
   
2. **Nihilistic Despair**: Nihilism often stops at the recognition of meaninglessness without offering a proactive solution, potentially leading to despair.

3. **Existential Critique of Nihilism**: Existentialism critiques nihilism by proposing action and engagement with lifeâ€”creating one's essence as opposed to succumbing to the void.

## Existentialism vs. Nihilism: Addressing Mattering

In existentialism, Sartre suggests that criticism of oneself or others can arise from failing to take responsibility for one's choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. In contrast, nihilism struggles with the question of whether decisions matter at all if life is inherently meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Nietzsche and Sartre offer different resolutions to the challenge posed by nihilism. While [[existentialism_and_its_evolution | Sartre]] proposes radical freedom and personal responsibility, Nietzsche encourages living as "artists of life," embracing creativity in the face of meaninglessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

In sum, existentialism and nihilism present distinct philosophical responses to the human condition, with existentialism advocating for the active creation of self-defined purpose and nihilism reflecting the struggle with perceived insignificance. Despite their differences, both philosophies grapple with profound questions of existence, freedom, and responsibility.

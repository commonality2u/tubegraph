Existential risks are scenarios that could lead to human extinction or permanently and drastically curtail humanity's potential. These risks pose significant challenges to our society due to their high stakes and the uncertainty surrounding them. Addressing [[existential risks and future of humanity | existential risks]] requires both foresight and careful management.

## Understanding Existential Risk

Existential risks are distinct because they threaten the entire future of humanity, without offering the chance to recover and learn from mistakes after they occur. As highlighted by Nick Bostrom, "[o]ur existential risks cannot be one of trial-and-error. Thereâ€™s no opportunity to learn from errors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:01">[01:56:01]</a>. This underscores the necessity for proactive rather than reactive approaches in managing such risks.

## Categories of Existential Risks

Existential risks can be broadly divided into several categories:

1. **Natural Risks**: These include risks like asteroid impacts or supervolcanic eruptions, which have affected Earth in the past.
2. **Anthropogenic Risks**: These are risks resulting from human activities such as nuclear war, climate change, or engineered pandemics.
3. **Technological Risks**: As technology evolves, new risks emerge. These include [[existential_risks_nuclear_ai_and_biological_threats | superintelligent AI]] and various [[ai_alignment_and_existential_risks | AI alignment challenges]].

## Simulation Hypothesis & Existential Risk

Nick Bostrom's [[existential_risks_posed_by_superintelligent_ai | simulation argument]] presents an intriguing intersection between existential risk and philosophical inquiry. Bostrom argues that if civilizations can create simulations of conscious entities, those simulated beings would vastly outnumber real ones. Consequently, there's a significant probability that we might be such simulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## Global Coordination in Risk Management

Effective management of existential risks requires global coordination. The complexities involved in addressing these risks often extend beyond national borders, necessitating international collaboration and shared strategies. Concepts such as [[existential_risks_and_global_coordination | global coordination]] are crucial to mitigate these risks effectively.

## Moving Forward

Through understanding and addressing existential risks, humanity has the potential to secure its future. This involves a commitment to research and the development of technologies and policies that can anticipate and prevent catastrophic outcomes. Just as Bostrom advocates, "[w]e must take a proactive approach... to anticipate new types of threats and a willingness to take decisive preventive action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:12">[01:56:12]</a>.

By taking existential risks seriously and investing in both understanding and prevention, we can foster a future where humanity can thrive without the shadow of potential self-destruction looming over us.

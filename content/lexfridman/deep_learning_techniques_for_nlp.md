Natural language processing (NLP) exists at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, with the objective of enabling computers to process or understand natural language in ways that are useful for people, such as **question answering** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, deep understanding of language remains an elusive goal due to the complexity of representing and using linguistic, situational, world, and visual knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

## What Makes NLP Difficult?

The challenges in NLP arise from the complexity inherent in language, such as representational ambiguities and the need for world knowledge to disambiguate meanings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Moreover, some tasks in NLP, like perfect language understanding, are considered as AI-complete problems, implying they require solving complex AI-related tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Advances through Deep Learning

### **Key Representation Methods:**

1. **Word Vectors and Embeddings:** Early methods involved discrete representations like taxonomies and synonym sets, which fell short in capturing language nuances and transitioned to distributional similarities. Models like **word2vec** and **GloVe** improved the quantitative analysis of corset relations between words, allowing models to better understand semantics through word vectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

2. **Sequence Models:** Sequence models, particularly recurrent neural networks (RNNs), and evolving towards more sophisticated versions such as **Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs)**, allow handling input sequences more effectively. These models enable the processing of words in their context, enhancing tasks like machine translation and sentiment analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

### **Application Facets:**

Deep learning has markedly improved tasks like:

- **Speech Recognition and Syntax-Semantics Understanding:** Bypassing the need for detailed morphological analysis, deep learning models execute semantic tasks directly, without needing full syntactic analysis<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

- **Question Answering and Machine Translation:** These areas exemplify where semantic understanding is vital, and where deep learning has shown considerable promise, despite not matching human accuracy fully yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Recent Developments: Dynamic Approaches

**Dynamic Memory Networks (DMNs):** One key innovation in deep NLP is the development of DMNs, which conceptualize complex question answering as an iterative attention-driven cognitive process. They use RNNs for episodic memory, allowing for reasoning over multiple text 'episodes' to derive answers based on contextually relevant facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

### **Deep Learning Challenges and Future Directions:**

In advancing deep learning for NLP, one major goal is developing models that take inspiration from human question-answering logic, whereby multiple NLP tasks are framed as such and tackled with the same kinds of models. Challenges remain in achieving this with only the kind of semantic knowledge typical of human reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

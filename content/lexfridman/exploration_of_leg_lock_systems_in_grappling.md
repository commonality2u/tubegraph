In the intricate world of grappling, **leg locks** have emerged as a highly effective technique, evolving significantly over recent decades. The leg lock system is not merely a set of isolated submissions but an intricate weave of control mechanisms and risk management strategies.

## Historical Context

Historically, leg locks were often regarded with skepticism within the [[jiu_jitsu_and_submission_grappling | Jiu Jitsu]] community, seen as low-percentage techniques that posed significant risks of injury and loss of positional control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:51">[01:44:51]</a>. This perspective started shifting significantly when practitioners began to view leg locks not only in terms of their ability to finish a match but also as a strategic cornerstone that fundamentally changes how grapplers approach both offense and defense.

## Control vs. Breaking

A pivotal realization in the development of effective leg lock systems is distinguishing the mechanism of control from the mechanism of breaking. As John Danaher, a preeminent coach in the grappling community, described, the foundational principle in a successful leg lock system is control through entanglement, commonly referred to as "ashi garami," which literally translates to "leg entanglement" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

- **Control:** The priority is to utilize ashi garami to positionally dominate the opponent's lower body, wrapping one's legs around the opponent's to immobilize and control their movement.
- **Breaking:** The breaking mechanism, such as the heel hook, comes second. It is the tool for submission, but without effective control, the breaking attempt can lead to losing positional advantage.

## Evolution of Leg Lock Techniques

### Positional Advantage

One key development advocated by Danaher and his students is attacking leg locks from bottom positions, thereby negating the traditional risk of losing positional dominance seen when leg locks are attacked from the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:51">[01:53:51]</a>.

### Safety and Efficacy

By focusing heavily on controlling the opponent through elaborate entanglement setups, Danaher's approach allows practitioners to safely apply leg locks without resorting to brute force or excessive speed, reducing the risk of injury to their training partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:32">[01:52:32]</a>.

### Transitioning and Countering

Advanced systems involve transitioning between different ashi garami positions (such as 50-50 guard and inside sankaku) to adapt to opponentsâ€™ defensive maneuvers, hence maintaining control and maximizing submission opportunities.

## Training Methodologies

The success of the modern leg lock system is also attributed to rigorous and methodical [[training_methodologies_and_strategies_in_jiu_jitsu | training strategies]]. By leveraging effective heuristic rules rather than relying merely on raw computational power, grapplers can intuitively navigate complex scenarios and adjust their techniques dynamically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>.

## Influences and Broader Impact

The success of practitioners like Gordon Ryan and members of the Danaher Death Squad in high-level competitions has reinvigorated interest and respect for leg lock systems within the broader martial arts community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:47">[01:55:47]</a>.

## Conclusion

Ultimately, the exploration and advancement of the leg lock system signify more than just the addition of another tool in a grappler's arsenal. It represents a shift toward a more holistic and strategic view of grappling, where the blend of art and science offers endless opportunities for innovation and mastery. As the understanding of [[technical_aspects_of_grappling_and_martial_arts | technical aspects of grappling and martial arts]] continues to grow, the evolution of leg locks and its integration into comprehensive fighting systems underscores the dynamic and ever-evolving nature of the sport.

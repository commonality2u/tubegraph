### Engineering and Innovation

Yay emphasizes the importance of [[martial_arts_journey | engineering]] as a foundational element of both personal and societal progress. He believes that education should prioritize engineering over what he views as subjective subjects like history, which he argues are often written by victors and thus subject to bias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Yay's drive to innovate is reflected in his interest in architecture, fashion, and technology, where he wishes to apply engineering principles to create products and systems that serve people genuinely.

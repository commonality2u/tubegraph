The experience of performing with legendary guitarist Jeff Beck at the 2007 Crossroads Festival was a phenomenal milestone in T. Wilkenfeld's career. This festival, hosted by Eric Clapton, is one of the most significant guitar events globally, featuring around 400 guitarists, all showcasing their solo performances throughout the night [00:02:31].

## The Performance and the Iconic Solo

During the festival, T. Wilkenfeld, an accomplished bassist, was given the unexpected honor of performing a solo on one of Jeff Beck's well-known songs, **Cause We've Ended as Lovers**, originally written by Stevie Wonder. Jeff Beck, known for his generosity and openness as a musician, decided to let T. Wilkenfeld take the spotlight, showcasing the bass solo instead of performing it himself. This decision highlighted Beck's willingness to prioritize the music over personal recognition, demonstrating his characteristic generosity and love for collaborative music-making [00:02:58].

This generous gesture by Jeff Beck allowed T. Wilkenfeld to shine. Her performance at the Crossroads Festival remains an iconic moment, celebrated by fans and musicians alike [00:03:06].

## Overcoming Challenges and Fear

Despite the limelight and the pressure that comes with performing at such a prestigious event, T. Wilkenfeld did not feel nervous. She describes the presence of an adrenaline rush, but emphasizes the importance of leaving fear behind when performing. According to her, bringing fear to the bandstand can limit one’s potential and isolate oneself from the collaborative energy that is essential to expansive and authentic music-making [00:03:09].

This approach aligns with the wisdom shared by the great composers of the past. For instance, Beethoven is famously quoted: 

> [!quote] Beethoven's Perspective
> "To play a wrong note is insignificant; to play without passion is inexcusable."

## The Audition Incident

Leading up to the festival performance, T. Wilkenfeld experienced an unusual challenge. During her audition for Jeff Beck, she suffered from food poisoning upon arrival. Despite this setback, she managed to impress Beck with her playing during the rehearsal, and he decided to incorporate a bass solo into the performance, a feature that had not been part of the song before her involvement [00:03:59].

## The Aftermath

The performance and Wilkenfeld’s solo birthed a memorable presence in the music world, celebrating not only the skills and courage of a young bassist but also Jeff Beck’s spirit of encouragement and great music. Their collaboration at the festival remains a compelling story of musical partnership and a cornerstone in T. Wilkenfeld’s musical journey. Her experience with Jeff Beck at the Crossroads Festival serves as an exemplification of the profound trust and chemistry that can exist between musicians when fear is left behind and pure expression is embraced [00:04:09].

## The Role of Chemical Reactions and Constraints in Assembly Theory

Assembly theory offers a fascinating lens through which to view the complexity of objects in the universe. Developed as a framework to quantify how complex an object is, it considers the number of steps a process took to create it and whether it was built via evolutionary processes. At its core, assembly theory challenges conventional notions by re-evaluating the role and existence of chemical reactions within the framework of constraints.

### 1. Redefining Chemical Reactions

Lee Cronin, a chemist from the University of Glasgow, posits an intriguing idea: "chemical reactions do not exist" in the way we traditionally conceive them. Instead, what exists are constraints that enable chemical transformations to occur. This perspective shifts the focus from viewing chemical reactions as isolated events to understanding them as constrained processes shaped by the physical and chemical environment of Earth, such as gravity and atmospheric pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>.

### 2. The Importance of Constraints

Constraints are pivotal in assembly theory. They define the possibilities of assembly by imposing limits based on the environment and available materials. Chemistry on Earth is a result of these applied constraints, where the availability of certain elements and conditions dictate the feasible reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>.

Cronin emphasizes this re-conceptualization by noting that chemical reactions operate under conditions that are often meticulously controlled for experiments and creations. This viewpoint highlights the significance of understanding environments and constraints when considering assembly processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:13">[01:28:13]</a>.

### 3. Assembly Theoryâ€™s View on Chemical Reactions

In assembly theory, objects endure over time because they are selected by the environment according to how well they adhere to these constraints. The theory posits that assembly processes do not just occur at random, but are guided by a logical series of constraints that influence the stability and creation of objects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>.

This concept challenges traditional chemistry, offering a new perspective that the constraints, not the reactions themselves, dictate the outcome of chemical transformations and the evolution of complex structures. Assembly theory thus provides a profound insight into understanding the evolution and persistence of complex systems from a chemical standpoint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:10">[02:09:10]</a>.

### Conclusion

The role of chemical reactions and constraints in assembly theory invites us to reconsider how we view the formation and evolution of complexity in the universe. By shifting focus from reactions to constraints, this theory opens pathways for new interpretations in chemistry and broader scientific inquiry. The implications of this shift emphasize the importance of constraints as active contributors to the formation and evolution of complex structures in our universe.

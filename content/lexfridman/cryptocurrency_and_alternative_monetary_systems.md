Ray Dalio, a renowned investor and the founder of Bridgewater Associates, offers insight into the evolution and implications of cryptocurrency as alternative monetary systems on modern economies. During a conversation hosted on the Lex Fridman Podcast, Dalio delves into the role of cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, the competitive landscape created by fiat money depreciation, and the broader implications on global financial systems.

## Competing Monetary Systems

With the increasing depreciation of fiat currencies, Dalio predicts a burgeoning competition among different forms of money. This includes not only cryptocurrencies but also potential central bank digital currencies. According to Dalio, we are entering an era characterized by a **competition of monies** driven by the relentless printing of fiat money, pushing alternative systems like Bitcoin into the limelight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:39">[01:14:39]</a>.

### Bitcoin as an Alternative to Gold

Dalio compares Bitcoin to gold, seeing it as another form of alternative currency system. While Bitcoin has proven itself over its existence and is engaging for many people, its status as an alternative money forms part of a broader mix, akin to gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:01">[01:15:01]</a>.

Despite its potential, Dalio remains cautious about Bitcoin surpassing gold in terms of market cap value, predicting it may only reach up to 20% of gold's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:39">[01:18:39]</a>.

## Prospects of Bitcoin's Value

Reflecting on Bitcoin reaching a high of 69,000 USD, Dalio is skeptical about extreme predictions like Bitcoin reaching one million dollars. Such valuation would imply surpassing gold as a benchmark, which he considers unlikely given the current economic valuation of alternative currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:57">[01:18:57]</a>.

## Broadening Currency Horizons

Dalio mentions that beyond cryptocurrencies, other assets like non-fungible tokens (NFTs) could play significant roles as alternative forms of money. While he hasn't purchased NFTs yet, he acknowledges the broad spectrum of potential monetary competition that includes various digital and physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:21">[01:15:21]</a>.

### Gold vs. Bitcoin

Gold retains many advantages over Bitcoin, such as anonymity and a long historical precedent as a universally accepted store of value. These attributes provide connectivity-free advantages, especially in scenarios where traceability might pose risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:53">[01:16:53]</a>.

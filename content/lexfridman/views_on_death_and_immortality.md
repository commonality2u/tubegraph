The discussion with RZA delves deeply into the themes of death, immortality, and how these notions influence our understanding of life. Throughout the podcast, RZA shares profound insights drawn from personal experience, philosophical inquiry, and cultural exploration.

## The Loss of a Mother and Realizations About Life

RZA recounts how the passing of his mother significantly impacted his life. He describes this loss as cutting a vital link to the universe, emphasizing the physical and mental loss that accompanies such an event. RZA reflects on the **etheric cord**, an invisible connection to one's soul and the soul of others, which is severed upon death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Mortality vs. Immortality

One of the key realizations RZA discusses is the distinction between mortality and immortality. He highlights that facing the death of his mother brought a greater understanding of his physical mortality while reinforcing a belief in the immortality of the soul <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. 

This experience led him to appreciate life more profoundly, recognizing that while the physical body is temporary, the essence or soul is eternal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. He draws an analogy to James Brown, indicating that while Brown is no longer alive, his essence persists through his music and the memories of him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Reflections on the Concept of God and Divinity

The conversation also explores religious and philosophical interpretations of divinity. RZA describes an evolution in his understanding of what it means to be a "god" based on his teachings and experiences. Initially, the notion of being a god was linked to supreme wisdom, strength, and beauty as conceptualized in historical languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. However, the inability to revive his mother led RZA to question the literal interpretation of such divine attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

He reflects on the understanding of God as a being of wisdom and strength rather than an all-powerful deity capable of controlling life and death. This realigned his focus towards appreciating the wisdom and beauty inherited from his mother and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Perspectives on Death and Fear

When asked about his fear of death, RZA expresses a stoic acceptance, acknowledging that while he is not afraid, he is not eager to face it either. He quotes Bodhidharma, emphasizing the uncertainty of what lies beyond death and embracing the unknown with the knowledge that life is the only certainty he has <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

## The Influence of Life Experiences on Philosophy

RZA's insights are heavily influenced by his life experiences, including familial bonds and philosophical learning. The appreciation of his mother and his wife's roles deepens his philosophical stance, allowing him to see the beauty in life and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. His understanding of mortality becomes intertwined with elements of love, family legacy, and the ongoing influence of loved ones past and present.

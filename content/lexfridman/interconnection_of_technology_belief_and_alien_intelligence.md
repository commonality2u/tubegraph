The intertwined nature of technology, belief, and the concept of alien intelligence is a complex and multifaceted subject worthy of exploration. In her book, *American Cosmic: UFOs, Religion, Technology*, Diana Walsh Pasulka, a scholar of philosophy and religious studies, delves into how these elements interact and shape our understanding of the world. This exploration offers insights into how beliefs in the realm of [[extraterrestrial_life_and_intelligent_civilizations | extraterrestrial life]] can influence technological advancement and vice versa, indicating a profound psychic and societal impact.

## The Nature of Belief and Objective Reality

Belief, as discussed by Pasulka, is a powerful force that dictates human actions and perceptions. Philosophers have long pondered the veracity of beliefs in regard to objective reality, often questioning what is truly 'real' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Pasulka references Immanuel Kant, who theorized about the "thing in itself," suggesting that our understanding of reality is limited by our senses and faculties, which can sometimes deceive us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### Impact of Belief on Society

Beliefs, even when erroneous, have had tangible effects on society. Historical beliefs, like the geocentric view of the universe or the flat earth theory, have influenced actions and worldviews until challenged by evidence and new understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Pasulka warns against the potential harm of unchecked beliefs but also acknowledges how shared beliefs can unify people under a common cause or idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

## Technology as an Extension of Human Belief

Pasulka argues that technology can manifest from the mythology embedded within our collective intelligence, transforming the seemingly impossible into reality through innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This belief-driven creation of technology is akin to the religious experience, where technology serves as an extension of human faculties, much like the teachings of Marshall McLuhan, who proposed that "technology is like an extension of our senses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

### The Influence of Alien Intelligence

In *American Cosmic*, Pasulka explores the narratives surrounding UFOs and their parallels to religious experiences, suggesting that belief in [[alien_life_and_the_search_for_extraterrestrial_intelligence | alien life]] might be equivalent to a modern form of religiosity. The belief in non-human intelligence—or extraterrestrials—drives people to seek understanding in realms beyond traditional science, much like early religious quests for understanding the divine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:26">[00:22:26]</a>.

## The Relationship Between Extraterrestrial Belief and Technological Innovation

A particularly engaging aspect of Pasulka's work is the examination of how beliefs in alien civilizations can spur technological innovations. She notes that certain individuals claim to receive "downloads" of information from non-human intelligences, leading to advancements in technology that have real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. This phenomenon underscores the significance of belief in driving humanity’s relentless pursuit of technological advancement.

## Conclusion

The interconnection between technology, belief, and alien intelligence provides a framework for understanding how human beings interpret and interact with the unknown. This complex relationship highlights the way shared myths and beliefs can drive innovation and shape the collective consciousness in profound ways, echoing themes of [[possibility_and_implications_of_alien_life | the possibility and implications of alien life]] that have fascinated humanity throughout history. As technology continues to advance, the lines between belief and reality may further blur, presenting new paradigms for exploration and understanding.

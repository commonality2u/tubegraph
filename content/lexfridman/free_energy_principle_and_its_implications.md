## Introduction

The Free Energy Principle, formulated by neuroscientist Karl Friston, offers a unifying framework for understanding biological systems, particularly the brain's function. It posits that all biological systems, which successfully sustain themselves in changing environments, can be modeled as inference problems. This principle suggests that systems minimize a quantity known as "free energy," which is akin to maximizing evidence for their own existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Theoretical Foundation

### Existential Imperative as Inference

The core idea behind the Free Energy Principle is that the probability of a system’s existence can be seen as evidence of its existence. Expressing this as a statistical problem allows the use of mathematical tools developed for inference to describe the dynamics of systems. In essence, the principle states that any system that can maintain a separation from its environment will appear to minimize something known as variational free energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

### Connection to Machine Learning

The Free Energy Principle draws heavily from machine learning, particularly the concept of the "evidence lower bound" (elbo), which is about maximizing the marginal likelihood or evidence for a system’s existence. This principle has implications for understanding various aspects of biology and cognition as inference problems where systems strive to minimize free energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:03">[00:45:03]</a>.

## Implications for Understanding Biological Systems

### Modeling Non-Equilibrium Systems

The Free Energy Principle provides a framework for modeling non-equilibrium steady states—a characteristic of living systems that are constantly exchanging matter and energy with their environment. The principle implies that living organisms are not merely reactive but are actively engaged in minimizing their free energy, thereby preserving their structure and autonomy over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:54">[00:58:54]</a>.

### Autonomy and Existence

According to the Free Energy Principle, a system's autonomy is manifested through its capacity to enact movements that are inferred from its internal states. Autonomous systems pursue minimizing free energy to maintain homeostasis and adapt to their environments. This capacity for action is a distinguishing feature of living systems compared to non-living systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:11">[01:03:11]</a>.

### Life and Consciousness

The principle provides a theoretical basis for differentiating between living and non-living systems. A living system actively seeks to regulate itself and its environment to maintain its existence, demonstrated through its ability to move and interact autonomously. This framework suggests that consciousness and the capacity for planning can be viewed as advanced manifestations of this fundamental pursuit of minimizing free energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:34">[01:10:34]</a>.

## Practical Applications

### Designing Artificial Systems

The Free Energy Principle offers a blueprint for designing artificial systems or [[thermodynamics_and_physicsbased_ai | AI]] that mimic biological processes. By specifying a generative model and engineering systems to perform gradient descent on this model, artificial systems could exhibit autonomous, self-evidencing behaviors similar to living organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The Free Energy Principle serves as a foundational theory for understanding both the emergence and maintenance of life, and potentially consciousness. It describes existence itself as a process of inference and optimization, providing a comprehensive framework to explore the mysteries of life, intelligence, and even artificial systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

Waymo's story is a fascinating tale of technological evolution and corporate strategy, rooted in one of the most challenging fields of artificial intelligence: autonomous driving. It started as a project within Google and has since evolved into an independent company leading the charge in autonomous vehicle technology.

## The Genesis: Google’s Self-Driving Car Project

The autonomous driving endeavor began as Google's self-driving car project in 2009. [It was initiated by a small team of around a dozen people](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>) who aimed to push the boundaries of what was possible in the field of autonomous vehicles. Google founders Larry Page and Sergey Brin, inspired by the DARPA Urban Challenge, saw the potential of autonomous technology to reshape transportation. [Dmitri Dolgov, who later became the CTO of Waymo, was part of this pioneering effort](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>).

## Initial Challenges and Breakthroughs

In its early stages, the project focused on understanding the full scope of the autonomous driving challenge. Two primary milestones guided their initial work: driving 100,000 miles in autonomous mode and undertaking 10 very complex 100-mile routes without human intervention. [This endeavor helped them realize the potential and feasibility of autonomous driving](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>), although it was clear there was much to learn about the problem space.

## Transition to Waymo

By 2016, Google’s self-driving car project had gained significant traction and technological progress, prompting the formation of Waymo. The decision to spin off into an independent entity was part of a broader strategy under Alphabet, Google's parent company, to focus Waymo on the commercial deployment of autonomous driving technology. [Waymo was officially launched at the end of 2016 and the beginning of 2017](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>).

## Milestones in Technology and Deployment

One of the pivotal moments for Waymo was in 2015, when they conducted the world's first fully driverless ride on public roads with a passenger. This was done in a custom-built vehicle without steering wheels or pedals, showing a significant leap forward in trust and technological capability. [This event marked Waymo's commitment to fully driverless technology](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:18">[00:32:18]</a>).

In 2017, Waymo began regular driverless operations, a critical step that set the stage for expanding public and commercial services. By 2018, they had launched Waymo One, a commercial ride-hailing service in Phoenix, Arizona, which later became open to the general public in 2020. This marked the first public collaboration of its kind, indicating Waymo's readiness for a broader deployment. [October 8, 2020, was a significant date as Waymo opened this service to all users in the Phoenix area](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:36">[00:53:36]</a>).

## Strategic Vision and Future Prospects

Waymo's goals extend beyond just perfecting autonomous vehicle technology; they are also committed to transforming transportation. [Their approach includes continuously refining their hardware and software to create robust, scalable systems for large-scale deployment](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:10">[01:26:10]</a>).

The company is focused on expanding its services beyond Phoenix, with a careful, measured approach to scalability and commercialization. This includes enhancing their fleet management capabilities and engaging in strategic partnerships across different cities. The ultimate vision is to create a seamless, safe, and widely accessible autonomous transport solution that could redefine the future of mobility globally.

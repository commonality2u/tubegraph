Meta reasoning, or reasoning about reasoning, is a critical concept in artificial intelligence (AI) that involves machines managing their own computation. This self-management allows AI systems to determine what to focus on, thereby improving decision-making efficiency and effectiveness. This approach is particularly beneficial in contexts where the decision space, such as a game or real-world planning, is vast and complex.

## Early Development of Meta Reasoning

The concept of meta reasoning has its roots in game-playing programs. For instance, when designing an AI to play chess, it's essential to decide which parts of the search tree are worth exploring. The search tree represents all possible moves and outcomes, and it's usually vast, often larger than the number of atoms in the universe. Successful AI programs, like human players, only examine a small fraction of the search tree. Choosing the right fraction is crucial for performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>.

Stuart Russell, a professor of computer science at UC Berkeley, highlighted these ideas when discussing his work on game-playing AI like Othello and backgammon. His research demonstrated that AI programs could be more efficient than the standard alpha-beta search by incorporating meta reasoning techniques. These techniques allowed AI systems to effectively evaluate which parts of a problem space were worth exploring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>.

## Application in Modern AI

Modern AI systems, such as those used in [[metalearning_in_artificial_intelligence | AlphaGo]] and AlphaZero, also apply meta reasoning. These systems explore decision trees to extraordinary depths by selectively evaluating feasible and promising moves. For example, AlphaGo can play at a professional level even when restricted to examining only the immediate outcomes of its moves, illustrating its superior intuitive understanding of board evaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>.

The learning in systems like AlphaGo occurs in two primary ways:

1. Evaluating board positions to gauge how promising a certain situation is.
2. Using a form of meta reasoning to decide which paths in the decision tree to explore <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09">[06:09]</a>.

## Insights into Decision Path Selection

The decision on which paths to explore involves gauging both the potential and uncertainty of a decision. It's important because an AI should only invest time in exploring decisions that might yield a change in the final decision's quality. This process is analogous to human thinking, where the decision-making involves intuitively assessing the situation and determining which possibilities are worth the cognitive effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50">[07:50]</a>.

## The Role in Real-World Applications

Meta reasoning is not solely an academic exercise. Its principles are applied in broader AI systems across different areas, including [[causal_reasoning_in_ai | causal reasoning in AI]], [[common_sense_in_artificial_intelligence]], and applications that involve direct interaction with the world, such as autonomous vehicles. These systems must constantly assess which computations and perceptual inputs are valuable to improve efficacy in unpredictable environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03">[24:03]</a>.

## Summary

Meta reasoning represents a vital paradigm in artificial intelligence, enabling systems to optimize their decision-making pathways by focusing computational resources on the most promising areas of exploration. By continuously improving the ways AI defines what to think about, meta reasoning enhances AI's capability to make intelligent decisions within complex environments, potentially surpassing human capabilities in specific tasks. This progress offers significant advances for AI's impact in real-world applications, positioning it as a crucial component in the development of next-generation AI systems.

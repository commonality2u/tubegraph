The integration of cognitive science with AI engineering is a critical area of exploration aiming to enhance artificial intelligence by drawing insights from how human intelligence operates. This approach advocates for a reverse-engineering methodology where the scientific understanding of human cognition informs the development of advanced AI systems.

## Overview

Prof. Josh Tenenbaum at MIT leads pioneering research in this domain, focusing on how humans learn so efficiently from minimal data and applying these principles to create AI systems that learn with similar efficacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Tenenbaum’s work is embedded in MIT's Center for Brains, Minds, and Machines (CBMM), a collaborative platform funded by the NSF, which bridges the gap between the science and engineering of intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## The Cognitive Science Approach

The cognitive science approach to AI focuses on understanding the fundamental processes of human learning and reasoning. It emphasizes not only pattern recognition but also modeling the world, imagination, goal-setting, planning, and communication—a spectrum of activities that reflect the richness of human intelligence beyond mere data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Reverse Engineering Human Intelligence

Tenenbaum argues that capturing intelligence requires a broader toolset than currently provided by deep learning alone. The aim is to model world understanding, explaining and imagining unseen scenarios, and solving problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Researchers at CBMM believe that by reverse engineering the cognitive processes of the human brain, they can offer pathways to engineering intelligence in machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

## Cognitive Architectures and AI

A crucial element in this integration is developing a cognitive architecture that mirrors human cognition. This involves understanding perception, cognition, and action at a level of detail that allows for the emulation in AI systems. Tenenbaum discusses an architecture inspired by the brain, noting that despite the success of neural networks, they still fall short in replicating the true flexibility and general-purpose intelligence seen in humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Symbolic and Nonsymbolic AI

The integration of symbolic and nonsymbolic elements is imperative for building systems that emulate human thinking. By leveraging probabilistic programming, AI can capture the uncertainty and ambiguity characteristic of human thought while employing symbolic methods to encode intricate knowledge about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:24">[00:45:24]</a>.

## Applications and Challenges

The ultimate goal of integrating cognitive science with AI is to create systems that are not only capable of learning in a human-like manner but are also efficient in their energy consumption akin to the human brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. This poses a significant challenge to current AI systems, which are power-hungry compared to the human brain’s efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:04">[01:27:04]</a>.

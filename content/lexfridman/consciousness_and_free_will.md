The intricate relationship between consciousness and free will is a topic that has fascinated thinkers for centuries, spanning disciplines from philosophy to neuroscience. In a conversation with chemist Lee Cronin, various aspects of this relationship are explored, particularly in the context of [[consciousness_and_reality | consciousness and reality]], and how our understanding might be shaped by scientific insights into the origins of life and the universe.

## Understanding Consciousness

Consciousness is often considered the universe developing a kind of memory, a theme that Lee Cronin explores through his work in chemistry and computational systems. According to Cronin, life can be seen as the universe's way of developing a memory, and this memory is embedded in the complexity of objects and systems that exist within the universe.

Cronin suggests that consciousness is not just an isolated phenomenon but is deeply linked with the physical processes of the universe, hinting at a kind of selection process that preceded biological life.

## The Illusion of Free Will

The question of free will has long been debated in both philosophical and scientific circles. Some argue that free will is an illusion, while others propose that we possess episodic freedom of choice. Cronin offers an interesting perspective by suggesting that our free will is constrained by past choices and the complexity of our mind's models.

> "I have some will, and I think I am an agent and I think I can interact and I can play around with my with the models I have of the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:39">[02:13:39]</a>

In a nod to [[the_illusion_of_free_will | the illusion of free will]], he implies that while our choices may indeed be limited by the memory and the causal chains of the universe, we still experience and exercise agency within those constraints.

## Computational Models and Consciousness

Cronin's work in developing chemical computers and exploring the origins of life includes a fascinating intersection with the nature of consciousness. By constructing complex networks through chemical interactions, Cronin mirrors some of the processes thought to be at the heart of conscious experience.

### Computational Abstractions

Through his engagement with chem-based computation, Cronin highlights how chemical interactions simulate some form of decision-making process akin to that in conscious minds:

> "Assembly theory, a theory goes back a few years... allows you to then look at the universe slightly differently." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>

Assembly theory provides a framework for understanding how complex, causally inter-related systems develop, which may potentially reflect upon how consciousness itself arises from simpler processes.

## Free Will and the Constraints of Memory

The conversation brought in references to various philosophies, including that of Nietzsche, suggesting he understood freedom as limited, rather than absolute. This aligns with the idea that consciousness and free will operate within constraints, guided by the accumulated decisions and memories:

> "Assembly theory says... if you have these constraints in your past, they limit what you are able to do in the future." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:45">[02:15:45]</a>

There may be a semblance of choice within those limitations, but ultimately, the narrative we call 'free will' might be another layer in the intricate tapestry of consciousness that is constantly being woven by the universe. 

## Future Perspectives

While the precise role of consciousness in free will remains elusive, ongoing research into systems like those Cronin examines could offer new insights. Whether through understanding the chemical origins of life or the reactivity of complex molecules, these studies provide a vivid lens through which we might better comprehend how conscious thought arises and operates.

By expanding our understanding of both the physical and abstract dimensions of consciousness, we can continue refining the questions we ask about free will, perhaps leading to a more integrated understanding of what it means to possess it in a universe governed by deterministic and stochastic processes alike.

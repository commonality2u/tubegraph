The complex and multifaceted conflict between Israel and Palestine serves as a key example of how the international community and media play a pivotal role in shaping perceptions and influencing outcomes in global conflicts. This article seeks to explore these roles through the insights shared by Muhammad Alcard, a Palestinian poet, writer, and journalist, during his discussion on the podcast.

## International Community's Influence

The international community, represented through organizations and foreign governments, has historically had significant sway over the trajectory of the [[international_relations_and_conflict_resolution | Israeli-Palestinian conflict]]. Among various geopolitical maneuvers, the Balfour Declaration by the British in 1917, which committed to establishing a Jewish state in Palestine, is highlighted as a foundational event that enshrines international involvement in the region's conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20">[22:20]</a>.

In recent times, accords like the Abraham Accords, which normalized relations between Israel and several Arab states, have been criticized as efforts that overlook Palestinian interests for regional strategic gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10">[44:10]</a>. These accords are often presented as religious reconciliations but are primarily about arms deals and mutual economic interests, further distancing Palestinian aspirations for statehood and self-determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:55">[43:55]</a>.

### United States' Role

The United States has been a major player, providing substantial military aid to Israel, perpetuating the conflict, as argued by Alcard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:06">[38:06]</a>. Despite shifting public opinion in the U.S. towards more Palestinian sympathies, political actions tend to lag behind, evidenced by strong bipartisan support for Israel in Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:30">[37:30]</a>.

## Media's Influence

Media portrayal impacts both public opinion and international policy regarding conflicts. In the case of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, media coverage often lacks critical context, such as acknowledging Palestinian territories as occupied, which can skew public perception and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:15">[59:15]</a>.

### Role of Media in Shaping Narratives

The [[role_of_media_in_shaping_narratives | role of media in shaping narratives]] cannot be overstated. Alcard points out that Israeli narratives often dominate, with Western media frequently omitting critical contexts or presenting misleading headlines, such as characterizing Palestinian homes threatened by demolition as "illegally built" without noting the discriminatory nature of building permit denials for Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19">[13:19]</a>.

With the widespread availability of social media, however, Palestinians and their advocates have begun to counter these established media narratives. Alcard's own campaign in 2021 to stop the expulsion of families from Sheikh Jarrah managed to penetrate media cycles and mobilize global awareness, demonstrating the power of alternative media in shaping public discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36">[08:36]</a>.

### Media and Public Opinion

The [[role_of_media_in_shaping_public_opinion | media's power in shaping public opinion]] is further illustrated by the disparate responses to similar acts of resistance in different conflicts. Alcard cites the Western media's sympathetic portrayal of Ukrainian resistance compared to the negative portrayal of Palestinian resistance, highlighting a double standard that influences international views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:44">[44:44]</a>.

## Conclusion

The role of the international community and media is crucial in shaping the course and perception of conflicts like that between Israel and Palestine. While international politics often complicate or exacerbate the situation, media narratives can either sustain these complexities or help deconstruct them to promote understanding and empathy. For any meaningful conflict resolution or [[communication_and_empathy_in_conflict_resolution | empathy in conflict resolution]] to emerge, both international dynamics and media portrayals must be critically assessed and responsibly managed.

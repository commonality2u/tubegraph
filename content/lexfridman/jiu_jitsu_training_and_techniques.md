Jiu Jitsu, particularly Brazilian Jiu Jitsu (BJJ), is a dynamic martial art focusing on ground fighting and submission. It is a discipline beloved for its strategic depth and potential for infinite progression. At the heart of Jiu Jitsu training are fundamental techniques, positions, and the constant refinement of skills to adapt and counter opponents effectively.

## The B Team and their Approach

The B Team, a renowned Jiu Jitsu team based in Austin, Texas, comprises prominent grapplers such as Craig Jones, Nikki Rod, and Nikki Ryan. The distinguished team was formed after the dissolution of the legendary [[john_danahers_experiences_and_insights_into_grappling_and_jiu_jitsu | John Danaher]]’s Death Squad in Puerto Rico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The team’s philosophy leans toward professional athlete development, with an environment cultivated for both learning and high-level competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Training Routines and Philosophies

### Craig Jones' Perspective

Craig Jones, known for his tactical grappling and instructionals, takes a somewhat unconventional approach to his training routine. He often eschews conventional warm-ups and stresses that competition routines should mirror training experiences. His teaching style focuses on constraint-based learning, where students are presented with positional challenges before they are taught the solutions—a method he believes accelerates learning through practical problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

> “It's about using the body's natural reactions to solve problems—making it more about play and less about rigid structure” – Craig Jones

### Nikki Rod’s Pre-Match Rituals

Nikki Rod dedicates significant attention to his pre-match preparations. His routines involve visualization, simulating match-day environments, and employing mental strategies to maintain focus and readiness during competitions. He emphasizes the importance of physical preparation paired with mental conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:52">[01:51:52]</a>.

### Positional Training

The B Team places high importance on positional sparring as a core training methodology. This practice allows athletes to enhance specific skill sets by deliberately starting in challenging positions—such as bottom mount or turtle—to develop escape techniques and control, which are critical in both training and competition scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:01">[02:03:01]</a>.

## Common Techniques and Innovations

### Escape from the Bottom

One of the distinctive training elements introduced by Craig Jones is his “Just Stand Up” instructional, which challenges traditional methods and encourages using wrestling techniques to regain control from the bottom. This approach underscores the integration of cross-disciplinary techniques to enhance BJJ efficiency.

### The Rear Naked Choke (RNC)

The RNC remains a staple and one of the most effective submissions due to its versatility and high success rate in competition. Mastery of RNC is a key focus for any aspiring Jiu Jitsu practitioner, given its potential to end matches decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:01">[02:23:01]</a>.

## Challenges and Evolutions

BJJ continues to evolve with insights borrowed from other disciplines, like [[judo_techniques_and_training | Judo]] and wrestling. Grapplers must consistently adapt to the emerging strategies and techniques to stay relevant in the competitive scene.

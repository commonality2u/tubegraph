Hunger and famine are profound global challenges affecting millions worldwide. The conversation with [[skye_fitzgerald | Skye Fitzgerald]], a two-time Oscar-nominated documentary filmmaker, sheds light on the dire situation of hunger, specifically focusing on how conflicts exacerbate hunger and lead to famines.

## Global Hunger Crisis

As of now, nearly 811 million people globally are experiencing hunger, with 45 million on the edge of famine across 43 countries. Despite the existence of sufficient resources and food, hunger persists due to various socio-political factors [00:01:01](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:01:01).

## War and Famine

A significant contributor to hunger is war and intentional acts by leaders to starve entire populations, which is deeply disturbing. Starvation as a weapon of war continues to affect countries like Ethiopia, Ukraine, and Yemen, even when international laws like the Geneva Conventions aim to prevent it [00:01:49](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:01:49).

## The Humanitarian Perspective

The suffering caused by famines due to human actions is especially painful. Fitzgerald emphasizes the need for global empathy, suggesting that experiencing hunger and homelessness personally might lead to a more serious global approach to solving these issues [00:03:03](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=00:03:03).

The evolution of computational language and its impact on human thought represents a profound shift in how we interact with technology and conceive knowledge. This evolution is deeply intertwined with the understanding of computation as a conceptual framework for processing information and the role of language as a medium for expressing and organizing thought.

## Bridging Human and Machine: Natural and Computational Language

The development of Wolfram Alpha and the [[natural_language_understanding_and_computational_knowledge | integration of natural language]] with computational languages highlights the synergy between human cognition and machine computation. Wolfram's work emphasizes how the [[programming_languages_and_their_evolution | evolution of programming languages]] leads to a deeper understanding of the world by translating human concepts into precise, computable forms. This translation makes it possible to turn complex ideas into a computational framework that enables deep computation and advanced problem-solving.

## Computation as a Formalism of Thought

Computational thought has emerged as a new formalism, similar to the roles that logic and mathematics have played in shaping intellectual developments. Computation allows us to formalize observations, derive implications, and explore the consequences of complex systems in a systematic way. Stephen Wolfram notes that:

> "Computation thinking about the world computationally is a kind of formal way of thinking about the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:58">[03:31:58]</a>

This formalism provides a consistent language for representing knowledge, making it an essential part of education across various fields.

## The Role of Large Language Models

Large language models (LLMs) like ChatGPT exemplify the capability of computational systems to learn and generate language mirroring human interactions. These models underscore the importance of linguistic interfaces in democratizing access to computation, allowing more people to engage with complex systems without needing in-depth technical expertise.

## The Journey to Formalizing Complexity

Wolfram's exploration of cellular automata and their unexpected complexity reflects the broader quest to uncover the formal rules underlying complex phenomena. Cellular automata demonstrate how simple computational rules can yield intricate and unpredictable patterns, challenging the intuitive understanding of order and chaos.

## Computational Boundedness and Observer Perspective

The notion of computationally bounded observers and their interplay with computationally irreducible systems is crucial to understanding the limits of knowledge and predictability. This concept illustrates how our perceptions and interpretations of the universe are shaped by our computational capabilities and the abstractions we apply to process the vast complexity of the world around us.

## Implications for Future Thought

The evolution of computational language and thought is not just a technological advancement but a paradigm shift in how humans conceptualize and interact with the world. As Wolfram suggests, embracing computational thinking allows us to extend our intellectual reach far beyond traditional boundaries:

> "In terms of the kind of formalism of our physics project, we talk about this idea of rule space—the space of all possible rule systems—and different minds are, in a sense, at different points in rule space." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>

Understanding and leveraging computational language and thought empowers humanity to navigate and innovate within the ever-expanding computational universe. As this field continues to evolve, it offers new possibilities for problem-solving, scientific discovery, and the integration of [[the_evolution_of_human_cognition | human cognition]] with the technological landscape.

## Introduction
Reverse engineering human intelligence is a compelling approach in artificial intelligence (AI) research, aiming to bridge the science and engineering of intelligence by understanding how human intelligence arises in the mind and brain, and applying this understanding to build human-like intelligence in machines. This endeavor is pursued by researchers like Josh Tenenbaum from the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT), who leads initiatives focused on the basic science behind human cognition and its engineering applications in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## The Quest for Artificial General Intelligence (AGI)

### Distinguishing AI from AGI
While AI systems can perform tasks traditionally thought to require human intelligence, none possess truly general-purpose intelligence or common sense. Instead, these systems excel in narrow tasks like playing games such as Go but fail in domains outside their specific programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This highlights the gap between current AI technologies and the pursuit of a more human-like AGI.

### Understanding the Brain as a Basis for AI
Reverse engineering aims to understand key aspects of human cognition, such as visual intelligence and common sense reasoning, by replicating these in machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Visual intelligence, for example, involves perceiving a coherent world from limited sensory data, a task where humans excel but AI still lags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Challenges and Techniques

### Understanding Human Cognition
The human cognitive system seamlessly integrates perception, action, and high-level reasoning. A human can quickly estimate distances and count objects in a new environment, tasks that are straightforward for people but challenging for AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Probabilistic Programs and Game Engines
Probabilistic programming offers a framework for encoding models of human cognitive processes, such as intuitive physics or social reasoning, and simulating these models in AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Game engines serve as a practical analogy for building models that can handle complex interactions in dynamic environments, providing a scaffold for designing AI that mimics human object manipulation and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>.

## Implications and Future Directions

### From Human-like Understanding to Practical Applications
By understanding and mimicking human cognition in AI, there is potential for creating machines capable of more naturally interacting with humans, understanding contexts, making plans, and displaying common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### The Role of Emotion and Non-goal Oriented Cognition
Incorporating elements like emotions—integral to human intelligence—into AI systems could further enhance their ability to interpret and respond to complex human experiences. This facet remains an active area of exploration, emphasizing the importance of models that consider mental states and social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## Conclusion
Reverse engineering human intelligence for AI involves a complex interplay between scientific understanding and technological implementation. It requires innovative collaboration across disciplines to translate insights from cognitive science into AI systems that learn and adapt with a general understanding akin to human intelligence, pushing the frontier toward [[merging_human_intelligence_with_ai]] and overcoming [[challenges_in_building_humanlike_intelligence]].

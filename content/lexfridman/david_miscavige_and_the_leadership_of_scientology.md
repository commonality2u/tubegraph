David Miscavige is the current leader of the Church of Scientology, a role he assumed through a controversial and strategic maneuvering within the organization's hierarchy. His leadership has been marked by a combination of dedication to the teachings of L. Ron Hubbard, the founder of Scientology, and alleged authoritarian practices that have sparked considerable criticism and intrigue.

## The Rise to Power

David Miscavige's ascension to the top echelons of Scientology's power structure can be traced back to the final years of L. Ron Hubbard's life. During the last six years of Hubbard's life, Hubbard was in seclusion, primarily to evade multiple lawsuits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:31">[01:03:31]</a>. During this period, Miscavige had already made a name for himself as a doer within the organization known as the Commodore's Messenger Organization (CMO), which served Hubbard's interests directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[01:04:02]</a>. Through strategic control of information flow to Hubbard, Miscavige was able to eliminate rivals and consolidate his power. Eventually, he ousted Pat and Annie Broker, who were intended to be Hubbard's successors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:04">[01:08:04]</a>.

## Leadership Style

Miscavige's leadership is characterized by his unwavering faith in Scientology's teachings. He is viewed as a true believer, deeply committed to the churchâ€™s ideology, even though he is aware of damaging information regarding the church and L. Ron Hubbard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>. However, Miscavige also reportedly demonstrates a more pragmatic understanding of the limitations of Scientology's promises, such as knowing that advanced levels of operating thetan (OT) beyond OT 8 do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:23">[01:09:23]</a>.

### Claims of Authoritarianism and Abuse

Under Miscavige's leadership, Scientology's methods have been described as authoritarian, with strict control over the members' lives, including their access to information and private discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>. Allegations of physical abuse have been made, with former high-ranking members like Mike Rinder claiming to have been assaulted by Miscavige multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:21">[01:34:21]</a>. His leadership style has been paralleled with authoritarian figures in history, focusing on the control and manipulation of followers through charismatic and, at times, forceful means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.

## The Role of Secrecy

A fundamental part of Miscavige's leadership involves maintaining the secrecy surrounding the upper echelons of Scientology. The organization enforces strict confidentiality, especially concerning the higher OT levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>. This secrecy is enforced not only through internal policies but also through external means, utilizing legal and sometimes intimidating tactics to silence detractors or those who would leak sensitive information.

## Influence and Public Perception

Despite the controversies, Miscavige's leadership has managed to maintain Scientology's tax-exempt status, a critical achievement for the church's financial sustainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>. His relationship with high-profile members, notably actor Tom Cruise, suggests a blend of personal and professional alliances that bolster the church's public profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:55">[01:47:55]</a>. These relationships underline Miscavige's role not just as an administrative leader, but as a figurehead of Scientology's cultural and social influence.

## Conclusion

David Miscavige's tenure as the leader of Scientology is marked by a complex blend of unwavering commitment to the organization's core tenets and a controversial authoritarian style. His ability to navigate internal politics and external pressures showcases a highly strategic approach to leadership. However, the criticisms regarding his methods and the impact on followers' personal lives bring into question the sustainability of his leadership model within the broader context of religious freedom and human rights.

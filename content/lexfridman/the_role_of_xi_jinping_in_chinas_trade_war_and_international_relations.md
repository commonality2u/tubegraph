The evolving dynamics of China's trade war, particularly under the leadership of [[comparisons_between_xi_jinping_and_mao_zedong | Xi Jinping]], display a complex interplay of geopolitical strategies and domestic goals. This article dissects Xi Jinping's role in shaping China's international trade relations, examining his strategies against the backdrop of historical events and ideological narratives.

## Xi Jinping's Leadership in the Trade War

Under Xi Jinping, China's approach towards international trade, especially with the United States, has become a focal point of global economic discussions. The trade tensions escalated notably when former U.S. President Donald Trump implemented tariffs on Chinese imports, raising them to aggressive levels in a bid to recalibrate trade balances. Xi responded in kind by increasing tariffs on U.S. goods, further exacerbating the tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:19">[01:39:19]</a>.

Xi Jinping's strategy has involved portraying China as a "responsible superpower." In his speeches, Xi emphasized China's resilience and self-reliance, underscoring the nation's ability to withstand external pressures. He repeatedly positions China against the backdrop of historical victimization by foreign powers, a narrative deeply entrenched in the national psyche due to the "century of humiliation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>. This rhetoric aims to galvanize domestic support and fortify China's stance on the global stage.

## Cultural and Historical Context

One of the key elements that Xi Jinping leverages is the historical narrative of China rising from a period of subjugation. The Chinese government has frequently used historical parallels, such as the Korean War, where China stood against a major adversary, the United States, and triumphed without yielding. Mao Zedong's 1953 speech during the Korean War becomes a symbol of defiance, reinforcing the national ethos of resilience in the face of adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Strategic Implications for International Relations

China's approach under Xi Jinping favors maintaining stability while asserting its influence. The notion that "there are no winners in a trade war" is a recurrent theme in Xi's addresses, indicating a recognition of the potential global repercussions of sustained trade hostilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a>. At the same time, Xi Jinping's maneuvers in Southeast Asia aim to position China as a stabilizing force amid global uncertainties, seeking alliances with the European Union to counterbalance U.S. pressures.

Xi Jinping’s trade policies also have broader implications for multilateral relationships. By pitching China’s economic vision, Xi forwards a narrative of promoting a "reasonable multilateral global trading framework," appealing to nations wary of nearly century-long U.S. economic dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>.

## Conclusion: Balancing Act of Power and Principle

Xi Jinping's role in China's trade war and broader international relations is marked by a balancing act: asserting China’s resilience and sovereignty while navigating the intricacies of geopolitical alliances. His leadership underscores a strategic narrative that draws on historical memory and nationalistic pride, positioning China as both a rising power and a protector of global trade stability. As tensions continue, Xi's ability to leverage cultural rhetoric and historical precedent remains a crucial component of China's international strategy.

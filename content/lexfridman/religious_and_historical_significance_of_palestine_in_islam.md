Al-Aqsa holds deep reverence as it was the first Qibla, or direction of prayer, for Muslims before the direction was changed to Mecca. The mosque is also the site of the Prophet Muhammad's night journey and ascension to the heavens, an event known as Isra and Mi'raj <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:24">[02:05:24]</a>.

In this article, we explore Tulsi Gabbard's military service, her experiences during deployment, and her unique perspective on war. Gabbard, a former vice chair of the Democratic National Committee and a current independent thinker, has not shied away from expressing her opinions on topics such as the military-industrial complex and the true cost of war.

## Military Service

Tulsi Gabbard served in the U.S. military for several years, achieving the rank of Lieutenant Colonel. Her service included deployments in Iraq from 2004 to 2005 and subsequent deployments to Kuwait in 2008 and 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. During her first deployment, she was assigned to a medical unit at the height of the Iraq War in 2005, a period that significantly shaped her understanding of the realities of war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Daily Realities and Lessons

Gabbard's daily tasks included reviewing lists of soldiers injured in combat the previous day, offering her a profound insight into the human cost of war. This experience never became routine; the lists were a stark reminder of the high human cost endured by soldiers and affected civilians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Friends lost in combat and the constant awareness of casualties deeply affected her understanding of military conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Her deployment also exposed her to the financial cost of war, notably through the operations of companies like KBR Halliburton, where exorbitant charges for basic services highlighted issues of war profiteering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Witnessing these dynamics led Gabbard to question the decisions made in Washington and consider ways to make a positive impact using her experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Perspective on War

Gabbard believes warfare should be a last resort, justified only in circumstances that directly threaten national security and when all diplomatic avenues have been exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>. Her views are deeply influenced by the complexities and cost of prolonged conflicts such as those in Iraq and Afghanistan, where objectives became blurred over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

> "War is justified when it is in the best interest of our national security and when it is the last resort after diplomatic efforts have been completed and exhausted." - Tulsi Gabbard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:12">[00:17:12]</a>

### Critique of U.S. Foreign Policy

Gabbard has been vocal in her criticism of U.S. foreign policy, particularly concerning the "War on Terror." She argues that shifting objectives have prolonged conflicts unnecessarily, often undermining national security interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>. Gabbard highlights that the military-industrial complex, with its extensive influence and connections, perpetuates these cycles of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Ethical and Cultural Considerations

Gabbardâ€™s service experience also included witnessing the cultural impacts of war, such as developing meaningful human connections with local communities in Iraq, which significantly reduced hostilities and improved safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. Her approach emphasizes the importance of understanding cultural and human elements in achieving peace and security.

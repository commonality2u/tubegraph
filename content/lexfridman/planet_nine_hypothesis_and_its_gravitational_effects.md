## Introduction
The concept of Planet Nine refers to a hypothetical ninth planet located in the outer solar system. This idea has been a topic of significant interest and discussion in the field of planetary astrophysics. According to planetary astrophysicist [[life_as_a_planetary_phenomenon | Constantine Batygin]], Planet Nine is believed to exist beyond the orbit of Neptune, with an orbital period of about 10,000 years and a mass approximately five times that of Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18">[01:18]</a>.

## Evidence and Characteristics

### Orbital Characteristics
Planet Nine is hypothesized to have an eccentric and slightly tilted orbit compared to the other planets in the solar system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. The existence of Planet Nine is proposed based on the gravitational clustering of several Trans-Neptunian Objects (TNOs). These objects share similar angular momentum orientations, a pattern that could be explained by the gravitational influence of a massive, distant planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.

### Gravitational Influence
Planet Nine's gravitational effects are thought to cause the alignment of TNO orbits with long periods and large semi-major axes, which is a departure from what would be expected if these objects were influenced only by known planets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a>. The presence of objects with orbits highly inclined or perpendicular to the plane of the solar system is another anomaly adequately explained by the Planet Nine hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:19">[01:02:19]</a>.

## An Alternative Explanation: Primordial Black Hole
Some astrophysicists speculate whether Planet Nine might not be a planet at all but a [[possibility_of_primordial_black_holes_among_planetary_bodies | primordial black hole]]. This alternative hypothesis arises from the difficulties in directly observing such a distant and dim object. Since black holes do not emit light, a primordial black hole of similar mass could exert similar gravitational influences without being directly observable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

## Searching for Planet Nine
The search for Planet Nine involves scanning the sky with telescopes to find a faint, reflecting body far from the Sun. Detection would rely on observing reflected sunlight, which would confirm the existence of a large, distant object <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:35">[01:09:35]</a>. Future surveys, such as those conducted by the Vera Rubin Observatory, are anticipated to provide more data that could either support or refute the Planet Nine hypothesis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:10">[01:52:10]</a>.

## Conclusion
The Planet Nine hypothesis remains one of the most intriguing topics in modern astronomy, suggesting a new understanding of our solar system's structure. Its confirmation would not only resolve existing anomalies in our observations of TNOs but also add a profound new dimension to theories of solar system formation and evolution. Whether Planet Nine is a planet or a possibility of a [[gravitational_waves | primordial black hole]] remains a question of significant scientific intrigue and investigation.

The question of what constitutes life has puzzled scientists and philosophers alike for centuries. This article explores the origin and definition of life, delving into the complex interplay between living organisms and the broader universe.

## Understanding Life's Origin

Life on Earth is believed to have evolved over at least 4 billion years, eventually developing what is known today as the **technosphere** â€” a complex network of technologies that exhibit life-like properties. These technologies can reproduce and sustain themselves, expanding our understanding of what life can be outside of biological organisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, Sarah Walker, argues that life is a universal framework of principles that allow organisms to adapt and evolve, a perspective that might eventually lead us to recognize forms of life that are vastly different from what we currently know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Materialists vs. Vitalists

In her book, *Life as No One Knows It: The Physics of Life's Emergence*, Walker discusses the divide between *materialists*, who view life as purely a physical phenomenon, and *vitalists*, who believe there is some non-physical essence, such as a soul, that animates life. According to Walker, while materialists see life as an assembly of matter and physical forces, vitalists argue for a dualistic interpretation where there's something beyond the physical that gives life its unique characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Complexity of Defining Life

Walker contends that life cannot easily be defined using standard biological textbook definitions, such as self-reproduction or metabolism, because these definitions often include non-living entities like machines. The boundaries of what constitutes life are blurred, as debates arise when considering entities like viruses, which exist at the threshold of living and non-living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Assembly Theory and Life's Attributes

Walker introduces the concept of **assembly theory** to illustrate how life formats complexity. According to this theory, complex objects are scaffolded from simpler ones over time through evolutionary processes, revealing that life is deeply entwined with the structure of the universe itself. It is through assembly theory that Walker seeks to redefine life as the process through which information structures matter across time and space, allowing for an increasing complexity of evolving entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Universal Principles of Life

Another fascinating concept explored is that these principles are not bound by earthly environments or biological constraints. Walker stresses that life's universal principles could allow for the existence and recognition of life even in environments that are starkly different from those found on Earth. This notion could revolutionize our search for life beyond our planet and contribute to developing a more inclusive definition of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

## The Implications of Understanding Life

Understanding life fundamentally alters our perception of ourselves and the universe. Walker believes that understanding the origin of life on Earth is intertwined with the search for [[universal_principles_of_life_and_the_search_for_alien_life | alien life]], as solving one could inherently unravel the mysteries of the other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:02">[01:31:02]</a>.

In conclusion, the origin and definition of life remain open questions, interlinked with broader universal principles and subjects of rigorous scientific inquiry. Walker's work exemplifies the ongoing quest to understand not only what life is and how it arose but also its potential manifestations beyond our current comprehension.

Confucianism has long been one of the defining philosophies in Chinese culture. Its tenets have profoundly influenced the country's social structures, educational system, and political ideologies, weaving themselves into the very fabric of Chinese identity. This article explores Confucianism’s enduring influence in modern China, juxtaposed with its historical roots and adaptations.

## Historical Context

Confucius, a Chinese philosopher born approximately 2500 years ago, left an indelible mark on Chinese society with his teachings. Although the exact historical details of Confucius’ life remain somewhat elusive, much like Socrates, our understanding is shaped by his followers' accounts and attributions of his philosophies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

During his era, Confucius saw a fractured China with waring kingdoms but claimed there had been an era of great order with clear relationships of hierarchy that kept society harmonious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Central to his teachings were the ideals of hierarchical relationships that demanded respect flowing both ways, such as father and son, husband and wife, emperor, and ministers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Confucian Ideals in a Modern Context

Confucian ideals remained salient throughout Chinese history, particularly the emphasis on hierarchy and respect within relationships. Confucianism emphasized the potential of education as a transformative tool, arguing that people start similarly at birth and diverge through education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:18">[01:11:18]</a>. This philosophy greatly contributed to China’s high regard for educational meritocracy, seen today in practices like the Gaokao, a national examination pivotal for university placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.

Confucianism posits that each role in society has a distinct set of responsibilities, creating an organized societal structure. These hierarchical relationships extended into views on governance, as both traditional and political authorities were seen through the lens of Confucian ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Confucianism vs. Marxism in China

While Confucianism promotes stability and hierarchy, it also finds itself inherently at odds with Marxism, with its emphasis on class struggle and progress through upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This contradiction is particularly salient in China, where both ideologies influence governance.

Xi Jinping, China’s current leader, has sought to integrate these teachings. Even though Mao Zedong opposed Confucianism, XIXi Jinping has approached it as reconcilable with communist ideals. He emphasizes stability and social unity, values aligned with Confucian teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Confucianism in International Relations

Confucianism also bears influence on China’s international posture, often reflected in a preference for stability and predictability. Historically, these ideals guided diplomatic interactions, expressing China's preference for harmonious global relations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

Confucianism remains a key pillar of Chinese philosophy and culture. Despite the tumultuous history and shifts toward communism, Confucian ideals continue to guide personal conduct, education, and governance in modern China. It serves as a cultural keystone in China's socio-political landscape, influencing both domestic and foreign policies. With leaders like Xi Jinping drawing from both Confucianism and communism, China seeks to maintain a balance between its nuanced historical identity and its aspirations as a global power.

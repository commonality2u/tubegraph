The culinary world is not just about food; it's a symphony of art, philosophy, service, and a deep personal connection to ingredients and nature. This article explores the personal journey and experiences of Anya Fernald, co-founder of Belcampo Farms, as she navigates through the landscapes of cooking and ethical farming.

## Anya Fernald's Beginnings

Anya Fernald's journey into the world of cooking began as a means to solve a problem within her family. Her mother's anxiety around meal times led Anya to dive into the kitchen to help manage the stress, discovering her knack for juggling multiple tasks at once. This practical approach evolved into a genuine love for cooking, driven by the influence of the tender and loving nature of the women cooks in her life, including her grandmother who cooked for church potlucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

## Culinary Philosophy: Art, Science, and Service

Fernald views cooking as both an art and a science, intertwined with service. For her, cooking is about creating beauty and responding creatively to each unique situation. It involves understanding the entire pipeline, from the sourcing of ingredients to the final presentation and the joy of savoring the meal. Anya emphasizes the service aspect as not only serving others but also enhancing health and the environment through food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Regenerative Farming Explained

Regenerative agriculture is akin to a return to traditional farming methods where the focus is on maintaining the health of the soil and ecosystem for future generations. This involves practices like adaptive grazing, which helps sequester carbon effectively. Regenerative farming combines human intelligence with technology to monitor and optimize grazing and land management, making it crucial to Anya's farming approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.

Central to Fernald's work at Belcampo is the humane treatment of animals. This involves allowing animals to graze naturally, live outdoors as much as the climate permits, and consume diets they have evolved to eat. This care extends to ensuring that their end of life is handled with respect and ethical practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:48">[00:53:48]</a>.

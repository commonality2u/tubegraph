## Introduction
The discourse around Libertarian and anarcho-capitalist policies is exemplified through the actions and philosophies of Javier Milei, the president of Argentina. Milei, renowned for his [Libertarian views on government and war](libertarian_views_on_government_and_war) and a self-described anarcho-capitalist, has initiated significant economic transformations in Argentina, emphasizing minimal government intervention and maximizing economic freedom.

## Milei's Economic Philosophy

### Ideological Foundations
Javier Milei identifies as an *anarcho-capitalist*, aspiring to minimize state intervention while advocating for individual freedom and market-driven policies. He draws inspiration from various economists and philosophers, including Murray Rothbard and Ludwig von Mises, whose works influenced his shift towards a Libertarian-anarchist philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

Milei describes liberalism as the "unrestricted respect for the life project of others based on the principle of non-aggression and in defense of the right to life, liberty, and property" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, aligning closely with thinkers like John Locke and Alberto Venegas Lynch.

### Market Anarchism to Minarchism
While ideologically an anarcho-capitalist, Milei acknowledges the practical challenges of achieving a stateless society. Thus, he implements policies as a *minarchist*, focusing on minimizing the size and influence of the state while dismantling over-regulation and inefficient government practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

## Implementing Anarchocapitalist Policies

### Economic Reforms in Argentina
Upon assuming office, Milei tackled Argentina’s severe economic crises—hyperinflation, mass unemployment, and national debt—through radical *free market* reforms. His achievements include achieving a fiscal surplus for the first time in 16 years, significantly reducing inflation, and laying off a large number of civil employees to cut down on government expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Deregulation and Fiscal Policies
Milei's administration established a deregulation ministry which aims to eliminate restrictive regulations every day. He promises to continue Argentina's path towards becoming "the freest country on the planet," with hundreds of structural reforms pending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

### Currency Competition
Milei supports a regime of currency competition instead of outright dollarization, advocating for a monetary system that allows free choice of currency, effectively promoting a competition of currencies guided by market demands rather than enforced national standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.

## Challenges and Criticisms

### Institutional Resistance
Milei’s Libertarian policies have faced significant resistance from the established political and economic institutions. He critiques the peronist party and other political entities for failing to embrace his reforms, often attributing criticism to vested interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:30">[00:21:30]</a>.

### Public Perception and Social Impact
While his policies aim at long-term prosperity, critics argue his methods could lead to short-term economic pain. Many Argentine citizens express fear over the potentially harsh social impacts of rapidly dismantling public institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>.

## Conclusion

Javier Milei's presidency is seen as a bold experiment in applying [[libertarianism_and_the_libertarian_party | Libertarian]] and anarcho-capitalist principles at a national scale. His focus on deregulation, economic freedom, and reducing the state's role aligns with the classical ideals of [[milton_friedman_and_ayn_rands_views_on_individual_freedom_and_capitalism | Milton Friedman and Ayn Rand]].

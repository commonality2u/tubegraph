## Early Life and Education

Fiona Hill was born in 1965 in a coal mining town in Northeast England, during a period of significant economic decline as the coal sector in Britain was diminishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Her father lost his job multiple times as every mine he worked in closed down, leaving the family struggling to find stability without qualifications for other types of work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This environment instilled in her a strong emphasis on education, viewed as the only path to a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Hill's interest in global affairs and Russia began early, triggered by geopolitical tensions such as the Euro Missile Crisis in the 1980s and the threat of nuclear conflict, which deeply impacted her teenage years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Encouraged by a family member, she decided to study Russian to understand global conflicts better, leading her to pursue education and career opportunities that would eventually align her with some of the significant moments in global politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

Hill went on to study Russian at university, strongly supported by scholarships tied to her mining community's ties with the miners of Donbass, Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Her career eventually took her to the United States, where she found opportunities in government service and academia, becoming a well-respected foreign policy expert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

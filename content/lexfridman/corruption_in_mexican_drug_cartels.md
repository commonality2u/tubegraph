The conversation with Ed Calderon, a security specialist who has worked extensively in the northern border region of Mexico, offers a deep insight into the pervasive corruption within the Mexican drug cartels and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Calderon's experiences reveal many layers of corruption, from the highest levels of political involvement down to the everyday cultural norms that facilitate systemic dishonesty.

## The Nature and Extent of Corruption

Calderon describes a pervasive culture where "anybody can be corrupted," indicating that no one is immune to the influence of organized crime, not even law enforcement officers who have undergone FBI background checks or polygraph tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This realization highlights a significant issue: even the most stringent security measures may fail when confronted with the cunning and coercive tactics of the cartel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Corruption in Mexico is painted as both "systemic and cultural," a reality ingrained from an early age. Calderon illustrates this by describing how parents bribe school directors to secure favorable educational arrangements for their children, a common practice in Mexican society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Such practices are driven by deep-seated distrust in the government and are often seen as survival mechanisms in an unstable environment.

## Corruption's Impact on Law Enforcement

The interplay between politics, law enforcement, and the cartels is riddled with betrayal and dishonesty. Political candidates in Mexico often receive backing from opposing cartel groups, leading to a high number of politically motivated assassinations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:07">[00:28:07]</a>. Corruption extends to the highest levels of government, as evidenced by figures like García Luna being on the take <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

The militarization of the drug war has further complicated law enforcement's role in Mexico. Initial hopes of transforming the police into a robust, American-style force were dashed when the trained units were misappropriated for paramilitary operations instead of community policing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.

## The Cartel's Hold Over Society

Cartels exercise a Robin Hood-like presence in many regions, engaging in activities like building roads, hospitals, and schools, which endears them to the local populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:19">[00:39:19]</a>. This behavior creates a dichotomy where cartels are both feared and revered, further complicating efforts to challenge their power.

Calderon notes that violence and trust go hand-in-hand within the cartels' framework. The cartels post gruesome acts and executions online as deliberate intimidation tactics, meant to enforce a culture of fear and maintain control over both their operations and territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## The Inescapable Web of Corruption

Many in law enforcement find themselves caught in a "box" due to the systemic nature of corruption. Leaving the force often results in joblessness, as many are deemed ineligible to join any other police organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Such policies contribute to a vicious cycle where those trained to combat crime are sometimes left with no choice but to engage in the very corruption they once fought against.

## Conclusion

Calderon's narrative uncovers the complex and omnipresent corruption within the Mexican drug cartels, highlighting a culture that is both a protector and predator of its people. His experiences provide a firsthand understanding of the challenges faced by those attempting to combat these powerful networks and reveal the deep-seated issues entrenched in Mexico’s social and political fabric.

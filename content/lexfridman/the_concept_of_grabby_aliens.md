The notion of "grabby aliens" emerges from the exploration of a unique conception of extraterrestrial civilizations that actively expand and visibly alter their environments in the universe. This article explores the key elements of this idea and its implications for our understanding of cosmic civilizations.

## Definition

Grabby aliens are civilizations that expand rapidly throughout the universe and impact their surroundings in significant, observable ways. The term was presented by Robin Hanson in a work titled "If Loud Aliens Explain Human Earliness, Quiet Aliens Are Also Rare" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The concept is analogous to the "big bang," implying a technical rather than casual term.

> Grabby aliens are defined by their fast expansion and the notable changes they implement in the universe. If they exist, their presence would be unmistakable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Characteristics

1. **Expansion and Visibility:**
   - Grabby aliens expand at significant speeds, presumably close to a third of the speed of light. This rapid expansion makes them detectable by the changes they cause in their environments, such as rearranging stars and restructuring galaxies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

2. **Competitive and Aggressive:**
   - These civilizations likely exist in competitive spaces where different parts compete for resources and dominance, akin to human civilizations altering landscapes on Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

3. **Mathematical Modeling:**
   - Hanson and his co-authors employ mathematical models, setting parameters to predict the distribution and expansion speed of grabby aliens. These models suggest that we should see many vast and active regions of the universe if such civilizations expand slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

## The Search and Implications

- The implications of grabby aliens carry significant weight in the search for extraterrestrial life. They propose a scenario where humans are among the early intelligent civilizations in the cosmic timeline due to the lack of observable grabby aliens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
  
- This existence model challenges the famous Fermi Paradox by providing a potential explanation: advanced civilizations become too spread out to detect with current technology unless they become grabby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

- Importantly, this model aligns with the [[search_for_alien_life | search for alien life]] by suggesting that if grabby aliens are numerous and expanding, they should be observable through their energetic and environmental footprint in the cosmos.

## Conclusion

Grabby aliens present a fascinating accoutrement, rationalizing why we may not yet have observed definitive signs of extraterrestrial intelligence. The notion invites us to reconsider our assumptions and models of otherworldly civilizations, potentially guiding future astronomical explorations and theoretical frameworks for understanding advanced life forms in the universe.

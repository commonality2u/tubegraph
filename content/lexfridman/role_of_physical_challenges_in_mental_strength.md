This intricate relationship can have lasting impacts on one's mental strength, overall well-being, and capacity for dealing with life's various challenges.

This cultivation comes from enduring experiences that test one's ability to persist despite discomfort or pain. Such encounters often reveal mental weaknesses, providing opportunities for introspection and growth.

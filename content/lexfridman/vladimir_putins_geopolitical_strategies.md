## Historical Context and Ideological Roots

Central to Putin's strategies is the historical context in which he operates. The collapse of the Soviet Union is seen by Putin as one of the great geopolitical tragedies of the 20th century. His view is deeply rooted in the loss of [great power status](https://www.lexman.net/wiki/putins_imperial_ambitions), and the perceived division of the Russian nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

### The Narrative of the Russian People

Putin has often articulated a vision of Russians, Ukrainians, and Belarusians as one people, reflecting a historical narrative popular in the pre-revolutionary period of the Russian Empire. This ideology underscores his approach to the post-Soviet space, aiming for a reintegration or at least a reassertion of influence over these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:48">[01:48:48]</a>.

## Geopolitical Moves

### The Ukraine Focus

Ukraine holds a pivotal place in [Putin's geopolitical ambitions](https://www.lexman.net/wiki/vladimir_putin_and_contemporary_russian_politics). The events of the Orange Revolution in 2004 and the Revolution of Dignity in 2013 marked crucial points where Ukraine decisively turned towards the West, defying Kremlin-centric integration efforts. The subsequent annexation of Crimea and the conflict in Donbas are manifestations of these strategic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:30">[01:29:30]</a>.

### Rejection of Western Influence

A significant aspect of Putin's strategy is his rejection of NATO's eastward expansion and Western political models, which he perceives as encroachments upon Russian sovereignty and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. This perspective aligns with his calls for a multi-polar world where Russia asserts itself as a major global player alongside the United States, China, and the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:09">[03:08:09]</a>.

## Strategic Alliances and Conflict

Putin's foreign policy also involves cultivating alliances with non-Western powers, notably China, reflecting a strategy reminiscent of Cold War alignments between Moscow and Beijing. This relationship has been pivotal in counterbalancing Western influence and reinforcing Russia's position in global geopolitical dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Vladimir Putin's geopolitical strategies are deeply informed by a historical legacy, a quest for restoring Russia's influential status, and the dynamics of post-Cold War international relations. His leadership style, rooted in a vision of a strong, united Russian nation, continues to shape the geopolitical landscape of Eastern Europe and beyond, prompting ongoing global analysis and debate.

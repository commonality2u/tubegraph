Artificial intelligence (AI) continues to shape and redefine various aspects of society, a theme explored in a conversation with Stephen Schwarzman, the CEO and co-founder of Blackstone. AI's potential to drive transformation in science, education, and global competitiveness is particularly notable.

## MIT's College of Computing

In 2018, Stephen Schwarzman donated $350 million to the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) to establish the new College of Computing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The purpose of this initiative is to foster interdisciplinary research and bold, revolutionary ideas in artificial intelligence, helping the United States maintain its competitive edge on the global stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This school is envisioned to become a beacon for AI research, addressing both the profound innovations AI can bring and the societal challenges it might pose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:43">[30:43]</a>.

## AI's Ethical Implications

Artificial intelligence presents unparalleled opportunities for scientific advancement, yet these advancements bring ethical considerations to the forefront. There's an essential need for balance between innovation and societal acceptance to prevent potential public backlash that could hinder progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:12">[35:12]</a>. MIT's College of Computing aims to serve as a global convener, integrating various stakeholders—from academia to government—to establish guidelines that ensure AI remains a force for good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:21">[36:21]</a>.

## Global Perspectives and AI

The global landscape of artificial intelligence is rapidly evolving, with different nations pursuing their unique strategies. For example, China is ambitiously integrating computer science education at all levels, preparing its population for a future dominated by technological prowess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:18">[47:18]</a>. This initiative poses a competitive challenge to the United States, necessitating a robust response to maintain leadership in AI research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:43">[50:43]</a>.

## AI and Governance

In terms of governance, achieving excellence in AI requires significant federal investment and a collaborative effort akin to a modern-day 'moonshot' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:11">[51:11]</a>. However, the political climate and fiscal constraints pose significant barriers, as substantial support from the government is crucial for staying at the forefront of technological advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:01">[52:01]</a>.

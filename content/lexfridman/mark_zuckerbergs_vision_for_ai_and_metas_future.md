## The Vision for AI at Meta

Zuckerberg envisions AI as an integral part of Meta's mission to connect people and foster human interaction. He emphasizes the role of AI in enhancing user experiences across platforms like Facebook, Instagram, and WhatsApp. The development of AI technologies such as large language models and image generation tools are set to revolutionize how users interact with digital platforms and each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

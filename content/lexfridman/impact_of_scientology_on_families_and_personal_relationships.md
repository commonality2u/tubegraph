The controversial practices and beliefs of [[scientologys_belief_system_and_practices | Scientology]] have profound impacts on families and personal relationships. The nature of these impacts is often intertwined with the organization's structure and control mechanisms, which dictate the lives of its followers in ways that can lead to familial separation and personal loss.

## The Auditing Experience and Personal Control

The core practice of Scientology, known as auditing, is said to be a form of one-on-one talk therapy that aims to improve a person's spiritual awareness and ability. However, as Aaron Smith-Levin, a former Scientologist, explains, auditing sessions are tightly controlled and can often delve into past-life recollections, creating an environment where personal information is scrutinized and retained by the organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>. This can result in a loss of personal autonomy, as members may feel that their private experiences are used against them.

## Familial Disconnections

One of the most controversial practices in Scientology is "disconnection," where members are often forced to sever ties with family members who are deemed "suppressive persons" or who criticize the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. This practice has led to heartbreaking separations within families, as individuals are made to choose between their faith and their loved ones. In Smith-Levin's own experience, his family's relationships were permanently fractured by such policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Emotional and Psychological Toll

The church's control over personal decisions can be extensive, dictating who members can associate with and even enforcing doctrines that impact one’s mental health. The mandated secrecy and information control within the church create an environment of isolation, which can exacerbate the [psychological control](the_personal_impact_of_belief_systems_and_psychological_control) experienced by members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## The Role of Leadership in Family Dynamics

Under the leadership of [[david_miscavige_and_the_leadership_of_scientology | David Miscavige]], these practices have only intensified. Miscavige’s strict interpretation and enforcement of church policy has contributed to the [destructive impact on families](impact_of_family_and_legacy) by prioritizing church allegiance over familial bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

The [[influence_and_controversies_surrounding_scientology | influence and controversies]] surrounding Scientology underscore the complex impact it has on its members’ personal lives. While some may find personal benefit from its practices, the broader narrative is one of strife and separation within families. The organization's policies, as enforced by its leadership, often demand loyalty to the church above all else, leading to profound personal and familial sacrifices.

The healthcare industry in the United States is riddled with complexities and inefficiencies, primarily due to its opaque nature, which breeds a lack of trust among consumers and professionals alike. One of the key players attempting to disrupt this system is Cost Plus Drugs, a company co-founded by [[Mark Cuban]], which aims to revolutionize drug pricing through transparency and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:54">[01:46:54]</a>.

## The Problems in the Healthcare System

One of the major issues in the current healthcare system is the lack of transparency. This lack leads to mistrust and uncertainty about the genuine cost of services and products, making it difficult for consumers to make informed decisions. The industry is also heavily controlled by large pharmacy benefit managers (PBMs) like CVS Caremark, Cigna's Express Scripts, and United Health's OptumRx, which prioritize profit over patient care and often work through non-transparent means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. 

These PBMs operate opaquely, preventing the disclosure of costs and pricing mechanisms between employers and drug manufacturers. Consequently, they maintain control over a majority of the market, essentially forming a cartel-like structure that limits competition and promotes inflated pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:55">[01:50:55]</a>.

## Introduction to Cost Plus Drugs

Cost Plus Drugs seeks to break the traditional mold of the pharmaceutical distribution system. The company aims to foster a transparent drug pricing model. When customers visit Cost Plus Drugs, they can see the actual cost that the company pays for drugs, followed by a modest 15% markup, a pharmacy fill fee, and shipping costs. This transparency is aimed at building trust with consumers, a stark contrast to the existing practices of PBMs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.

### The Business Model

Cost Plus Drugs operates outside the traditional PBM system. They provide drugs at a markup of just 15% of their cost price, compared to much higher markups by traditional PBMs. This pricing model initially began with the expectation that transparency would effectively generate consumer interest and engagement, and it has succeeded in precisely thatâ€”redefining market expectations and pressuring the industry to rethink its cost structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:39">[01:46:39]</a>.

### Challenges Encountered

The pharmaceutical industry is deeply entrenched with established practices and players, making it challenging for new entrants to break through. Cost Plus Drugs faces resistance from within the industry as major brands have threatened to delist companies for engaging with them, further complicating access to essential medications. Despite these hurdles, Cost Plus Drugs continues to push for industry reform by showcasing the extent of savings possible with a transparent model, thus fostering industry-wide change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## The Role of Employers and CEOs

Many CEOs have limited comprehension of the intricacies of healthcare coverage and its impact on their bottom lines. Recognizing this gap, Mark Cuban advocates for increased CEO involvement in healthcare decisions within their companies. Understanding healthcare costs and strategies can lead to substantial savings and improved healthcare outcomes for employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:48">[01:54:48]</a>.

### The Importance of a Healthcare CEO

Cuban suggests that companies, particularly those with significant employee bases, should consider appointing a healthcare CEO or executive to oversee and manage all healthcare-related activities. This role would focus on maximizing efficiencies, ensuring optimal employee healthcare outcomes, and eliminating unnecessary expenses tied to inefficient or outdated practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Potential for Industry Reform

Cost Plus Drugs is a beacon of hope in a convoluted industry. By promoting transparency and emphasizing trust, the company aims to set a new standard that could trigger broader reforms across the healthcare sector. The success of Cost Plus Drugs could encourage more companies to follow suit, leading to more transparent practices industry-wide and ultimately benefiting consumers by reducing costs and improving healthcare delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:56">[01:58:56]</a>.

Racism in the context of policing remains a pressing issue within the United States, deeply affecting African-American communities and shaping the experience of racial inequality in the country. This article delves into various aspects of this complex interaction, drawing from historical contexts and contemporary discussions.

## Historical Context

Historically, African-Americans have suffered from what can be termed as under-protection by the law. In the Antebellum period, for instance, there was often no recognized crime of murdering a black person in many of the areas where the majority of African-Americans resided, particularly in the slave states. In those instances, a black person was seen merely as property, and any harm inflicted was considered a tort rather than a crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:01">[01:31:01]</a>.

After the abolition of slavery, lynching became a prevalent form of racial terror with little to no legal recourse taken against perpetrators, again showcasing a systemic under-protection by the law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## Contemporary Issues

In modern times, one of the central grievances within African-American communities relates to both under-protection and over-policing. The famous Kerner Commission report of 1968 highlighted complaints about inadequate police protection in minority neighborhoods, leaving communities vulnerable to crime without sufficient law enforcement intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:40">[01:33:40]</a>.

Conversely, there is also the issue of racial profiling and discriminatory policing practices. African-Americans frequently face heightened scrutiny and suspicion, leading to a disproportionate number of stops and searches without just cause. This can result in escalated encounters, breeding mistrust and further alienation between the community and law enforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:37">[01:36:37]</a>.

Randall Kennedy, a professor at Harvard Law School, points to the attitude of the police, which often conveys contempt and animus towards young black men, reflecting a broader societal contempt that perpetuates racial biases in policing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>.

## The Role of Law Enforcement

Police are some of the most consequential state agents due to the authority they hold, including their legal mandate to use force. This power dynamic means that the stakes are particularly high in cases of racial bias and policing, making transparency and accountability imperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:49">[01:44:49]</a>.

## Moving Forward: Accountability and Transparency

The lack of accountability in policing is one of the key challenges to addressing [racism and inequality in the criminal justice system](02:46:07). Randall Kennedy argues that police should be held accountable to foster trust and ensure justice. This involves a call for structural changes within police departments to enhance transparency and address misconduct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>.

## The Broader Context

It's important to recognize that racism in policing is tied to broader social and political dynamics, including [critical race theory and public discourse](01:27:57), as well as ongoing conversations about [race and affirmative action in education](02:24:02) and [political discourse and division in the US](03:07:08). Addressing these systemic issues requires a comprehensive approach that includes policy reform, education, and community engagement.

Racism in policing is not only a matter of public policy but also one of profound social justice, necessitating ongoing dialogue, commitment to reform, and active efforts to dismantle racial biases within law enforcement and the broader societal framework.

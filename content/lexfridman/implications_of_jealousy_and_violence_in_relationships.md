Jealousy and violence are complex emotions and behaviors that have significant implications in romantic relationships. These aspects can impact the dynamics of a relationship profoundly, affecting both mental and physical well-being of the individuals involved.

## Jealousy: A Feature or a Bug?

Jealousy is a common emotional response in relationships and can act as both a protective mechanism and a destructive force.

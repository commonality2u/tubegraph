## Introduction

The neocortex is a critical component of the human brain, accounting for about 75% of its total volume. It is not only pivotal in intelligence but also in various high-level functions such as vision, hearing, and language processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00">[32:00]</a>. This intricate structure has intrigued scientists for decades and has been central to understanding human intelligence—a journey significantly furthered by the work of neuroscientist Jeff Hawkins.

## Neocortex: Structure and Function

The neocortex is structured as a six-layered sheet of neural tissue that is highly folded and organized. This organization allows for complex processing and integration of information, which is essential for functions like perception, cognition, and voluntary motor control. The neocortex operates on a repetitive algorithm, acting as a universal processor that applies the same basic principles across a multitude of cognitive tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>.

> The neocortex is a central part of understanding how intelligence works, as it dominates our brain's structure in terms of volume. All high-level cognitive functions such as language, planning, and abstraction are processed here. Understanding this part of the brain is integral to revealing the nature of human intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:00">[32:00]</a>.

## The Thousand Brains Theory of Intelligence

Jeff Hawkins' *A Thousand Brains*, presents the groundbreaking [[thousand_brains_theory_of_intelligence]], which suggests that the neocortex consists of thousands of separate, smaller modeling systems that collectively form a full model of perception and understanding. According to this theory, each neocortical column operates somewhat independently yet collaboratively through a process of voting and consensus to achieve integrated perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05">[10:05]</a>.

### Distributed Intelligence

The Thousand Brains Theory posits a distributed model of intelligence, wherein each column is a complete system capable of learning and perception. This distribution allows the human brain to maintain function even if portions are damaged—demonstrating the robustness and flexibility that characterize the neocortex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:10">[27:10]</a>.

## Understanding Intelligence and Prediction

Hawkins emphasizes that intelligence is fundamentally about constructing and using models to make predictions about the world. These predictions, which are a continuous and integral part of brain function, are not just about what is likely to happen next but serve as a mechanism for learning. When a prediction fails, it provides an opportunity to revise the underlying model—the crux of intelligent adaptation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:47">[16:47]</a>.

## The Evolutionary Perspective

Discussing the [[evolutionary_origins_of_intelligence]], Hawkins provided insights into how complex neural structures like the neocortex may have evolved to support the vast cognitive capabilities seen in humans today. The evolutionary advantage of intelligence was closely linked to mobility and interaction with diverse environments, leading to the development of brain structures capable of processing and modeling varied sensory inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:35">[24:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

Jeff Hawkins' exploration of the neocortex presents a compelling narrative about its central role in human intelligence. By understanding its structure and function through theories like the Thousand Brains, researchers can better understand how intelligence operates—not only in humans but potentially in artificial systems designed to emulate this complex biology. As science progresses, further demystifying the [[neocortex_and_intelligence]], it stands as a beacon guiding us towards comprehensive knowledge of human cognition and the development of sophisticated [[computation_and_intelligence | artificial intelligence systems]].

In summary, the neocortex isn't just a structure within the brain—it's a fundamental element that encapsulates the essence of human intelligence and adaptability.

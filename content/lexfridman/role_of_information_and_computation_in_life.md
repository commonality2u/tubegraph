The nature of life and its origins has been a profound topic of inquiry, engaging the minds of researchers across various disciplines. At the heart of this inquiry lies the intricate relationship between information, computation, and life itself. This article delves into how these concepts interplay and contribute to our understanding of life, inspired by a conversation with Sarah Walker, a theoretical physicist and astrobiologist.

## Understanding Life Through Information and Computation

Information plays a crucial role in what life is and how it operates. The traditional view sees life as a self-reproducing chemical system capable of Darwinian evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. This perspective emphasizes the genetic information encoded in DNA and RNA, which allows for inheritance and evolution through the process of natural selection.

However, Walker suggests that understanding life requires a broader view of information—not just as genetic sequences but as a fundamental aspect of the universe that interacts with physical systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. This leads to the proposition that deeper laws govern living systems through the interaction of information with matter.

### The Role of Computation

Walker and others propose that life might be understood better by considering it through the lens of computation. This involves looking at how simple rules applied to initial conditions can generate complex behaviors, akin to what is observed in cellular automata. These computational systems demonstrate how complexity, resembling lifelike structures, can emerge from simple patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>.

However, she argues that the classical physics view—that everything follows from static laws of motion given an initial condition—may not be sufficient for biology. Instead, biological systems might be governed by rules that depend on their current state and evolve over time, aligning more closely with computational systems where the state of the machine influences the update rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:12">[00:32:12]</a>.

## Information as a Creative Force in the Universe

One of the profound ideas explored is the notion that life is not just about survival or replication, but about creativity and the generation of new possibilities. Walker notes that imagination and creativity are integral to life and are facilitated by the unique interplay of information and causation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

### Implications for Searching for Life

In seeking extraterrestrial life, Walker suggests moving beyond traditional chemical signatures and instead looking for high assembly objects, which require a significant causal history to exist. This involves examining the complexity and information required to form such objects, as they suggest a higher likelihood of being products of a living process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:03">[01:10:03]</a>.

## Unified Framework for Life and Intelligence

Ultimately, understanding life through information and computation may lead to a unified framework that also includes [[relationship_between_computing_and_physical_sciences | physical sciences]], such as [[computation_and_intelligence | computation and intelligence]] and possibly even consciousness. This broader perspective could pave the way toward a comprehensive theory that encompasses not only the nature of life as we know it but also the broader existential questions about our place in the universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

The role of information and computation in life fundamentally challenges our understanding of living systems, offering new avenues for exploration in both biological and artificial realms.

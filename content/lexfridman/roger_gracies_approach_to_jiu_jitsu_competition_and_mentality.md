Roger Gracie is revered for his extraordinary achievements in the world of [[jiu_jitsu_and_submission_grappling | Jiu Jitsu]]. His approach to competition and the mentality he brings to it have contributed significantly to his success.

## Philosophy and Mentality

Roger Gracie's philosophy towards Jiu Jitsu competition revolves around the belief that winning is not sufficient unless accompanied by a submission victory. In Gracie's view, the goal is to submit opponents, thereby leaving no question about who the better competitor is. This approach underscores a desire for total domination rather than merely accruing points during a match:

> "Winning is not enough. I have to submit them. That's the only way to prove I'm the best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:06">[02:48:06]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of self-belief, persistence, and learning from every match, whether it's a victory or a loss. For Gracie, self-belief is intrinsic:

> "I never really doubted myself... Determination is the most important thing you need to know where you're going" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Preparation and Training

Gracie’s approach to preparation for competitions involves intense focus on the fundamentals and continuous refinement of techniques. He has famously honed his skills through training with lower-rank students, a strategy that may appear counterintuitive. However, this has helped him to sharpen his skills more effectively because these practitioners often present unique defensive challenges due to their unpredictable styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:48">[02:24:48]</a>.

Gracie values the importance of practicing weaknesses and continually developing his game. He believes that the true learning occurs in the presence of resistance: 

> "Once you know the mechanics, you have to practice with resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:06">[02:40:06]</a>.

### Training Mental Focus

Mental preparation for a competition begins long before stepping onto the mat. Gracie talks about clearing his mind, focusing, and maintaining a calm demeanor. He emphasizes the importance of starting to focus before the competition begins, engaging in a process he likens to entering a state of "blankness" or calm darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Handling Pressure

Gracie is well-known for his ability to handle the immense pressure of high-stakes matches. When he faced Marcus 'Buchecha' Almeida, one of the top competitors at the time, Gracie's nerves were especially heightened due to the match's significance. Despite acknowledging the pressure, he remained confident, driven by past experiences and a strong belief in his abilities:

> "I was a lot more confident than fearful... I was pretty confident that I could beat him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

It's this ability to maintain confidence and composure that has played a crucial role in Gracie’s success on the global stage.

## Reflections on Losses and Growth

Despite his immense success, Gracie does not shy away from discussing defeats and their role in his career. He views every defeat as an opportunity to learn and improve, consistently returning with renewed determination to excel and overcome the challenges posed by his opponents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:58">[02:56:58]</a>.

## Legacy and Advice

Gracie's journey from being a young, chubby kid to the pinnacle of Jiu Jitsu excellence serves as a beacon for others. He stresses the importance of self-determination, surrounding oneself with excellence, and continuously pushing past failures. His advice to young competitors is to remain determined, embrace failures as learning opportunities, and not be deterred by the skepticism of others:

> "Surround yourself with great people... know where you want to go, and be sure that you will fail many times" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:32">[02:49:32]</a>.

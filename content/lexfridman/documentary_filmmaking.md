## Key Aspects of Documentary Filmmaking

### 1. **Story and Subject Matter**

The choice of story is crucial in documentary filmmaking. Skye Fitzgerald speaks of his "so what threshold," indicating that a documentary must address a topic of genuine importance and potential impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a>. The subjects of his documentaries, like the medical crises and humanitarian efforts in war-ravaged regions, reflect a conscious choice to illuminate urgent and often overlooked issues.

### 2. **Gaining Access and Building Trust**

One of the profound challenges in documentary filmmaking is gaining access to the locations and individuals integral to the story. Fitzgerald emphasizes the importance of developing relationships and trust with those you film. This involves ongoing dialogue and respecting participants as collaborators, not subjects, to ensure genuine and respectful representation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.

### 3. **Documentary Ethics and Responsibilities**

The ethical responsibility in documentary filmmaking extends beyond just capturing reality. Documentary filmmakers often grapple with decisions such as when to intervene during filming. For Fitzgerald, there was a moment in filming *Lifeboat* when he chose to put down the camera to help save someone from drowning, underscoring his belief in being a human first, filmmaker second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:02">[01:56:02]</a>.

### 4. **The Role of Technology and Craftsmanship**

Though not a self-described "tech geek," Fitzgerald identifies the necessity of having the right tools to visually capture a story. In his approach, access dictates filming logistics, which often means working with small, nimble equipment to maintain the intimate nature of documentary storytelling without intrusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:13">[01:00:13]</a>.

### 5. **Editing: The Final Creation**

Documentary filmmaking is iterative and involves multiple creationsâ€”from initial concepts, through real-time adjustments during filming, to the final narrative crafted in the editing room. Skye Fitzgerald outlines his "three creations" process, emphasizing the transformation of the film from its original vision to the final product based on what is actually captured on camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

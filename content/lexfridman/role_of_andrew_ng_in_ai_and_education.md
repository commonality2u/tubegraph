Andrew Ng is a prominent figure in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), renowned for his extensive contributions as an educator, researcher, and innovator. His efforts have significantly shaped the landscape of AI and education, impacting millions worldwide. This article outlines his major achievements and their influence on AI and education.

## Early Life and Interest in Computer Science

Andrew Ng's journey into computer science began in his childhood when he grew up in Hong Kong and Singapore. He started learning to code at the age of five or six, initially using the BASIC programming language. He was fascinated by the ability to write code, leading to the creation and playing of simple games on his computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. His interest expanded further during his teenage years when his father, a doctor, introduced him to expert systems and neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Educational Impact and Coursera

Andrew Ng is perhaps best known for co-founding Coursera, a platform that has popularized the concept of MOOCs (massive open online courses) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. His course on machine learning at Stanford University was among the first to be put online, leading to the education of millions of students globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

Donald Trump, the 45th President of the United States, has been a transformative figure in American politics. His influence extends across the Republican Party and continues to shape the political landscape in the United States.

## Transforming the Republican Party

Donald Trump's ascent to power marked a significant shift within the Republican Party. He disrupted the existing power structures and norms by challenging the status quo and opposing many of the established figures within the party, such as the Bushes and Mitt Romney. Trump demonstrated that a willingness to upset the traditional order could lead to success and influence within the party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Trump's Communication Style

One of Trump's key strategies has been his mastery of attention as a political currency. The Democrats, according to some, still believe that money is the primary currency of politics, whereas Trump has shown that garnering attention is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. He utilizes social media and thrives on a constant engagement with both supporters and critics, often leaning into conflict as a means of maintaining control of the political agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>.

## Tariffs and Economic Control

Trump's economic strategy has been characterized by his use of tariffs, which have functioned as a form of leverage in international negotiations. The tariffs have been seen as a way to exert executive control and address trade imbalances without the need for congressional approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:50">[02:37:50]</a>. While controversial, this approach highlights Trump's preference for direct, executive-led interventions in economic policy.

## Centralizing Power and Political Leverage

Trump believes in consolidating power and has sought to centralize authority within the government's executive branch. This approach also extends to his influence over Congress, where he has effectively communicated to Republican members that aligning with him is necessary to retain political support and avoid primary challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:23">[02:21:23]</a>. This creates a political environment where loyalty to Trump supersedes traditional policy stances.

## Criticisms of Trump's Approach

While many laud Trump's approach for its effectiveness in maintaining control and pushing forward his agenda, critics express concern over the potential erosion of democratic norms and checks and balances. Trump's administration has faced accusations of disregarding established procedures and of fostering an environment where power is overly centralized and wielded unilaterally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:26">[02:22:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

Donald's Trump political strategies have undeniably reshaped American politics. His emphasis on attention, his use of tariffs, and his efforts to consolidate power have had lasting impacts. Whether these strategies will continue to wield influence remains a subject of debate, but their effects on the political environment are profound and far-reaching.

Bert Kreischer, a well-known [[standup_comedy_and_podcasting | stand-up comedian, podcaster, and actor]], offers a unique perspective on [[comedy_as_an_art_form | comedy]] through his influences and experiences. His journey through comedy is marked by inspirations from both historical figures and iconic comedians, contributing significantly to his storytelling and comedic style.

## Historical Influences

Bert Kreischer draws comedic inspiration from historical figures such as Winston Churchill and literary icons like Ernest Hemingway, whose simplicity in writing resonated with him. Kreischer admired Hemingway for his concise writing style, which was accessible despite Kreischer's mild dyslexia. Hemingway's famous quote, "Write drunk, edit sober," reflects an approach that Kreischer identifies with in his comedy – the idea that initial drafts are always imperfect but full of potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Comedic Inspirations

Kreischer's comedic style is heavily influenced by legendary comedians, including Dave Attell and [[Louis C.K.]], who recognized the purity of simple, spontaneous jokes. An example of this was a joke about his daughter not understanding how they found out where a deaf child lived, which Louis CK appreciated for its simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. His preference for raw, unrefined humor over polished routines can also be seen in his admiration for [[Norm MacDonald]] and Mitch Hedberg, masters of delivering punchlines with an organic feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Personal Experiences and Comedy

Kreischer found his stride in comedy after a transformative experience during a trip to Russia. His interactions with stoic locals highlighted the power of humor to bridge cultural divides, which later informed his [[standup_comedy_and_its_impact_on_society | comedic narratives]] like "The Machine" story. This anecdote illustrates not only a wild adventure but a pivotal moment that tied Kreischer’s comedic identity to a specific life event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Additionally, Kreischer's college years were formative; he embraced a more serious persona before realizing his genuine humor lay in being himself – a journey of self-discovery that many comedians undertake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:04">[01:36:04]</a>.

## The Role of Humor and Joy

For Kreischer, humor serves as a conduit for joy – an essential element of his performances and public persona. This inherent joy of performing and engaging audiences is part of what makes comedy fulfilling for him. His pursuit of joy in life and on-stage aligns with Hunter S. Thompson’s philosophy of living life to the fullest and reveling in the ensuing chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:27">[02:07:27]</a>.

Bert Kreischer’s comedy is a blend of historical reverence and modern inspiration, making it unique and resonant with audiences seeking authentic and relatable humor. With influences from cultural icons and his own life experiences, Kreischer continues to shape his comedic legacy in meaningful ways.

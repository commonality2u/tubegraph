Realism in international relations is a foundational theory that presents a rather pragmatic view of global politics, emphasizing the role of power and the anarchic nature of the international system. Predominantly associated with the thoughts of Thomas Hobbes, this perspective sees international relations as a realm where no overarching authority exists, compelling states to prioritize their survival and security.

## Core Principles of Realism

1. **Anarchic International System**: In realism, the international system is considered anarchic, meaning there is no central authority above states. The absence of a higher power means states operate like independent actors in a Hobbesian state of nature, constantly wary of threats from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

2. **State Survival as a Primary Goal**: Realism posits that the primary objective of states is to ensure their own survival. Given the anarchic nature of the international arena, states are driven by a self-help mentality, emphasizing the accumulation of power as a buffer against threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

3. **Power as the Currency of International Relations**: Power is the key to survival in realism. It is not only defined by military might but also by the economic wealth and population size of a state, which collectively reinforce military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Realism's View on Power Dynamics

Realists argue that states are inherently engaged in a constant struggle for power to protect their interests and ensure their security. The drive to gain more power often leads to security dilemmas where the actions by a state to strengthen its security can lead to increased tensions and potential conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Realism distinguishes itself through its cautious perspective on international interactions. Realists are skeptical of idealistic notions such as perpetual peace and tend to view states as rational actors that pursue policies favorable to their power interests, whether through alliances or deterrence strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Offensive vs. Defensive Realism

Within realism, there are subdivisions such as offensive and defensive realism. Offensive realists believe that states should maximize their power and strive to become regional hegemons to secure their survival. Conversely, defensive realists argue that aggressive expansion often backfires, leading to balancing counteractions by other states and reducing collective security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a>.

## Liberal and Realist Tensions

There's a significant theoretical divide between realism and liberalism in international relations. Liberals hold that cooperation can emerge through democratic frameworks, economic interdependence, and international institutions fostering peace. Realists, however, remain skeptical, positing that these arrangements are fragile and ultimately fettered by states' inherent focus on power and survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

Realism in international relations underscores the enduring and competitive nature of global politics. Through its emphasis on power, state behavior, and systemic anarchy, realism offers a lens that, while at times cynical, provides valuable insights into the continuous and complex interplay of international forces. The discourse surrounding realism remains relevant and contested, especially in contemporary discussions about global order, security, and [[us_foreign_policy_and_international_relations]].

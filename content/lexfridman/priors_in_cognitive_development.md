Understanding cognitive development involves exploring the foundational principles that shape the human mind's learning processes. A critical concept in this domain is the idea of *priors*. Priors are ingrained knowledge systems or intuitively held beliefs that influence how individuals, particularly humans, perceive and interact with the world. They play a vital role in enabling learning and adapting to new experiences, forming an essential aspect of both human cognition and artificial intelligence research.

## Core Knowledge Theories

Elizabeth Spelke from Harvard has significantly contributed to our understanding of these foundational priors through her core knowledge theory. This theory identifies specific domains of knowledge that are either inherent at birth or acquired very early in development due to pre-established neural predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

### Objectness

One of the primary priors is the concept of *objectness*. This refers to the innate ability to perceive and categorize environmental elements as distinct objects that adhere to basic physical laws like movement continuity and inertia. Babies, for example, have an intuitive understanding of objects as coherent entities that move as a whole and maintain their independence from other objects when they come into contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:10">[01:39:10]</a>.

### Agentness

*Agentness*, though not a dictionary-defined term, highlights another core prior. It denotes the capacity to recognize agents as objects with goals and who can act toward achieving those goals. This understanding allows individuals, even infants, to discern intentional motion and purpose in the actions of others, playing a crucial role in social cognition and interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:41">[01:40:41]</a>.

### Geometry and Topology

Humans also have innate geometric and topological knowledge, facilitating navigation and spatial awareness. This includes understanding distances, shapes, and the ability to traverse environments, supported by specific neural structures like grid cells and place cells in the hippocampus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:57">[01:40:57]</a>.

### Numeracy

Basic numeracy is another prior that suggests humans are naturally equipped to perform elementary counting and to assess quantities. While advanced mathematical abilities are learned, the rudimentary sense of numbers forms a part of our innate cognitive toolkit, allowing us to compare quantities and recognize numeric differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:21">[01:42:21]</a>.

## Implications for Artificial Intelligence

Acknowledging these priors in cognitive models can inform AI development, particularly in creating systems that emulate human-like learning and adaptability. When designing tests or tasks for AI, such as the ARC (Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus) challenge, it's crucial to ensure that the tasks are based on these fundamental priors and do not rely on specific external knowledge, like language or cultural references <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:16">[01:45:16]</a>.

## Conclusion

The study of priors in cognitive development not only enhances our understanding of human learning but also guides the creation of more nuanced and capable artificial systems. By modeling AI after the inherent cognitive abilities of humans, we can progress towards machines that mirror the flexibility and generalization capabilities of human intelligence. Understanding and leveraging priors are crucial steps in evolving both areas, providing a bridge between psychology and AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.

Scientific publishing is critical for the dissemination of new research findings and knowledge among researchers worldwide. However, the current landscape of scientific publishing faces numerous challenges that hinder the accessibility and impact of research outputs. This article explores some of these challenges, with insights from a conversation between Lex Friedman, Luiz, and Joao Batala, co-founders of Fermat's Library, a platform for annotating scientific papers.

## 1. Accessibility and Paywalls

A significant challenge in scientific publishing is the limited accessibility of research articles due to paywalls. More than 70% of published research articles are behind a paywall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This means that the public, including researchers in less affluent institutions and countries, cannot access a substantial portion of scientific knowledge without significant financial barriers.

### [!info] Who Is Responsible?
> The paywalls are not set by the funders of the research, such as government or industry, but by the journals themselves. These journals use unpaid labor from researchers for the peer review process, raising questions about where the money collected from paywalls goes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## 2. The Business Model of Journals

The current business model of scientific journals positions them as a costly middleman that does not substantially add value to the dissemination process. Authors submit their work for free, reviewers evaluate work for free, and institutions, often government-funded, purchase access back for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. This situation is described as a bizarre cycle where governments fund the entire process multiple times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

## 3. Impact Metrics and Academic Pressure

The pressure to publish in high-impact journals contributes to the perpetuation of suboptimal publishing practices. Young researchers in academia face intense pressure to publish in journals with high impact factors to secure funding and career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. This often results in a "publish or perish" culture where quantity is prioritized over quality.

### Problematic Metrics
> The impact factor, a metric for journal quality, can lead to gamification where researchers strive to publish in high-impact journals primarily for prestige, often at the expense of scientific integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>.

## 4. Lack of Open Access

Despite the digital age's potential for widespread dissemination of knowledge, only a small fraction of research is shared openly prior to journal publication. For instance, only 2% of biology papers appear first as preprints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:56">[00:29:56]</a>. Closed access further delays the communication of scientific ideas, and while fields like machine learning make better use of preprints, many areas lag behind significantly.

## 5. Peer Review Process

The traditional peer review process is another challenge facing scientific publishing. This process is often opaque, with decisions made by a small number of reviewers who may not represent the wider scientific community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>. The anonymity and lack of accountability may result in less rigorous and biased reviews.

## Conclusion

In summary, the landscape of scientific publishing is fraught with challenges that limit accessibility, foster a counterproductive culture of impact metrics, and perpetuate outdated dissemination practices. Moving towards an open-access model, reforming impact metrics, and exploring innovative peer review processes could contribute significantly to addressing these challenges. As platforms like Fermat's Library and open archives like [[scientific_dissemination_and_open_access | arXiv]] evolve, the potential for more democratic and accessible scientific publishing becomes increasingly attainable.

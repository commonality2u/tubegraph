In a recent conversation on the Lex Fridman podcast, [[michael_malices_anarchist_political_philosophy | Michael Malice]] offered his insights into the profound themes of beauty and hope, exploring the intersection of aesthetics and optimism as potential saviors of the world. Citing an evocative line from Fyodor Dostoevsky's "The Idiot," Malice unpacked what it means to believe that "[beauty will save the world](https://youtu.be/TT0oF0Fghb8?t=38)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Beauty as a Source of Hope

Michael Malice expressed a deep belief that beauty is intrinsically linked to hope. He argued that encountering beauty, even fleetingly, disrupts cynicism and hopelessness. The existence of beauty, whether in art, music, or natural perfection, offers a promise that such perfection can be realized again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

Malice mentioned the Platonic theory of forms, suggesting that the presence of beauty and perfection on Earth indicates that such ideals can and do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This philosophical stance asserts that beauty doesn't just inspire; it offers a tangible proof of concept, verifying that perfection is attainable.

## The Role of Beauty in Society

Expanding on beauty, Malice highlighted its broad scope beyond aesthetics. He considered beauty in the art of living, in music, and in moments of awe, like stargazing or witnessing scientific marvels such as rockets launching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. For Malice, beauty is not only about what pleases the eye but also about what stirs the soul.

## Truth, Goodness, and Beauty

In conversation, the dichotomy between truth, goodness, and beauty was explored, with Malice suggesting a philosophical overlap among these concepts. He argued that truth is sometimes overrated, proposing that a compelling narrative does not always need to be factually true to be transformative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Instead, goodness might be the cornerstone, providing meaning and fulfillment in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

Malice stated, "if you don't appreciate goodness, then beauty is just empty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Thus, while beauty might save the world, it does so in conjunction with goodness, forming a foundation for societal and personal values.

## The Interconnection of Optimism and Beauty

Central to Malice's discussion was the theme of optimism, a persistent undercurrent in his philosophy. As he discussed beauty, it became clear that optimism and the celebration of beauty are intertwined. This notion aligns with his broader views on the importance of maintaining hope, even amidst challenging times. The presence of beauty confirms future possibilities for joyous experiences and serves as a reminder of the world's potential to achieve perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Overall, Michael Malice's perspective on beauty and hope challenges the cynicism prevalent in society. By redefining beauty as a broader concept linked to personal and societal redemption, Malice portrays it as an essential element of human experience, capable of fostering [[the_role_of_optimism_and_art_in_shaping_the_future|the optimism necessary to shape a brighter future]].

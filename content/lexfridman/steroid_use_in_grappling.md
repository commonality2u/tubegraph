Steroid use in grappling has become a topic of considerable discourse, especially given the lack of standardized testing in many grappling competitions. This absence of testing has led to widespread speculation about the extent of steroid use among competitive grapplers and the impact it may have on the sport.

## Prevalence and Perception

In the grappling community, there's a prevailing belief that many top athletes might be using steroids due to the lack of testing in most competitions. According to Craig Jones, in organizations like ADCC where testing is not conducted, it is assumed that a significant number of competitors might be using performance-enhancing drugs. He humorously adds that they might be tested to ensure they are on steroids to maintain the level of spectacle expected in high-profile events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:06">[01:51:06]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethics of steroid use in sports without standardized testing are debated. While some argue that using steroids in these conditions levels the playing field, others maintain that it still constitutes cheating. Jones highlights the potential health risks, emphasizing how excessive steroid use could lead to early death, even if it results in short-term gains such as winning championships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:28">[00:52:28]</a>.

## Impact on Training

Steroids are believed to aid in recovery, allowing athletes to train more intensively and frequently. This can be particularly advantageous in a sport like grappling, where recovery from intense sessions is crucial. Nikki Ryan points out that one of the benefits of steroids is that they may allow athletes to train more without the stringent attention to diet and sleep that would otherwise be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:53">[00:56:53]</a>.

However, Craig Jones argues that reliance on steroids can lead to a detriment in technique, as athletes might begin to rely on their increased strength over technical skill, potentially leading to poorer performance in competition due to overusing muscles they have not previously relied on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:57">[00:57:57]</a>.

## Controversy and Rivalries

The discourse on steroid use is also fueled by personal rivalries within the sport. Notably, the exchanges between grapplers like Gordon Ryan and Nicky Rodriguez have brought allegations of steroid use to the public eye, where accusations are often part of broader trash-talking strategies to unsettle opponents ahead of competitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:30">[01:58:30]</a>.

## The Role of Natural Athletes

Despite the allegations and assumptions regarding steroid use, the grappling community does include natural athletes who advocate for steroid-free competition. Nikki Rodriguez, who has been vocal about accusations of him using steroids, points to ongoing efforts to prove his natural athlete status through public discussions and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

As grappling continues to grow both in competitiveness and commercial appeal, the conversation around steroid use is likely to persist. With varied opinions on its impact and ethical standing, it might take the introduction of formal testing and regulation to provide clear boundaries and ensure fairness within the sport. The grappling community remains divided, with some calling for stricter regulations and transparency, and others viewing it as an unavoidable aspect of modern competitive sports.

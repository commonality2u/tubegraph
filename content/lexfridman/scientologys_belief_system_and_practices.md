**Scientology** is a belief system created by L. Ron Hubbard. It fundamentally posits that humans are immortal spiritual beings called thetans, possessing native, God-like potential. Scientology teaches that thetans, through various decisions over time, have fallen from their original state of God-like power, becoming trapped in physical bodies on Earth, in what they refer to as a "prison planet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Core Beliefs of Scientology

Scientology's core beliefs can be summarized by three fundamental truths:

1. **Immortality** - Man is seen as an immortal spiritual being, known as a thetan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.
2. **Experience Beyond Life** - Human experience extends well beyond a single lifetime, suggesting the existence of past lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.
3. **Unlimited Potential** - A thetan's capabilities are seen as unlimited, though not currently realized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

## Scientology's Structure and Methods

Scientology is known for its structured approach to spiritual enlightenment, which it describes as the Bridge to Total Freedom. This includes a series of auditing processes using an E-meter, a device claimed to measure electrical resistance and help identify spiritual issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.

### Auditing
Auditing is a central practice within Scientology, resembling one-on-one talk therapy facilitated by an auditor. It involves recalling and confronting past traumas and engrams (recorded moments of pain and unconsciousness) with the goal of erasing them. Auditing is said to help individuals become more aware of their spiritual selves and improve their life situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:56">[00:50:56]</a>.

### The E-meter
The E-meter is considered an essential tool in auditing sessions. It is believed to provide feedback on spiritual issues through its readings, directing the course of the auditing session <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:43">[00:32:43]</a>.

### Operating Thetan (OT) Levels
After achieving the status of "Clear" — a state where a person is free of their reactive mind — a Scientologist can advance to higher confidential levels known as OT levels. These levels involve auditing away body thetans, believed to be separate thetans attached to the body, a byproduct of the catastrophic historical event involving Xenu, an intergalactic ruler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

## Philosophy of Ethics
In Scientology, ethics revolve around the concept of survival across eight dynamics, including the self, family, groups, mankind, and the universe at large. Ethical behavior is considered "pro-survival" and anything good for Scientology is inherently good for all dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Observations and Criticisms

While Scientology offers a structured belief system aimed at spiritual enlightenment, its practices and organizational structure have been subject to significant controversy. Notably, issues such as secrecy, alleged coercive practices, and the influence wielded by leaders like [[david_miscavige_and_the_leadership_of_scientology | David Miscavige]] have drawn scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

> [!info] Note on Secrecy
> The higher echelons of Scientology, including advanced OT levels, are considered confidential and inaccessible to most, contributing to the organization's secretive reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

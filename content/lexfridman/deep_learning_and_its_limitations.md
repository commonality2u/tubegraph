Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that has driven remarkable advancements in artificial intelligence. However, despite its groundbreaking capabilities, there are certain limitations inherent in deep learning models.

## Engineering vs. Science of Intelligence

In a [discussion with Vladimir Vapnik](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>), the difference between engineering intelligence and the science of intelligence was explored. Engineering focuses on creating devices that mimic human behavior without necessarily understanding the underlying mechanisms of intelligence. This distinction highlights a significant limitation in deep learning: while it can build systems that perform intelligent tasks, it often lacks the depth of understanding of intelligent processes.

## Imitation vs. Understanding

The conversation further delves into the concept of imitation in learning systems. Vapnik suggests that learning systems often imitate intelligence rather than understand it, emphasizing the challenge in bridging the gap between mimicking and comprehending complex cognitive functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

## The Role of Predicates

A significant aspect of understanding limitations in deep learning is the discussion around predicates, which are fundamental units of knowledge or behavior that can explain complex actions. Vapnik points out the difficulty in automatically discovering effective predicates, posing a barrier to a truly intelligent system. He notes that there might only be a limited number of predicates that are truly useful in describing real-world situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.

## The Extent of Generalization

One of the ongoing challenges in deep learning, covered extensively by Vapnik, is the issue of generalization. While deep learning models can perform remarkably well on specific tasks like digit recognition, the leap to more general image understanding requires discovering overarching predicates or ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. This limitation suggests that while models may excel at narrowly defined tasks, extending their capabilities to broader applications remains a challenge.

## Predicates and Learning with Few Examples

Deep learning models typically require large datasets to achieve high accuracy, as seen in tasks like MNIST digit recognition which traditionally use around 60,000 examples. Vapnik proposes that predicates might help reduce this requirement, potentially allowing models to achieve similar levels of performance with far fewer examples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>. However, identifying and implementing these predicates stands as a significant hurdle.

## Conclusion

The discussion between Lex Fridman and Vladimir Vapnik highlights several critical limitations of deep learning: the gap between imitation and understanding, the complexity of predicate discovery, and the challenges in generalizing tasks. These limitations point towards the need for a deeper integration of theoretical insights from disciplines like philosophy and cognitive science to expand the scope and effectiveness of deep learning systems.

Waymo, a subsidiary of Alphabet Inc., has been a significant player in the development and deployment of self-driving technology. The company has achieved impressive milestones and continues to push the boundaries in autonomous vehicle technology.

## Milestones in Waymo's Journey

Waymo began its journey as part of Google's self-driving car project, known as [[waymos_journey_from_googles_selfdriving_car_project_to_an_independent_company | Chauffeur]], in 2009. The project initially focused on assembling a vehicle with off-the-shelf sensors to explore the feasibility of self-driving technology. The first successful demonstration was achieved in 2010 when Waymo's predecessor completed 1,000 autonomous miles across various challenging routes in Northern California [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>].

In 2017, Waymo became an independent company, marking a major milestone that allowed it to move into the commercialization phase [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>]. Since then, Waymo has continued its growth, including expanding its testing operations to new geographical areas like San Francisco [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:26">[01:01:26]</a>].

## The Role of Technology

### Machine Learning and Deep Learning

Waymo's self-driving technology heavily relies on machine learning and deep learning. These technologies have evolved over time, with breakthroughs that allowed for more sophisticated perception systems in vehicles. One key element is the use of convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which help the vehicle interpret and understand its environment [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>].

### Perception and Sensor Systems

Perception is crucial for autonomous driving, requiring the integration of various sensors such as lidar, radar, and cameras. These sensors work together to create a comprehensive understanding of the vehicleâ€™s surroundings. They provide complementary information; for example, cameras offer dense semantic details, while lidar provides precise depth data [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>].

Waymo has developed its sensors in-house to enhance the performance and reliability of its perception system. This system must not only detect objects but also predict potential future actions of other road users to make safe driving decisions [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>].

## Challenges and Future Directions

Developing self-driving technology is complex, requiring significant resources and advanced engineering capabilities. One of the primary challenges is ensuring the system's ability to operate safely in diverse conditions, from urban environments to harsh weather [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>].

Waymo is actively addressing these challenges by expanding its testing in different environments and continuously improving its understanding of urban driving dynamics. Their mission is to make autonomous vehicles safe and accessible for public use while continuously advancing the technology to handle a broader range of driving scenarios [<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>].

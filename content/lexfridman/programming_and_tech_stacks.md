The world of programming is complex and continually evolving, with developers often debating the merits of various technologies, frameworks, and tools. Choosing the right tech stack is crucial for both seasoned developers and those entering the field. This article delves into the nuances of programming and tech stacks, drawing insights from a podcast discussion with Peter Levels, a successful developer known for launching over 40 startups.

## Choosing the Right Tech Stack

Peter Levels is a proponent of using a minimal tech stack to swiftly build and deploy products. His approach revolves around using what you know best, rather than chasing the latest trends in programming languages or frameworks. Levels primarily uses a stack comprising vanilla HTML, jQuery, PHP, and SQLite. Despite being often labeled as outdated, these technologies have proven effective for his rapid prototyping and deployment needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

> "I don't use VC funding; I do everything myself... For me, I'm much more Scrappy. And because I don't have funding, I need to go fast. I need to make things fast to see if an idea works." - Peter Levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>

### The Pragmatic Approach

Levels emphasizes that the best tech stack is often the simplest one that you are most familiar with. His methodology involves rapidly building and launching products to test market viability. This approach contrasts sharply with traditional startup methodologies that rely heavily on investment, large teams, and complex infrastructure. For Levels, speed and agility are paramount, not exhaustive feature sets or the latest tech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Learning and Adapting

Even with a deep understanding of his preferred stack, Levels acknowledges the importance of continuous learning. He admits to having a to-do list item for learning Node.js, as it seems like an important transition from PHP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. The lesson here is the value of incremental learning and keeping abreast of potential improvements within one's workflow.

## The Influence of New Technologies

While Levels sticks to what he knows, he also keeps an eye on new tech advancements. For example, he incorporates AI technologies such as [stable diffusion](https://stablediffusionweb.com/) and uses cloud compute platforms like [replicate.com](https://replicate.com/) to host machine learning models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:19">[00:37:19]</a>. This hybrid approach allows him to innovate while sticking to the fundamentals he trusts.

## Open Source vs. Proprietary Technology

A recurring theme in Levels' approach is an appreciation for open-source technologies, which he believes offer flexibility and community-driven enhancements. He provides a critical viewpoint on closed platforms, emphasizing the need to understand their underlying business models and the potential long-term cost of adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Peter Levels' experience offers a compelling case for the pragmatic use of tech stacks. His success shows that sometimes, using outdated or simpler technologies can be advantageous if they enable rapid development and deployment. His story is a testament to the benefits of starting small, learning continuously, and integrating new technologies judiciously.

For more on Peter Levelsâ€™ philosophy and practical insights on programming and tech stacks, listening to his interviews and exploring the accompanying projects on platforms like GitHub or Twitter (or X, as it's known) can be valuable. Whether you're a new developer or a seasoned engineer, there are lessons to be drawn from his unique approach to tech and entrepreneurship.

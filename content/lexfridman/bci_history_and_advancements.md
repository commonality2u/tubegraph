Brain-Computer Interfaces (BCIs) have a rich and evolving history, beginning with foundational discoveries in neuroscience and evolving into sophisticated technologies aimed at enhancing human capabilities and restoring lost functions.

> [!info] Definition of BCI
> 
> BCIs refer to technologies that enable direct communication between the brain and external devices, bypassing conventional neuromuscular pathways.

## Early Discoveries

### 18th and 19th Century Foundations

- **Animal Electricity and Luigi Galvani**: The notion of animal electricity, or the fact that the body could conduct electricity, was demonstrated by Luigi Galvani in the 1790s when he observed frog legs twitching with electrical stimulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:48">[01:43:48]</a>.

### 20th Century Developments

- **1920s - Electroencephalography (EEG)**: Hans Berger developed EEG, a technique for recording electrical activity on the scalp, which provides a non-invasive way to measure brain activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:07">[01:44:07]</a>.

- **1940s - Glass Microelectrodes**: Attempts to record single neuron activity were undertaken by scientists like Renshaw, Forbes, and Morrison using glass microelectrodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:36">[01:44:36]</a>.

- **1950s - Hodgkin and Huxley Models**: Development of models of the ionic mechanisms underlying nerve membrane excitation, which won the Nobel Prize in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.

## Key Milestones in BCI Development

### Operant Conditioning and Cortical Units

- In 1969, **Eb Fetz** demonstrated that monkeys could modulate firing rates of single neurons through operant conditioning, considered an early demonstration of BCI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:34">[01:45:34]</a>.

### Motor Tuning Curves and Brain Mapping (1980s)

- **Motor Tuning Curves**: The discovery that certain neurons are activated by specific directional movements. This understanding laid the groundwork for decoding movement intentions from neural signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>.

## Invasive versus Non-invasive BCIs

### Non-invasive BCIs

- Utilizes EEG and other surface electrodes to measure brain activity without penetrating the skull. These interfaces generally provide lower resolution data.

### Invasive BCIs

- Involves the placement of electrodes directly on or in the brain tissue to achieve higher resolution and more detailed readings of neural activity. As of recent advances, companies like Neuralink are developing flexible electrode threads that reduce cortical trauma and improve longevity of data collection capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>.

## Modern Advances and Applications

### Neuralink's Innovations

- **Flexible Threads**: Neuralink is pioneering the use of ultra-flexible threads that are thinner than a human hair, aiming to record more neurons with less brain interference, thereby reducing immune responses and increasing implant longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>.

- **Surgical Robotics (R1 Robot)**: Automated systems to precisely implant electrode threads, utilizing computer vision to avoid blood vessels during placement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:43">[02:17:43]</a>.

- **Current Applications and Future Directions**: Initial applications focus on restoring functions to individuals with paralysis by providing digital command via direct neural signals. Future aspirations include enhancing human capabilities, such as speeding up communication speeds beyond natural limits and restoring or improving vision in the blind by direct cortical stimulation of visual centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:29">[03:13:29]</a>.

## Conclusion

BCIs have moved from speculative science to tangible technology with the potential to transform medical science and human-computer interaction. Companies like Neuralink are at the forefront, pushing the boundaries of what is possible by advancing how we directly interface with our brain's electrical signals.

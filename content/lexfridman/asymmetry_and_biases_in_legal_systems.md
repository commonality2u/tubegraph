The conversation featuring Muhammad Alcard, a Palestinian poet and activist, delves deeply into the asymmetry and biases prevalent in legal systems, particularly focusing on the Israeli-Palestinian context. Alcard's personal experiences and broader observations on the legal struggles faced by Palestinians highlight significant systemic inequalities and the implications of these biases.

## Legal Asymmetry in Israel and Palestine

Alcard provides a compelling account of the disproportionate power imbalance within the Israeli legal system. According to him, courts consistently favor Israeli settlers over Palestinians, ignoring Palestinian land ownership documents and arguments. The Judiciary is criticized for taking Israeli documents at face value while dismissing those from Jordanian, Ottoman, or U.N. archives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## The Influence of Politics and Power Structures

Alcard argues that the legal battles in places like Sheikh Jarrah are not mere real estate disputes, as portrayed by some Israeli authorities, but rather political battles deeply rooted in social engineering and demographic changes aimed at displacing Palestinians <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. He accuses the Israeli legal system of being a tool for colonialism and describes how even the law's technical legality can still be morally wrong, drawing parallels with other historical injustices like Jim Crow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.

## International Law and its Limitations

In discussing the international perspective, Alcard highlights the failure of international systems to effectively intervene on behalf of Palestinians due to the entrenched power structures that benefit from the status quo. Even global campaigns necessitating the support of outside communities often face resistance due to political interests that overshadow humanitarian concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:15">[01:37:15]</a>.

## The Role of Historical Narratives

Alcard underscores the importance of understanding historical narratives as they inform the biases present in legal systems. The Zionist narrative and its impact on the legal discourse are depicted as being deeply influential, with historical events like the Nakba being pivotal to these discussions. Alcard calls for the necessity of acknowledging and addressing these historical injustices if meaningful progress is to be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.

## Potential Pathways Towards Justice

For Alcard, true justice entails the recognition of past injustices, the right of return for Palestinian refugees, and a redistribution of resources. He believes these steps are necessary for any genuine reconciliation and peace process. Without addressing the foundational biases and asymmetries in the legal systems, he argues, there is little hope for a just and equitable resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

The discussion on asymmetry and biases in legal systems, as presented through Muhammad Alcard's insights, offers a vital critique of how these systems can perpetuate inequality and injustice. By examining these structures through the lens of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict, the conversation highlights broader implications for how legal systems can be manipulated to serve power, rather than justice. Addressing these biases is essential for building equitable legal frameworks that uphold the rights and dignity of all individuals.

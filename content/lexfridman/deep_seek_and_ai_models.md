## Introduction

The conversation centers on a groundbreaking period in AI, marked by the emergence of AI models developed by Deep Seek, a Chinese company that has made significant strides in improving the efficiency and effectiveness of AI models. The discussion involves experts Dylan Patel and Nathan Lambert, delving into various aspects of AI development, implications for global AI dynamics, and concerns surrounding data, licensing, and international relations.

## Background on Deep Seek

Deep Seek has gained attention with its AI models, namely Deep Seek V3 and Deep Seek R1. V3 is a mixture of experts Transformer language model, while R1 focuses on reasoning capabilities, catering to complex problem-solving scenarios. Released first, V3 is positioned as an instruction model similar to ones used in popular AI applications like [[artificial_intelligence_and_deep_learning | ChatGPT]]. R1 follows, with a focus on reasoning, showcasing the capability to improve over V3 via more sophisticated training regimes that connect with post-training behaviors and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Innovations in AI Models

### Mixture of Experts and MLA Techniques

Deep Seek's significant innovation lies in its implementation of a mixture of experts. This technique allows different parts of the model to activate depending on the task, mimicking a more human-like approach to problem-solving. This innovation reduces both training and inference costs by avoiding the need to activate every parameter for each task. Deep Seek also introduced a new technique called MLA (latency-attentive transformer) which enhances memory usage efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:25">[00:25:25]</a>.

### Open Weights and Licensing

Deep Seek's AI models are open weight models, meaning the model weights are available for download, typically with certain license agreements governing their use. This openness is instrumental in pushing forward AI research by allowing other researchers and companies to build upon existing work. However, it raises discussions around data privacy and potential misuse of models by various entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Deep Seek R1 Model

Deep Seek R1 is characterized by its reasoning model capabilities, developed through extensive training steps designed to overlap with those of V3, yet employing an entirely new regime that focuses heavily on emergent reasoning techniques—something not fully achieved by simple pre-training methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The approach in training helps the model develop reasoning skills that can attempt verifiable tasks through trial and error akin to reinforcement learning methods often seen in systems like AlphaGo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:59">[00:46:59]</a>.

## Economic and Geopolitical Implications

### Economic Implications for AI and Hardware Companies

Deep Seek's innovations triggered significant market reactions. The developments in AI models that improve efficiency and reduce costs affect hardware companies like Nvidia because efficient models may require fewer GPUs, potentially impacting Nvidia's market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:37">[03:14:37]</a>.

### Geopolitical Concerns

The discussion brings into focus the geopolitics of AI between the US and China. Export controls imposed by the US are seen as a mechanism to maintain a technological edge and dictate who gains access to the most advanced AI capabilities. However, the presence of sophisticated AI models like those from Deep Seek presents challenges and questions regarding global power dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

The advancements made by Deep Seek illustrate profound shifts in AI development, capability, and deployment. Through open-source models and improved model architectures, Deep Seek’s contributions challenge existing players and provoke global discussions on the future of AI technology. The conversation suggests that continued innovation, transparency, and careful consideration of ethical and economic impacts will be essential factors driving the field of AI forward amidst rapid technological change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

The transition from military service to civilian life can pose numerous challenges for many veterans. For those who have experienced combat, the return home can be even more complex, as they navigate life with physical, emotional, or psychological scars. Nonprofit organizations and businesses alike have long worked to develop ways to support these individuals, and interestingly, art and business have emerged as powerful mediums through which veterans can find rehabilitation and community.

## Brass and Unity: A Model of Art for Healing

One notable example is the Canadian company Brass and Unity, founded by Kelsey Sharon, a veteran who served in Afghanistan. Following her service and the onset of severe PTSD, Kelsey discovered that art therapy was instrumental in her journey to recovery. Inspired by this experience, she founded Brass and Unity, which specializes in crafting unique jewelry items, with a significant portion of the proceeds going towards supporting rehabilitative initiatives for veterans and first responders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

### Art Therapy and Mental Health

Art therapy is gaining recognition as a vital tool in assisting veterans to process their experiences. Kelsey's introduction to art therapy through jewelry making proved pivotal, as it allowed her to channel creativity as a form of emotional expression and healing. By creating wearable art pieces from spent bullet casings, Kelsey not only found a personal outlet for her trauma but also transformed items of destruction into symbols of solidarity and support. This transformative process highlights the therapeutic potential of art, as it allows individuals to recontextualize their experiences and emotions in a constructive manner.

## Business as a Catalyst for Veteran Support

Beyond therapy, the business model of companies like Brass and Unity emphasizes the power of entrepreneurship as a vehicle for positive change. By donating a significant portion of its profits to veteran services, Brass and Unity exemplifies how business ventures can directly contribute to social causes. This model not only provides financial support to essential services but also raises awareness and fosters community engagement around veterans' issues.

### An Entrepreneurial Approach

Kelseyâ€™s business is also a testament to the entrepreneurial spirit, showing how personal challenges can be transformed into powerful opportunities for impact. Brass and Unity started when Kelsey began crafting her own jewelry at home, a venture that gradually evolved into a sustainable business with a clear mission. This entrepreneurial approach underscores the idea that businesses with a purpose can thrive while also making a substantial societal contribution.

## The Wider Impact of Veteran-Focused Businesses

Brass and Unity is just one example among many of how businesses can play a critical role in supporting veterans. Other organizations and foundations have adopted similar models, bridging the gap between entrepreneurship and social enterprise to provide veterans with the resources, skills, and community support they need.

### Building Networks and Community

One essential facet of veteran-focused businesses like Brass and Unity is their ability to build networks and foster community among veterans. These enterprises often function as hubs for former service members to connect, share experiences, and find mutual support. The community aspect not only aids in direct peer support but also helps to normalize discussions around mental health issues, reducing the stigma that many veterans might face when seeking help.

## Conclusion

The integration of art and business in veteran support initiatives like Brass and Unity provides a compelling model for how modern enterprises can contribute to societal well-being. By championing the dual roles of art as therapy and business as a social enterprise, organizations can create innovative pathways for veterans to heal, thrive, and reintegrate into civilian life. In recognizing the value and impact of such models, we move closer to understanding and addressing the comprehensive needs of veterans in our communities.

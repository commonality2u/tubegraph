## Introduction

Tulsi Gabbard has been a prominent figure in American politics, known for her bold stances and unique perspectives. Initially a member of the Democratic Party, she eventually left to become an independent. This article explores Tulsi Gabbard’s political journey, focusing on her views on both the Democratic and Republican parties.

## Early Involvement and Leadership in the Democratic Party

Tulsi Gabbard began her political career as a Democrat, serving in state government and on the city council in Honolulu. She later became the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), a position she resigned from in 2016 to endorse Bernie Sanders during the Democratic primary election. Gabbard was motivated by what she perceived as unfair practices within the DNC, particularly the favoritism shown towards Hillary Clinton over Bernie Sanders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

Gabbard highlighted issues within the Democratic party, such as the party leadership's unwillingness to question candidate records critically, especially on foreign policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>. Her decision to support Bernie Sanders was driven by her alignment with his non-interventionist foreign policy views, contrasting sharply with Clinton, whom Gabbard described as a war hawk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:57">[01:20:57]</a>.

## Criticism of the Democratic Party

In "For Love of Country," Gabbard detailed her reasons for leaving the Democratic Party. She criticized the party for becoming one that is "opposed to Freedom" and controlled by an "elitist cabal of Warmongers," which is driven by a desire for power rather than upholding foundational American principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:21">[01:22:21]</a>. She decried the party’s embrace of woke policies, from racial politics to defund-the-police initiatives, and the impact on educational standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:06">[01:24:06]</a>.

Gabbard has been vocal about the party's hypocrisy regarding gender identity issues, accusing them of attempting to erase the identity of "woman," which she views as an act of hatred towards women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:26">[01:24:26]</a>. Her disillusionment with the Democratic party culminated in her decision to leave, fueled by what she saw as the party’s insatiable hunger for power without regard for the Republic or democracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a>.

## Perspectives on the Republican Party

While Gabbard has criticized both major parties, she acknowledges certain differences. She notes that the Republican party is not a monolithic entity and highlights some increasing voices within the party, like Donald Trump, who challenge traditional norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:07">[01:28:07]</a>. Gabbard sees the Republican party as having voices that are more open to challenging the status quo compared to Democrats, who she accuses of stifling debate within their ranks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>.

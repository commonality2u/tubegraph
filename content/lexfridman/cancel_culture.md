Cancel culture is a term used to describe the phenomenon of organizing campaigns to get individuals fired, expelled, or otherwise de-platformed for their expressions and speech which would typically be protected under the First Amendment in the United States. This phenomenon became notably prevalent around 2014, particularly within academic environments such as college campuses, where it has since contributed to a climate of fear that suppresses freedom of expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Historical Context

The concept of cancel culture gained significant traction in public discourse starting in 2014, and it was further explored by various authors and scholars. For instance, John Ronson's book "So You've Been Publicly Shamed" released in 2015 documented this phenomenon, while Greg Glucianov's earlier work, "Freedom From Speech" from 2014, also delved into the growing restrictions on speech and its impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

In the same vein, Greg Glucianov, a First Amendment attorney and advocate for freedom of speech, has consistently highlighted the repercussions of cancel culture. In collaboration with Jonathan Haidt, Glucianov co-authored "The Coddling of the American Mind," exploring the cultural and psychological influences exacerbating this cancel culture ethos. He also contributed to writing the book "The Canceling of the American Mind" with Ricky Schlot, which is considered a definitive account of the history and the ongoing developments in cancel culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Cancel Culture Explained

At its core, cancel culture refers to the surge of campaigns, often mounted by activists and segments of the public, aiming to punish individuals for speech considered controversial or offensive. Notably, the campaign's focus is typically on speech that might not fall directly under legal scrutiny but is nonetheless perceived as inappropriate within certain social norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The impact on college campuses has been quite significant as these institutions are supposedly places where ideas, including those that are controversial or unpopular, should be debated vigorously. However, cancel culture fosters an environment where conformity is valued over intellectual risk-taking. Notably, many professors and students have faced consequences for expressing viewpoints that deviate from dominant cultural or political norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Mechanisms of Cancel Culture

Cancel culture can manifest in several ways on different sides of the political spectrum. Greg Glucianov explains that while there is a perception that cancel culture is more prevalent on the left, particularly in academia, there are also instances where right-leaning entities partake in similar actions. For example, campaigns to get books banned or people de-platformed are not exclusive to one political ideology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

A significant risk inherent in cancel culture is group polarization. When individuals are censored for their opinions, they often retreat to groups where those opinions are not just accepted but championed, leading to further entrenchment and extremism. Thus, rather than changing minds, such censorship can exacerbate divisions and reinforce ideologies seen as undesirable by those advocating for censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Role of Technology and Social Media

The rapid spread and normalization of cancel culture has been aided significantly by social media platforms. These digital spaces not only allow for the quick dissemination and amplification of calls for cancelation but also facilitate the pooling of individuals who share similar viewpoints, thus accelerating the polarization process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>.

## Counteraction and Free Speech Advocacy

Several organizations, such as FIRE (Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression), led by Greg Glucianov, work to counteract the effects of cancel culture by defending free speech and promoting a culture where ideas can be freely exchanged without fear of punitive measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Freedom of speech, according to Glucianov, should involve a broader application beyond mere legal entitlement. It should foster an environment where speech is freely expressed without fear of retribution from public or private institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

In conclusion, the ongoing dialogues on cancel culture need to be managed with careful consideration of both its immediate impacts and long-term implications for a society that values diversity of thought. Promoting discourse over silencing dissenting voices is essential in cultivating a robust and healthy public sphere.

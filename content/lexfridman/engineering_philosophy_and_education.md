The recent conversation with artist and producer Ye, formerly known as Kanye West, on [The Lex Friedman Podcast](https://lexfridman.com/) presents a fascinating exploration of the intersections between engineering philosophy and education. Ye brings a unique perspective that intertwines personal experience with broader visions for society, highlighting the importance of engineering and education in shaping our future.

## Engineering as the Core of Education

Ye posits that the only essential subject that should be taught in schools is engineering. He believes that subjects such as history, which he refers to as "subjective," are unnecessary in comparison to engineering, which is integral to [shaping our most important societal and technological innovations](https://yt-timestamp.com?data-t="00:01:11"):

> **"That's the only thing that we really need to teach in school is engineering. We don't need to teach history... It needs to only be engineering taught in school, and everything else needs to be recess."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

Ye suggests that an education focused solely on engineering would prevent the spread of subjective information, which he perceives as weakening and indoctrinating our species <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Beyond Conventional Education: Engineering Opportunities

Ye extends the notion of engineering beyond traditional classroom education to encompass life itself. He envisions a new species constitution that emphasizes humans being born with engineering challenges and opportunities before them:

> **"You Are a Human Being with engineering challenges before you... I consider challenges to be opportunities in front of you."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>

This perspective encourages individuals to embrace challenges as opportunities for growth and innovation, fostering an entrepreneurial mindset. It resonates with the philosophies of figures like Steve Jobs and Elon Musk, who Ye references as cultural engineers who have significantly influenced modern society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Creating an Impact: Education and Social Responsibility

Ye's discourse also emphasizes the role of education in enhancing social responsibility. He criticizes how certain historical narratives and media can shape perceptions and thus education should empower youth to harness facts and foster innovative thinking:

> **"It's kids out there right that are gonna save the world through engineering and through facts."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>

Moreover, he highlights the importance of transparency in various industries, suggesting that re-engineering societal systems and structures can lead to healthier, more equitable communities.

## Engineering and Visionary Leadership

Ye outlines a vision where engineering intertwines with leadership, advocating for a revamped education system that prioritizes engineering principles as foundational in all fields. He emphasizes the need for leaders to be engineers of social change:

> **"What us as beings with the engineering opportunity need to do right now is find the blue water where we agree on."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:40">[00:55:40]</a>

This statement illustrates an approach that harmonizes design, leadership, and technology, urging present and future generations to collaborate and innovate in bridging societal gaps.

## [Leadership and Teamwork in Engineering Projects](https://wiki-link/leadership_and_teamwork_in_engineering_projects)

Ye's dialogue underscores the necessity of leadership and collaboration within engineering projects, suggesting that innovative solutions arise from collective effort, shared goals, and thoughtful engineering leadership.

In summary, Ye's insights on the podcast challenge established educational norms and invite us to reconsider engineering as a central tenet of education. It propels forward the idea that engineering education ultimately fosters a more innovative, inclusive, and future-oriented society.

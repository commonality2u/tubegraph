OpenAI is a research organization focused on developing artificial general intelligence (AGI) that is both safe and beneficial to humanity. Co-founded by [[elon_musk_and_openai_relationship | Elon Musk]], Greg Brockman, who is also the Chief Technology Officer, describes OpenAI's mission as aiming to create AGI that empowers and benefits all humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07">[02:07]</a>. This mission is foundational to OpenAI's structure and strategic decisions, which prioritize broad benefit over individual gain.

## Core Mission and Charter

### Objectives

OpenAI's charter outlines a commitment to ensuring that AGI benefits everyone and does not unduly concentrate power. Their approach is distinct in that they are focused not solely on being the primary creators of AGI but ensuring that the deployment of AGI is done in a way where all of humanity benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02">[27:02]</a>. OpenAI's willingness to collaborate with other organizations highlights this, emphasizing the importance of cooperation over competition in later stages of AGI development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:31">[40:31]</a>.

### Approach

The organization is structured in such a way that aligns with its charter. This alignment means that decisions are made with the intent of minimizing conflicts of interest while pursuing their broad technological goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:03">[29:03]</a>. OpenAI acknowledges that to develop AGI, substantial resources are needed, including funding far beyond typical non-profit capabilities. Thus, they formed OpenAI LP, a capped-profit company structure that allows for raising necessary funds while still aligning with their larger mission of benefiting humanity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:06">[28:06]</a>.

## Operational Philosophy

### Iterative Development

OpenAI places a significant emphasis on the iterative development of AI technologies. This process involves scaling existing models and enhancing their capabilities over time. For example, the progression from earlier GPT models to more advanced versions like GPT-2 reflects this iterative process, where scaling models can lead to unexpected capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00">[23:00]</a>.

### Focus Areas

OpenAI operates with a three-pronged approach toward capabilities, safety, and policy:
- **Capabilities**: Pushing forward what AI systems can do enhances their research and development process in technology.
- **Safety**: Developing technical mechanisms to ensure AI systems align with human values.
- **Policy**: Establishing governance mechanisms that address whose values are being prioritized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19">[13:19]</a>.

## Future Vision

OpenAI is driven by the prospect of AGI being the most transformative human-created technology, maximizing benefits and minimizing risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:31">[19:31]</a>. They emphasize setting the "initial conditions" under which AGI is developed, akin to how the open nature of the internet has shaped its development thus far <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51">[06:51]</a>.

## Conclusion

OpenAI strives to ensure that AGI acts as a catalyst for human augmentation rather than creating disparities. Their focus on iterative improvements, combined with a mission-driven charter, underscores their commitment to a future where AGI can be safely and broadly beneficial. Through collaboration and cautious scaling of technologies, OpenAI aims to pioneer the responsible development and deployment of AGI systems, encouraging a discourse on both technology and ethics in the field.

## The Operation and Adventures

Reaves' operations spanned across six continents, where he transported tons of cocaine and marijuana. His career was laden with danger, including multiple escapes from prison, surviving torture in a Mexican prison, and being shot down in both Mexico and Colombia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Despite his involvement in drug transport, Reaves maintained a stance of non-violence, emphasizing that he never participated in the violent activities typical of his colleagues, such as Escobar and Ochoa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Working with the Medellin Cartel

Reaves' introduction to the Medellin Cartel came through his dealings with Jorge Ochoa and Pablo Escobar. Describing them as "nice people," Reaves recounted his meetings with them to negotiate terms for drug shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. His confidence in their business integrity stemmed from the assurance of receiving ironed and banded money and their reputed system of operation that rarely involved betrayal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

During his tenure with the cartel, Reaves facilitated a significant drug transportation system, ensuring the delivery of cocaine via air routes and jungle strips. His skill as a pilot, combined with his knowledge of secret landing strips, allowed him to evade U.S. border patrols. Reaves’ flights from Colombia involved elaborate strategies, such as landing to refuel in Nicaragua, which was part of a broader operation linked to [the role of Mexican and US governments in the drug war](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Iran%E2%80%93Contra_affair) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>.

## Relationship with Barry Seal

Reaves hired Barry Seal to fly significant drug loads, paying him a million dollars per trip. Seal's familiarity with complex flight maneuvers made him invaluable to Reaves’ operations. Though their partnership was primarily business-focused, it highlighted the intricate networks formed during this period, including Seal's previous alleged connections with the CIA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:50">[00:48:50]</a>.

## Views on the War on Drugs

Reaves holds a critical view of the war on drugs, attributing significant societal damage to its prohibitionist policies. He points to the substantial financial burden it has imposed on American taxpayers and the detrimental effect on countless lives caught up in drug-related offenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Despite his criminal history, Reaves questions the moral judgments placed on individuals like him while recognizing worse injustices perpetuated by entities in political office or corporate power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Reflection and Personal Life

Reaves’ personal life, largely affected by his illicit career, highlights a tale of adventure combined with deep personal loss. His relationship with his wife, Mari, remained constant, with her unwavering support through his incarcerations worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Despite his past, Reaves conveyed sadness over missed years with his family, a sentiment echoed poignantly by the lifestyle depicted in the film *Blow* about George Jung, which he regards as a well-captured narrative of a similar life journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>.

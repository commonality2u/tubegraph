Anarchism, as a political philosophy, embraces a variety of approaches to achieving a society free from hierarchical authority and state governance. A key debate within anarchism revolves around the tension between pacifism and activism, particularly regarding the use of violence. This discourse is critical in understanding how different anarchists interpret the role of violence in achieving and maintaining a free society.

## The Pacifist Anarchist Perspective

The pacifist wing of anarchism is principally concerned with the moral implications of using violence as a means of resistance or societal change. Notable anarchists such as [[leo_tolstoy | Leo Tolstoy]] espoused a Christian anarchist approach, advocating for non-violence and steering clear of physical confrontation in a bid to uphold the individual's integrity and moral values. Tolstoy's perspective influenced figures like [[martin_luther_king | Martin Luther King Jr.]] and [[mahatma_gandhi | Mahatma Gandhi]], who were proponents of non-violent resistance in their respective movements.

## Activist Anarchism and the Role of Violence

On the other side of the spectrum, activist anarchists, including figures like [[emma_goldman | Emma Goldman]], took a more pragmatic approach to violence, viewing it as a potential necessary evil in the fight against oppressive systems. For Goldman, violence was defensible under certain conditions, especially when used as a mechanism for revolutionary change and opposing totalitarian governance.

She was influenced by her mentor Johann Most, who advocated for dynamite as a tool to level the playing field against state power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:43">[02:10:43]</a>.

## The Ethical Dilemma

The ethical dilemma within anarchism is the balance between achieving immediate, tangible results and maintaining a purely ethical stance. Pacifist anarchists argue that the use of violence corrupts the cause, as it mirrors the very forms of coercion and dominance they seek to dismantle. In contrast, activist anarchists might argue that the stateâ€™s inherently violent nature necessitates a robust response to dismantle its structures, potentially justifying violent measures as a form of self-defense or revolutionary necessity.

## Conclusion

The discourse between pacifism and activism within anarchism highlights the diverse methodologies embedded in the philosophy. While Tolstoy-inspired pacifists hold fast to the power and moral high ground of non-violence, activists like Goldman contend with the practical exigencies of political struggle. This dynamic underlines not only the philosophical richness of anarchism but also the challenges of applying its ideals in the messy reality of socio-political movements.

The debate persists in contemporary anarchist circles, garnering diverse interpretations that continue to fuel discussions on ethics, strategy, and the ultimate goals of anarchism as both a political theory and a social movement.

In the modern era, the concept of [[freedom_of_speech_in_the_digital_age | freedom of speech]] has transformed significantly due to the proliferation of digital platforms and social media, posing both opportunities and challenges in maintaining an open public discourse.

## The Role of Algorithms

In today's digital landscape, algorithms have become the gatekeepers of content, influencing who gets heard and how content is distributed. This evolution marks a shift from traditional gatekeeping roles, where industry insiders made decisions on what content saw the light of day, to a more automated process with systems run by YouTube, Twitter, Facebook, and others.

> This algorithmic control is not fully understood even by those who work at these platforms, leading to a lack of transparency and increased [[impact_of_social_media_on_free_speech | anxiety among content creators]] concerning [[deplatforming_and_censorship | censorship]] and being removed from platforms without clear reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02">[19:02]</a>.

## The Dangers of Deplatforming

There have been significant discussions around the topic of a digital public square, where major platforms hold great power in shaping public discourse. This concern is amplified with instances like Amazon removing Parler from AWS, where infrastructure choices impact who can participate in digital conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06">[23:06]</a>.

### Case Study: Parler and AWS

The removal of Parler highlighted the impact tech companies can have on freedom of speech. It raised the question of whether tech giants are acting as neutral carriers of information or if they sway the dialogue by controlling access to their infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:02">[23:02]</a>.

## Addressing the Issues

1. **Transparency**: Behind closed doors, decisions are made by companies like Twitter with little transparency to the outside world. There is a vital need for more open processes where individuals have the ability to defend themselves against deplatforming decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54">[38:54]</a>.

2. **Freedom of Expression vs. Censorship**: The debate often centers on what constitutes as genuine threats or [[censorship_and_freedom_of_speech | harmful speech]] versus meaningful criticism or satire, such as with controversial figures like [[deplatforming_and_censorship | Alex Jones]], whose deplatforming from multiple platforms sparked widespread debate about censorship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:07">[36:07]</a>.

3. **Human Moderation**: There is a growing demand for a human element in content moderation decisions instead of relying solely on algorithms, to ensure accuracy and fairness in content evaluation.

## Conclusion

The digital age continues to challenge traditional notions of free speech. While digital platforms provide vast new arenas for expression, they also present new hurdles under the guise of algorithmic censorship and lack of accountability. Stakeholders in the digital ecosystem need to navigate these complex issues to ensure a balanced approach to [[free_speech_and_censorship | free speech and censorship]]. The resolution is not straightforward, as it necessitates reconciling the freedoms we cherish with the oversight mechanisms that prevent misuse.

War and conflict have been significant forces shaping human history and society. This article explores the various aspects of war, including its impact, the narratives that drive it, and contemporary examples such as the conflicts in Yemen and Ukraine. Through the lens of documentary filmmaking, we also examine the role individuals and organizations play in addressing the humanitarian crises that arise from war.

## Impact of War

> War often results in severe humanitarian crises, including starvation used as a weapon. International humanitarian law, including the Geneva Conventions, prohibits starvation as a weapon, yet it continues to be utilized in conflicts such as those in Yemen and Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:02">[02:01:02]</a>.

### Humanitarian Crises

War creates dire humanitarian needs. Documentary filmmaker Skye Fitzgerald highlights that many of today's hunger crises are exacerbated by the intentional use of starvation in conflict zones. Leaders use starvation to control or decimate populations, as seen in historical and current conflicts. International law attempts to curb such tactics, but enforcement remains weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Displacement

Conflict leads to massive displacement of people. By 2022, over 79 million people were displaced worldwide, with the war in Ukraine further exacerbating the situation. This places additional strains on global resources dedicated to assisting refugees and internally displaced persons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Narratives of War

Every conflict is driven and sustained by narratives, some rooted in truth and others in propaganda. For instance, the Saudi-led coalition's narrative justifies their intervention in Yemen by labeling the Houthi government as illegitimate, framing the conflict as a counter to Iranian influence in the region. However, this narrative often oversimplifies the complexities of regional politics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:53">[02:00:53]</a>.

### Contemporary Examples

#### Yemen

The war in Yemen exemplifies a complex and asymmetrical conflict. The Saudi-led coalition, with significant international backing, wages war against Houthi rebels, employing tactics that result in large-scale civilian suffering from airstrikes and blockades. These military strategies contribute to widespread famine and hinder humanitarian assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

#### Ukraine

The conflict in Ukraine, particularly intense since 2022, showcases the use of siege tactics and other forms of aggressive warfare. In addition to traditional military battles, disinformation campaigns bolster the narratives that drive the war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:19">[00:36:19]</a>.

## Humanitarian Efforts

### Lifeboat Operations

In response to crises precipitated by war, many NGOs and voluntary organizations have undertaken rescue operations in regions like the Mediterranean. In areas where state interventions are lacking, groups such as Sea Watch have made significant efforts to rescue asylum seekers risking their lives to cross dangerous waters for safety and a chance at a better life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:03">[01:51:03]</a>.

### Heroic Acts

In war zones, ordinary individuals often become heroes by performing acts of immense bravery and compassion. For example, a Turkish businessman who, driven by empathy, ferried the injured across the border to safety and medical care during the conflict in Syria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>.

## Conclusion

War and conflict continue to be pivotal in shaping societies, often leading to tragic humanitarian outcomes. Understanding the narratives and power dynamics that fuel these conflicts is essential for crafting effective responses. As documentary storytelling demonstrates, individuals and NGOs play vital roles in offering hope and assistance amidst the despair of war. The efforts to document these stories not only inform the global audience but also challenge leaders to work towards conflict resolution and humanitarian support.

The concept of free will has ignited philosophical and scientific debates for centuries, questioning whether human beings are truly autonomous in their decisions or if choices are influenced by predetermined neurological processes. In a recent conversation with Lisa Feldman Barrett, a professor of psychology at Northeastern University, some light was shed on how the brain may influence perceptions of free will.

> Lisa Feldman Barrett is renowned for her groundbreaking research on emotions and the brain. She is the author of "How Emotions Are Made" and "Seven and a Half Lessons About the Brain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Understanding Free Will

Free will relates to the notion of making choices that are not constrained by external circumstances or predetermined by prior events. From a neuroscience perspective, the idea of free will is closely related to how the brain constructs and navigates the concept of decision-making.

### Predictions and the Internal Model

Barrett describes the brain as primarily a prediction machine. It uses past experiences to anticipate future events and sensory data, tightly coupling predictions with actions and perceptions. The brain doesnâ€™t merely react to stimuli; instead, it constructs models of the world that guide behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00">[30:00]</a>.

**Key Insights:**
- The brain predicts continuously, forming actions based on past experiences without needing to validate against current sensory data for every prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00">[30:00]</a>.
- A reflex in this context is a prediction that does not rely on immediate sensory confirmation due to its critical nature, showcasing how deeply ingrained and "automatic" some actions become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00">[30:00]</a>.

### The Role of Free Will

Barrett suggests that what might be considered free will is more about cultivating new experiences that alter one's internal model:

- **Experience Cultivation:** As individuals create new environments and experiences, they can reshape their internal models, thus influencing future decisions via learned predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:00">[31:00]</a>.
- **Responsibility for Change:** While individuals are not responsible for the initial models handed to them (constructed largely by caregivers during upbringing), they are accountable for their present models, which they can alter through exposure to diverse ideas and cultures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:00">[42:00]</a>.

### Free Will and Noise

The element of noise or stochasticity within neural processes can also be considered a source of free will. The brain's inherent variability in neuron firing patterns suggests non-deterministic behavior, introducing unpredictability which can manifest as free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:00">[45:00]</a>.

## Broader Implications

The discussion elucidates how foundational emotions and experiences are to the concept of free will:

- **Cultural and Social Influences:** Social interactions and cultural exposures fundamentally reshape brain wiring, reinforcing or altering perceptions of autonomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:00">[55:00]</a>.
- **Interconnectedness of Human Experience:** Barrett emphasizes that our nervous systems are inherently social, affecting each other profoundly, which implies a shared reality continuously influencing individual decisions related to free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:00">[59:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Free will, as interpreted through the lens of neuroscience, is a complex interplay of predictive processing, cultivated experience, and innate variability. The capacity to learn and adapt suggests room for guidance and autonomy, painting a nuanced picture of human volition that expands beyond deterministic or entirely autonomous theories of behavior.

Understanding how the brain orchestrates what we perceive as free will not only deepens insight into human cognition but encourages more empathetic inter-human connectivity in a shared social reality.

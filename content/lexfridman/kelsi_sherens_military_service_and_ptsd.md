**Kelsi Sheren**, a Canadian Forces veteran, served as an artillery gunner in Afghanistan at the age of 18. Her experiences during and after her military service highlight the profound impact of war on soldiers, both in terms of their mental health and their personal lives. Sheren's journey through post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) and her advocacy for veterans reflects a deep personal commitment to healing and to helping others do the same.

## Early Military Service

Sheren's military journey began in 2007 when she joined the Canadian Armed Forces. Her deployment to Afghanistan followed shortly after, marking the beginning of a life-altering experience.

> At a young age, Kelsi was tasked with operating and managing artillery guns, which are critical for support in military operations. These responsibilities exposed her to the intense realities of war, which would later contribute to her struggles with PTSD.

During her deployment, she faced significant challenges, including the loss of comrades and exposure to combat situations that left lasting psychological scars. The severity of her experiences is encapsulated in moments of high tension and devastating loss: 

> "I turned and looked to the left and on the right-hand side, across the road [...] I saw a big piece of a body fly through the air and land into the field and [...] all hell broke loose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:12">[01:44:12]</a>.

## The Impact of PTSD

Upon returning from active duty, Sheren experienced severe PTSD, a condition that affected nearly every aspect of her life. Her path to managing PTSD was hindered by inadequate preparation and support from the military during her service:

> "We are giving none of our soldiers proper mental health training...[and] we don't need to medicate you yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

Lacking adequate mental health support, Sheren turned to alternative therapies, including cannabis and, later, ayahuascaâ€”a psychedelic that has been recognized for its therapeutic potential in treating PTSD and depression.

## Finding Healing and Purpose

Sheren's encounter with ayahuasca was transformative, allowing her to confront deeply-rooted trauma and gain new perspectives on her experience:

> "Mama aya is real, and she takes no prisoners [...] she shows you exactly what you need to see to help yourself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

This experience became a pivotal moment in Sheren's healing journey, enabling her to shift from a life haunted by trauma to one driven by purpose and advocacy.

## Advocacy Through Brass and Unity

Driven by her personal experiences, Kelsi Sheren founded [[the_role_of_art_and_business_in_veteran_support | Brass and Unity]], a company that sells jewelry and accessories to support veterans and first responders. The company donates a significant portion of its proceeds to organizations that help individuals transition from military service to civilian life.

> "What Brass and Unity tries to do is [...] really bridge the gap with the civilian population and letting them know what we [veterans] kind of go through" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:31">[03:47:31]</a>.

Brass and Unity stands as a testament to Sheren's commitment to raising awareness and supporting those who have served. Her work not only aids others in their healing journeys but also helps promote public understanding of the complex challenges faced by veterans.

## Legacy and Lessons

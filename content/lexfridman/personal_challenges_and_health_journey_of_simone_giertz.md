This article explores her experience with a brain tumor and how it influenced her professional journey.

## The Diagnosis and Immediate Challenges

Simone Giertz discovered she had a brain tumor shortly after delivering a [TED Talk](https://www.ted.com/). It was her mother who noticed her swollen eyelid during the TED event, which led to Simone getting an MRI scan. The scan revealed a brain tumor the size of a golf ball, believed to have been growing since her teenage years. The discovery was shocking and terrifying, especially given that Simone had no prior significant symptoms such as seizures or cognitive issues<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[1:01:43]</a>.

## The Surgical and Treatment Journey

Simone underwent surgery to remove the tumor, which was intense and challenging. Despite the gravity of the situation, the recovery from surgery was surprisingly linear, with progress seen on a weekly basis<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:15">[1:06:15]</a>.

The subsequent radiation treatment was a different ordeal, primarily because of its non-linear nature and its debilitating effect. Simone experienced what she described as feeling high, akin to being under the influence of drugs, which turned out to be a side effect of a medication intended to prevent dementia during radiation<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:57">[1:07:57]</a>.

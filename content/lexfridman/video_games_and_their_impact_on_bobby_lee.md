Bobby Lee, a renowned stand-up comedian and podcaster, has often shared insights into his personal life and hobbies. One such interest that stands out is his love for video games, an interest that not only serves as entertainment but also as a means of escapism and personal growth.

## Elder Scrolls Series: A Favourite Pastime

Bobby Lee has expressed a profound affection for the Elder Scrolls series, particularly "Oblivion" and "Skyrim." He describes these games as his favorite, sharing that he has created multiple characters and completed the quests several times over. His enjoyment stems from the games’ open-world nature and the ability to "grind," which involves methodically collecting items and completing extensive tasks within the game. Bobby explains that he enjoys collecting items like the "blister wart mushroom" to create potions, an activity he compares to mindfully spending an entire day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38">[09:38]</a>.

### The Appeal of Open-World Games

Bobby Lee prefers open-world games because they allow the player to make choices and explore at their leisure, deviating from the linear path of other games. This aspect provides a sense of freedom and agency that he finds exhilarating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58">[09:58]</a>. For Bobby, the allure lies in the opportunity to immerse himself in a world where he can explore endlessly and engage with countless in-game activities.

## Escapism and Emotional Outlet

Video games are more than just a pastime for Bobby Lee—they are a vital form of escapism. Particularly during challenging times, video games provide an outlet to avoid dealing with difficult emotions. He mentions turning to games like "Stardew Valley," a farming simulation, to distract himself from real-life issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01">[07:01]</a>. This usage aligns with his humorous yet poignant acknowledgment of using humor and avoidance as defense mechanisms throughout his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:39">[39:39]</a>.

## A Virtual Reality Dream

Bobby Lee imagines the possibility of living in a virtual world like that of "Skyrim" through advancements in virtual reality. He and his interviewer joke about cohabitating in such a world, enjoying the landscapes and activities it offers. This whimsical thought extends to futuristic ideas about virtual realities becoming more lifelike and immersive, perhaps one day allowing people to truly live within these fantastical worlds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21">[09:21]</a>.

## Community and Connection

While discussing video games, Bobby Lee highlights how these digital worlds can also foster connections with others, whether through shared experiences in multiplayer games or simply bonding over mutual game interests.

## Conclusion

For Bobby Lee, video games are a multifaceted tool—they offer enjoyment, a break from reality, and a canvas for personal expression and connection. His reflections on video gaming underscore their significance in his life as a means of coping, entertainment, and community building, illustrating the broader impact video games can have on individuals in modern society.

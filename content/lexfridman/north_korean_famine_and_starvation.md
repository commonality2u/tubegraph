From 1994 to 1998, North Korea was engulfed in a tragic famine, a period marked by widespread starvation and severe food shortages that claimed the lives of an estimated 600,000 to 3 million people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This devastating event was primarily attributed to systemic mismanagement by the government under Kim Jong-il, who took over leadership after his father's death in 1994 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Causes and Conditions

Several factors contributed to the famine. The collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, which had been a major provider of aid to North Korea, left the country without crucial support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:04">[00:53:04]</a>. Additionally, the North Korean regime's refusal of international aid worsened the situation, as they structured a deliberate policy to maintain control by ensuring that starvation kept the population too weak to resist or contemplate rebellion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:29">[00:53:29]</a>.

The famine was exacerbated by North Korea's [[north_korean_propaganda_and_control | propaganda machinery]], which prohibited the use of terms like "famine" and "hunger" to prevent any implication of government failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Instead, it was euphemistically dubbed as the "Arduous March" or "March of Suffering" to mask the harsh realities faced by the populace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Living Conditions

During this period, many North Koreans lived without electricity, clean water, medical supplies, sanitation, and food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. The isolation of the country from the international community meant that there was very little information either coming into or exiting the nation, further sealing the suffering within its borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Human Cost

The famine had a catastrophic impact on the populace, driving people to unimaginable extremes such as [[hunger_and_famine | cannibalism]] for survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This degree of deprivation not only took a physical toll but also subjected individuals to profound psychological torment. Stories from the famine, including those of families being forced to make heart-wrenching decisions, continued to haunt those who lived through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. 

## Global Parallels

The North Korean famine draws a chilling parallel to other orchestrated famines in history, such as [[stalins_policies_and_their_consequences | Stalin's policies]], which caused the Holodomor in Ukraine, claiming millions of lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Both events illustrate how totalitarian regimes have utilized famine as a tool of oppression and control over their populations.

## Looking Ahead

Despite the passage of decades, North Korea's leadership under Kim Jong-un has once again signaled the possibility of a renewed "Arduous March," as poor economic conditions threaten another period of deprivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The specter of past suffering looms large, as does the continued resilience of the North Korean people, underscoring a desperate need for humanitarian attention and intervention.

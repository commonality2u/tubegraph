The Epic Games Store (EGS) launched with a significant objective: to disrupt the digital distribution industry by offering game developers a better revenue split than competitors like Steam. Instead of Steam’s 30% revenue cut, EGS proposed a 12% cut, drawing attention to what Epic perceived as an unjust standard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:08">[03:44:08]</a>.

## The Vision Behind Epic Games Store

The launch of EGS was not just about creating another store; it was about challenging the established norms and offering a fairer deal. Epic's founder, Tim Sweeney, explains the importance of creating competition in the marketplace to ensure industry health and innovation. By offering a larger share of revenue to developers, Epic aimed to support creators more effectively and encourage more innovative content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:08">[03:44:08]</a>.

## Criticisms and Challenges

While EGS has achieved considerable success in attracting developers and users with its revenue model, it has faced criticism on two main fronts:

1. **Launcher Interface and Features**: Users have criticized the EGS launcher for being “clunky” and lacking features that are well developed on platforms like Steam. The interface, as described by Epic itself, is not yet on par with the long-established standards set by Steam, which has had the benefit of more years and resources to refine its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

2. **Exclusive Contracts**: Epic has been criticized for securing exclusive contracts, which prevent certain games from being available on other platforms for a limited time. While this was a strategic move by Epic to drive competition and ensure unique offerings on their platform, it has drawn ire from certain sections of the gaming community, particularly those who prefer to keep their library on a single platform like Steam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:03">[03:56:03]</a>.

## The Road Ahead

Epic continues to refine its platform to enhance the user experience. Despite the criticisms, EGS remains committed to its vision of creating a competitive environment that benefits developers, reduces costs for consumers, and challenges the status quo set by monopolistic practices in the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:01">[03:58:01]</a>. Through these efforts, Epic aspires to improve the gaming ecosystem and foster a climate where innovative and high-quality games can thrive.

### Future Prospects and Industry Impact

Epic Games Store exemplifies Epic's broader mission: to create tools and technologies that benefit both creators and consumers across the gaming industry. As the store continues to evolve, its impact will likely push other digital distribution platforms to consider similar terms for developers, potentially leading to significant shifts in how digital sales platforms operate.

Epic's ongoing journey highlights a persistent pursuit of pushing industry boundaries and challenging entrenched monopolies to create a more equitable landscape for creators and players alike.

Vladimir Propp is heralded as a pivotal figure in the study of narrative structures, especially in the context of folklore and storytelling. His work, primarily the 1928 book *Morphology of the Folk Tale*, revolutionized how narratives are analyzed and understood. In this text, Propp introduced a framework of 31 "predicates," which he called "functions" or "units," that represent a sequential structure or formula underlying the tales of Russian folklore and beyond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## The 31 Functions of Propp

Propp's model outlines a series of narrative steps that many stories, particularly in Russian folklore, typically follow. These functions form a skeleton upon which tales are structured and provide insight into the collective consciousness shared across cultures:

1. **Absention**: A family member leaves the security of the home environment.
2. **Interdiction**: A warning or command is given to the hero not to take a certain action.
3. **Violation**: The hero violates the interdiction, setting the story in motion.
4. **Reconnaissance**: The villain attempts to gather knowledge to further their plot.

The structure culminates in traditional resolutions such as weddings or reconciliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>.

> The 31 functions identified by Propp have transcended their initial application in folklore and have been applied to various modern narrative forms, including television serials and movies, demonstrating their universality and enduring relevance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

## Propp's Impact on Modern Storytelling

Propp's analysis provides a lens for understanding the narrative structure that underlies not just folk tales, but also modern storytelling in different media. His concept of predicates (or functions) allows authors and analysts to deconstruct and examine the foundational elements of narrative frameworks. This understanding is applicable not only in literary analysis but also in the creation of new, compelling stories across media types including film and television.

## Philosophical and Cultural Significance

Propp's work is significant not only in the realm of narrative theory but also in terms of cultural and philosophical studies. By identifying common functional elements of stories, Propp offers a glimpse into the universal subconscious of societies and cultures. These "predicates" reflect a shared human experience and understanding, resonating through various cultural expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:03">[01:27:03]</a>.

## Vladimir Vapnik's Remarks on Vladimir Propp

In his conversation with Lex Fridman, Vladimir Vapnik frequently refers to Propp's influence when discussing the abstraction and recognition of narrative patterns, archetypes, and predicates. Vapnik draws parallels between Propp's descriptive approach to storytelling and discussions in data science and artificial intelligence, particularly the potential application to image recognition and algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Like Propp's predicates that construct narratives, Vapnik suggests that understanding the foundational predicates of human behavior and intelligence could enable better data models and learning algorithms. This reflects the idea that underlying structures are pivotal to both narrative frameworks and computational models of learning and intelligence.

In conclusion, Vladimir Propp's contributions to understanding story structures provide a profound tool for the analysis of narratives across cultures and technologies. His concept of narrative "predicates" continues to inform and inspire fields ranging from literary studies to artificial intelligence, underpinning the enduring symbiosis between story and structure.

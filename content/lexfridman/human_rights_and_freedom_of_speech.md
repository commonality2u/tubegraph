Human rights and freedom of speech are fundamental topics that span across various dimensions of society and governance. This article delves into the intricate relationships between these concepts, as discussed by Alex Gladstein, Chief Strategy Officer at the Human Rights Foundation, and Lex Fridman in a recent podcast episode.

## Understanding Human Rights

### Universal Human Rights

Alex Gladstein emphasizes several universal human rights that he believes should be inherent to all people. These include the right to [[freedom_of_speech|freedom of speech]], the freedom of assembly, freedom of belief, the freedom to participate in government, the right to privacy, and property rights. These are regarded as fundamental negative rights, which are basic human freedoms that should not be infringed by governments. Negative rights are liberties, whereas positive rights are considered entitlements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### The Importance of Negative Rights

Negative rights are crucial because authoritarian regimes can commit fraud by claiming to provide positive rights without ensuring negative liberties. This is often due to a lack of free speech or press freedom, enabling regimes to construct a "Potemkin village" of entitlements such as healthcare and education without true liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Core Rights and Their Significance

The most fundamental rights, according to Gladstein, are [[freedom_of_speech|free speech]] and property rights. These rights are seen as foundational, with many other rights being "downstream" from them. If [[free_speech_and_democracy|free speech]] is suppressed, a ripple effect can lead to the erosion of other rights. Historical examples where violations of these rights led to social and economic turmoil include regimes under Lenin, Stalin, Mao, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Freedom of Speech in the Digital Age

The digital age has introduced new complexities to the concept of [[freedom_of_speech_and_the_impact_of_cancel_culture|free speech]]. The emergence of social networks controlled by private companies raises questions about how much protection citizens have when communicating online. With increasing incidents of censorship and de-platforming, the distinction between government censorship and company policies becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### The Town Square Test

Gladstein refers to the "town square test" proposed by Soviet dissident Natan Sharansky: Can one publicly criticize their ruler without fear of retribution? In societies that fail this test, [[censorship_and_freedom_of_speech|censorship]] exists, limiting true free speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### The Role of Technology

While technology can empower individuals and enhance freedoms, it can also serve as a tool for [[free_speech_and_censorship|censorship]] and surveillance. The balance between technological advancement and maintaining human rights is delicate. For instance, the use of big data by authoritarian regimes poses significant threats to civil liberties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.

## Conclusion

In conclusion, human rights and freedom of speech are interconnected pillars of a free society. Protecting and promoting these rights, especially in the context of technological advancements and globalization, remains a critical challenge. The work of activists like Alex Gladstein highlights the importance of vigilance and advocacy to ensure these rights are not only upheld but also adapted to the changing digital landscape.

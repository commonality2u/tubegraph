## The Seed of an Idea

The idea for Wikipedia emerged from the growth of the free software movement and the collaborative nature of open source software. [[Jimmy Wales]], co-founder of Wikipedia, observed how programmers collaborated by sharing code under a free license, which empowered new ways of working together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This observation led Wales to imagine how such collaboration could extend beyond software to other cultural works, such as an encyclopedia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Newpedia: The Academic Approach

Before Wikipedia, there was Newpedia, an initiative that aimed to create an encyclopedia through an even more rigorous academic process than traditional encyclopedias. It implemented a seven-stage review process to ensure accuracy and respect. However, the process was cumbersome and slow, leading to issues such as plagiarism even after the academic review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The Birth of Wikipedia

Frustrated with the slow progress, Wales explored a more dynamic approach. The concept of a "wiki" was introduced to him by Larry Sanger and another employee, Jeremy Rosenfeld. Inspired by the potential of wikis to foster rapid and collaborative creation, Wikipedia was launched in January <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Unlike Newpedia, Wikipedia allowed contributors to instantly publish and edit content, significantly increasing productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Initially intended as a complementary project to Newpedia, Wikipedia quickly outpaced its predecessor. Within two weeks of its launch, Wikipedia had accomplished far more than Newpedia had in almost two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## The Wiki Software and Interface Evolution

The initial software used to run Wikipedia was UseModWiki, chosen for its simplicity—it was just a single Perl script. Despite its simplicity, the software lacked vital features such as user accounts and better text formatting options, which were added later to secure unique identities and improve user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The early days also saw adaptations like replacing ugly camel-case links with neatly formatted links using square brackets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Philosophical Foundations

Wikipedia's purpose is to summarize the sum of all human knowledge. Early debates defined the boundaries of what constituted an encyclopedia entry, leading to projects like WikiSource for source texts to keep Wikipedia focused on summaries and discussions of topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

The continual philosophical and technical discussions led to defining key principles like neutrality, which remains a cornerstone of Wikipedia's editorial policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Expansion and Impact

As of May 2023, the English Wikipedia alone boasts 6.66 million articles across a vast range of topics, with content translated into hundreds of languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. Wikipedia has undeniably become one of the most significant sources of free information ever created, maintained by a community of volunteers who continue to build upon Wales’s original vision.

## Challenges and Community

Throughout its growth, Wikipedia has faced numerous challenges in maintaining content accuracy and neutrality. Community debate is crucial, sometimes involving heated discussions about controversial topics and how they are represented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. Despite these challenges, Wikipedia's model allows anyone with internet access to improve the world's repository of knowledge, making it a highly democratic tool for education. 

## Conclusion

Wikipedia’s development from an optimistic idea inspired by open collaboration into the world's largest encyclopedia is a testament to human cooperation and the power of freely shared knowledge. Its continued evolution reflects its adaptable philosophy and the persistent effort of its global community.

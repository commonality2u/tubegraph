The conversation with Kelsey Sharon, a Canadian Forces veteran and artillery gunner who served in Afghanistan, provides a deep insight into the profound impact of war on soldiers. Sharon, who served at the young age of 18, returned with severe PTSD and founded Brass In Unity, a company dedicated to supporting veterans and first responders through the sale of jewelry, with proceeds directed to their rehabilitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Historical Context and Personal Connection

Sharon highlighted the significant influence of studying history on her life, mentioning how her grandfather, a World War II vet, rarely spoke about his experiences. This silence, she believes, kept her from understanding the value of human stories and historical lessons fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The lack of dialogue with World War II veterans, who often sought to protect their families from the harsh truths of war, meant that many lessons and personal strengths inherent in overcoming such adversity were not passed down.

## The Personal Impact of War

Serving in Afghanistan, Sharon encountered the brutal reality of modern warfare, which often results in substantial civilian casualties. This realization contrasted sharply with her earlier conceptual understanding of war and spurred her deeper obsession with history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. She reflected on the complexities of human psychology, particularly the allure and danger of charismatic leaders in conflict, which she discussed in relation to figures like Hitler and Stalin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

## Encounter with Evil and Personal Reflection

The conversation delved into the philosophical considerations of evil and human nature, especially in the context of World War II and contemporary conflicts. The discussion explored whether individuals, if placed in historical contexts, would have acted differently or similarly to those who followed tyrannical leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Effects of Deployment on Soldiers

Sharon recounted her experiences leading up to and during her deployment, highlighting the chaotic nature of military life and the eventual emotional toll it takes. The adrenaline and training are quickly overshadowed by the harsh realities of war, as evidenced by her vivid description of an intense combat scenario where a comrade was lost to an IED <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:52">[01:48:52]</a>.

The conversation illuminated the disconnect between the publicâ€™s perception of heroism and the raw, often traumatic experiences of soldiers who have seen combat. Sharon's storytelling paints a picture of a soldier's life, fraught with danger, split-second decisions, and the resulting trauma that lingers long after returning to civilian life.

## The Psychological Toll and Path to Recovery

Post-deployment, Sharon faced a new battle with PTSD, a common affliction affecting many veterans. Her journey involved grappling with severe depression, utilizing different therapeutic approaches, including traditional methods and psychedelic treatments, to find peace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:59">[02:57:59]</a>.

She also emphasized the importance of community and conversation in healing, advocating for more comprehensive mental health resources within the military to assist soldiers both during and after service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:17">[03:11:17]</a>.

## Conclusion

The discussion with Kelsey Sharon underscores the multidimensional impact of war on soldiers, from their initial entry into a conflict zone to the prolonged psychological battles they endure long after the physical war has ended. It is a stark reminder of the sacrifices made by those who serve and the ongoing need for societal support systems to help them transition back into civilian life and heal from the unseen scars of war.

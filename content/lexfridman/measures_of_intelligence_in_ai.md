The discussion of measuring intelligence in artificial intelligence (AI) revolves around defining what intelligence entails and determining how it can be adequately assessed in machines. This involves drawing distinctions between various types of intelligence and developing tests that can accurately measure these capabilities in AI systems.

## Defining Intelligence

Francois Chollet, a prominent figure in the AI community, has advanced the discussion on AI intelligence measurement through his paper titled "On the Measure of Intelligence." He proposes that intelligence should not be perceived merely as a collection of skills or knowledge that a system possesses. Instead, it should be viewed as the efficiency with which an AI system can acquire new skills and adapt to new tasks that it has not encountered before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:24">[00:23:24]</a>.

According to Chollet, intelligence is displayed when a system can generalize and improvise in novel environments, adapting its knowledge and skills to unprecedented situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. This ability to adapt efficiently reflects the complexity and depth of its cognitive processes more effectively than merely exhibiting a high level of performance on specific tasks.

## The Role of Benchmarks

Current AI advancements, as seen with models like GPT-3, exhibit remarkable progress in generating plausible text or completing specific tasks. These models are trained extensively on vast datasets, allowing them to perform well within those pre-defined contexts. However, the challenge lies in determining how these capabilities reflect true intelligence rather than just pattern recognition and replication from their training data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

## Principles for AI Intelligence Tests

Chollet outlines several principles that any adequate test of AI intelligence should embody:

- **Explicit Priors:** Tests should clearly state the knowledge and assumptions that are necessary to understand and complete the tasks. These priors should align with basic human cognitive biases if the goal is to compare human and machine intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>.

- **Novelty Requirement:** Tasks should be novel, ensuring they have not been directly encountered in the system's experience. This prevents mere memorization and ensures the test reflects generalization and learning capabilities rather than pre-set skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>.

## The ARC Challenge

The Abstraction and Reasoning Corpus (ARC) is an initiative led by Chollet aimed at creating a test environment that embodies these principles. ARC tasks are designed to require the application of basic principles of reasoning, such as objectness, agentness, and geometry, without relying on external knowledge or pre-defined rules. The focus is on visual grids in which systems must transform inputs to outputs based on implicit rules derived from few-shot learning scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:35">[01:44:35]</a>.

ARC plays a significant part in evaluating AI's ability to perform tasks similar to human intelligence while maintaining explicitness about the needed priors. It highlights the limitations of current systems and enables researchers to focus on areas lacking in current AI models.

## Future of AI Intelligence Measurement

The ongoing development of intelligence assessments for AI continues to challenge researchers in understanding the scope and limits of machine intelligence. The goal is to achieve [[achieving_general_artificial_intelligence | General Artificial Intelligence (AGI)]], where systems are not only trained to complete specific tasks but are capable of learning and adapting to novel scenarios in ways that are currently characteristic only of human intelligence.

The pursuit involves reassessing core assumptions and continuously refining methods and benchmarks that reflect the true measure of intelligence in AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>.

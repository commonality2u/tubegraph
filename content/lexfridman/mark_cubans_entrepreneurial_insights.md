## Key Characteristics of a Great Entrepreneur

Cuban emphasizes that a great entrepreneur is someone who is curious and committed to continuous learning because business is ever-changing. An entrepreneur must also be agile, adapting swiftly to new information and changes in the environment. Moreover, being able to sell is crucial, as no business survives without sales. Cuban describes selling as helping others, and his approach to selling has always been about understanding the needs of the person and providing them with a solution. He illustrates this with his childhood experience selling garbage bags door to door by asking potential customers simple questions about their needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

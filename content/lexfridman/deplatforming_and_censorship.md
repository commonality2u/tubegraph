Deplatforming and censorship have emerged as significant phenomena in contemporary discourse, particularly in the realms of academia, social media, and public speech. These practices involve actions that silence or restrict speech, often leading to various societal and cultural repercussions.

## Definition and Dynamics

**Deplatforming** refers to efforts, often organized campaigns, aimed at removing individuals or groups from platforms where they can express their views. This can occur through methods such as getting individuals **fired, expelled, or de-platformed** from speaking engagements or digital platforms. These actions are typically targeted at speech that, while controversial, would usually be protected by the [[free_speech_and_censorship | First Amendment]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The increase in deplatforming efforts became notable around 2014, with campaigns often spearheaded by activists seeking to restrict certain types of speech. These campaigns often thrive on **group polarization**, wherein people become more entrenched in their views when censored, as they tend to discuss these views only with those who already agree with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Effects on Knowledge and Society

Censorship, in the form of deplatforming, can lead to **preference falsification**, where a society ends up with an inaccurate picture of people's true beliefs and opinions. This distortion occurs because individuals may refrain from sharing their true thoughts due to fear of repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Furthermore, deplatforming can exacerbate **cultural divisions and amplify polarization**. By driving censored opinions underground, individuals are not persuaded to change their minds but rather encouraged to retreat into more radical pockets that may reinforce and harden their views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Legal and Cultural Considerations

While deplatforming actions may not always involve direct government censorship, they often occur in contexts where **governmental free speech protections** like the First Amendment do not directly apply, such as private companies and universities. Yet, these actions still raise significant concerns about **free speech culture** and its vitality within a democratic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

Organizations like the Foundation for Individual Rights and Expression (FIRE) continuously advocate for free speech, emphasizing that true freedom of speech encompasses even those views we may personally despise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This broad understanding of free speech is essential in avoiding a repressively homogenized culture where only certain viewpoints are allowed to thrive.

## The Role of Higher Education

Higher education institutions often become battlegrounds for these issues, as they serve as microcosms where societal tensions around speech and censorship play out. The tendency towards **low viewpoint diversity** in academia exacerbates the situation, as environments dominated by a single ideology can foster practices that undermine free exchange of ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>.

Administrators and faculty play crucial roles in shaping these dynamics, sometimes encouraging or discouraging behaviors that lead to deplatforming and censorship, further influencing the cultural atmosphere both inside and outside the campus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.

## Combatting Censorship

To mitigate the impacts of deplatforming and censorship, fostering a **culture of openness and rigorous debate** is vital. Encouraging dialogue, promoting curiosity, and maintaining a commitment to understanding varied perspectives are essential practices for both educational institutions and society at large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:56">[02:27:56]</a>.

As the debate continues, the challenge remains to balance the right to free speech with the need to foster environments that are inclusive and respectful while allowing robust intellectual clashes to play their crucial role in societal progress.

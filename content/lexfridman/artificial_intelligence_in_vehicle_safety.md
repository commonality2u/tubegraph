Artificial intelligence (AI) plays a pivotal role in enhancing vehicle safety, especially in the context of [[ai_and_machine_learning_in_autonomous_driving | autonomous driving]]. Chris Gertie, a professor at Stanford University, has extensively studied how AI can be integrated into both race cars and public road vehicles to perform at or beyond human levels of driving capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Technological Innovations

One prominent example of AI-driven vehicle innovation is the autonomous race car, Shelly, developed at Stanford. Shelly has been fine-tuned to achieve speeds of up to 120 miles per hour on a racetrack, exceeding the capabilities of even expert human drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The approach used combines physics calculations with [[machine_learning_and_deep_learning_in_autonomous_vehicles | machine learning algorithms]] to maximize the use of tire friction and adapt to changing conditions like tire temperature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Policy and Regulatory Challenges

Gertie highlights the regulatory challenges posed by AI and automated vehicles. In the United States, vehicle safety regulations are based on a system of federal motor vehicle safety standards which currently do not directly address automation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Manufacturers self-certify their compliance with safety standards, contrasting with pre-market certification required in other industries like aviation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

To address these challenges, the US Department of Transportation rolled out a federal automated vehicle policy encouraging manufacturers to follow a voluntary safety assessment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. This assessment includes the definition of an "operational design domain" that specifies where and under what conditions an automated vehicle is intended to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Ethical Considerations

The ethical dilemmas surrounding AI in vehicle safety include deciding the appropriate course of action in potential crash scenarios, commonly illustrated by the "trolley problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Gertie argues that such decisions will likely be governed by engineering principles focused on reducing risk rather than philosophical debates on morality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

## Data Sharing

Data sharing is crucial for the advancement of AI in vehicle safety. Sharing information on edge-case scenarios and anomalies can enhance the training of AI systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>. However, this must be balanced with privacy and intellectual property concerns. Successful examples of data sharing in other sectors, such as aviation, provide a model for what might be achieved in the automotive field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>.

> The aviation industry's Esaias system shows a successful model of anonymized data sharing that improved safety. This concept can be adapted for vehicle safety to accelerate AI advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>.

## Future Opportunities

The ongoing development of AI in vehicle safety represents a significant opportunity not only for improving the safety of automated and autonomous systems but also for maintaining the United States' leadership in this transformative technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>. As AI-driven vehicles become more prevalent, addressing the policy, ethical, and data-sharing aspects will be critical in ensuring these technologies are safely integrated into society.

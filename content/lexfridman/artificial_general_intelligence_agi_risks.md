Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) is a concept that represents the goal of creating machines with the ability to perform any intellectual task that a human can. The prospect of achieving AGI carries with it profound potential but also significant risks.

## Understanding AGI Risks

The potential risks associated with AGI center on the possibility that such intelligence could surpass human capabilities and become uncontrollable. The narrative often depicted includes scenarios where an AGI could devise goals misaligned with human safety or existence, leading to [[artificial_intelligence_and_future_risks | catastrophic outcomes]]. As Michael Littman suggests, some very smart people have expressed concern about this potential threat:

## Debate Among Experts

Experts remain divided on the likelihood and timing of achieving AGI, as well as the severity of its risks. Some futurists, including [[discussions_on_the_future_of_artificial_general_intelligence_agi | Elon Musk and Sam Harris]], highlight worries about summoning a "demon" that we might not control, pushing policymakers to focus on AI risks. However, others, like Littman, are less concerned about the immediate threat:

> "I am not particularly moved by the idea that if we’re not careful, we will accidentally create a super intelligence that will destroy human life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06">[20:06]</a>.

## Technological Momentum

The discussion about AGI risks often references historical and current technological developments, such as the success of [[artificial_general_intelligence | AlphaZero]] and other AI systems that continue to improve without clear limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>.

This sentiment echoes concerns about the potential exponential growth of AI capabilities outstripping our ability to manage them effectively.

## Conclusion

While AGI presents an exciting frontier in artificial intelligence, the corresponding risks necessitate careful consideration. Balancing the aggressive pursuit of AGI with the potential societal and ethical impacts is crucial. As pointed out during the conversation, the key to safely developing AGI may lie in ensuring that mechanisms for human interaction and control are deeply integrated into the design of these systems. This might be the approach necessary to mitigate [[challenges_in_developing_safe_and_beneficial_agi | challenges in developing safe and beneficial AGI]] and prevent undesirable consequences.

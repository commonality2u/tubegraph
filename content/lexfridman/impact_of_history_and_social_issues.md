In a thought-provoking conversation with [[the_impact_of_social_media_on_society | Lex Fridman]], Yay—formerly known as Kanye West—dives deep into the impact of history and social issues on contemporary society, as part of the Lex Fridman podcast. This dialogue underscores the complex interplay between the past and present, as well as the potential consequences for future generations.

## The Role of History in Education

Yay argues against the traditional teaching of history in schools, positing that education should focus on engineering and practical skills rather than subjective historical narratives. He suggests that history is often written by the victors, which can lead to biased interpretations that do not serve the present needs of society:

> "The only thing that we really need to teach in school is engineering. We don't need to teach history... history was just written by the victors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

He questions the usefulness of history, suggesting that focusing too much on past events can hinder progress and innovation:

> "The biggest mistake from the past that we keep making is looking at the past too much, giving too much value to the past" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## The Impact of Social Issues

Social issues, particularly those affecting the African American community, are central to Yay's concerns. He highlights the systemic issues that have historically affected Black communities, such as the legacy of slavery and the socio-economic challenges that continue to this day:

> "African Americans are not choosing to get the abortion. I mean, it's a choice, it's an individual choice, but we're being influenced too" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:40">[02:01:40]</a>.

Yay also touches on the role of media in shaping these social issues, emphasizing how certain narratives can perpetuate systemic problems while others can mislead or polarize society:

> "BLM took a black person, showed his death on camera... because 14, 20 kids get killed in Chicago every week and it's not spread that much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:38">[02:39:38]</a>.

## Reevaluating Historical Narratives

Yay suggests that history, as it is currently taught and understood, often omits significant perspectives, particularly those of marginalized communities. He calls for a reevaluation of historical narratives to include a broader spectrum of voices and experiences:

> "It's almost impossible to find a movie about Mansa Musa when you go to the African history museum in Washington DC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a>.

## Engineering as a Solution

Throughout the discussion, Yay advocates for the role of engineering as a unifying and practical field that can address contemporary challenges. He suggests that engineering can transcend historical biases and help create a more equitable and efficient society:

> "We need to teach engineering because it's something that is factual and counts in the now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This focus on engineering reflects Yay's belief in the potential for technological advancements to address and solve socio-economic issues within society, aligning with ideas related to [[political_and_social_implications_of_technological_advancements]].

## Conclusion

Yay's conversation with Lex Fridman offers a unique perspective on the intersection of history and social issues, urging a shift from historical narratives towards practical, engineering-based education. He challenges listeners to rethink the value placed on historical learning and emphasizes the potential of engineering and social innovation to drive meaningful change in society.

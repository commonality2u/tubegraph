Longterm thinking is an essential principle that can serve as a significant lever to address humanity's grand challenges. It enables us to solve problems that are impossible to tackle when constrained by short-term perspectives. As Jeff Bezos suggests, humanity's impact on the planet and each other has reached a scale where our actions have profound long-term consequences, such as climate change and environmental degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## The 10,000 Year Clock

A symbol of long-term thinking can be found in the 10,000 Year Clock, a project envisioned by [[Danny Hillis]] and supported by [[Jeff Bezos]]. This monumental clock is designed to tick once a year, chime once every hundred years, and see its cuckoo emerge every thousand years. It is housed inside a mountain in West Texas and is intended to operate without human intervention for 10,000 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

> The clock aims to serve as a metaphor for long-term contemplation and a catalyst to widen humanity's thinking horizons beyond the typical corporate or political timelines that tend to stretch only five years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## The Importance of Long-term Thinking

Long-term thinking allows us to tackle significant challenges, like [[existential_risks_and_future_of_humanity | existential risks and the future of humanity]]. By extending our time horizon, we can devise strategies that are robust enough to cope with unforeseen consequences and complex problems. For instance, thinking in terms of decades or centuries rather than years can lead to the development of sustainable technologies and societal systems that better accommodate the earth's limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Influencing Future Generations

Bezos emphasizes that the 10,000 Year Clock is less about immediate impact and more about influencing future generations to consider long-term implications in their decision-making processes. It speaks to the profound potential of empowering future entrepreneurs and leaders with a mindset oriented toward extended foresight and responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:52">[02:08:52]</a>.

## Relevance to Blue Origin

In his vision for space exploration through Blue Origin, Bezos hopes to lay down the necessary infrastructure for space travel and colonization, thus contributing to the [[possible_future_of_humanity_and_civilization | possible future of humanity and civilization]] by ensuring that the human race can survive beyond the Earth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. As he highlights, the development of a space-faring civilization requires long-term investment and focus, similar to the incremental developments that made the internet a realm of dynamism and opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:12">[00:45:12]</a>.

In summary, promoting a culture of long-term thinking is not just about addressing the immediate issues but also about preparing the groundwork for future advancements and innovations. As civilization continues to grow in complexity, it becomes increasingly crucial to adopt strategies that extend our foresight and ensure the survival and flourishing of humanity for millennia to come.

Poker, a game deeply ingrained in the fabric of gambling culture, has undergone significant transformations, especially with technological advancements that have permeated the game. One of the pivotal developments in modern poker is the introduction and widespread use of **solvers**, which have dramatically altered both the way the game is played and understood.

## The Traditional Era

Before the arrival of solvers, poker was a game learned primarily through experience and intuition. Players honed their skills at the table, often jotting down hands on a notepad to analyze later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Mastery required a blend of innate talent and card sense, as [Phil Ivey](https://lexfridman.com) exemplified, with many players needing to develop astute observational and strategic skills without the aid of computerized analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:01">[00:57:01]</a>.

## The Advent of Solvers

The landscape of poker began to shift with the rise of **solvers**—programs that use artificial intelligence to analyze game strategies and suggest optimal plays. These tools offer players insights into the mathematically and strategically best way to play given standard poker situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:32">[01:00:32]</a>.

### How Solvers Work

Solvers enumerate all possible hand combinations, betting actions, and possible outcomes to determine the strategy that maximizes expected value (EV). They operate by dissecting each possible scenario using a Game Theory Optimal (GTO) approach, presenting players with a set of actions that cannot be exploited by any opponent strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

## The Impact of Solvers on the Game

### Strategic Depth and Learning

Solvers have introduced a new level of depth to the game, enabling players to understand complex strategic concepts not through trial and error, but through mathematical certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:57">[01:00:57]</a>. This has significantly shortened the learning curve for many up-and-coming players, making the path to becoming a competitive player more accessible than in previous generations.

### Game Theory Optimal (GTO) vs. Exploitative Play

GTO strategies, as informed by solvers, focus on achieving equilibrium where a player's strategy is optimal and resistant to exploitation. Yet, top players like [[Phil Ivey]] and [[Daniel Negreanu]] blend these insights with exploitative play, adjusting their strategies based on opponents' tendencies rather than just adhering rigidly to GTO principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:11">[00:37:11]</a>.

## The Future of Poker with Solvers

The presence of solvers has democratized access to high-level strategies, reshaping the competitive landscape of poker. However, it continues to raise questions about the balance between human intuition and machine-aided decision-making. The challenge and beauty of poker remain in the blending of these elements—balancing the resolver's data-driven approach with the player's personal insights and experience.

As poker continues to evolve with technological integration, it promises to remain a game of strategic depth and psychological intrigue, where the human touch is forever indispensable.

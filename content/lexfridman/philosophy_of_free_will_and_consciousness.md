## Introduction
The relationship between [[free_will_and_consciousness_in_philosophy_and_theology | free will]] and consciousness has been a longstanding topic of inquiry within both philosophy and science. It raises fundamental questions about human nature, responsibility, and our understanding of reality. In a recent conversation, Scott Aaronson, a professor of computer science, delved into these philosophical questions while emphasizing the importance of aligning them with empirical research.

## The Interplay Between Philosophy and Science
Aaronson argues that philosophy deals with some of the biggest questions that humans can ask, such as whether we are living in a simulation or if the future is determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. These philosophical inquiries can often seem metaphysically unanswerable, yet they provide the motivation for scientific exploration. According to Aaronson, math and science are tools essential for making progress in these fields, capable of reframing and resolving philosophical questions in innovative ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Asking the Right Questions
Aaronson suggests that philosophical questions should often be replaced with more tractable, empirical ones that capture their essence but are more amenable to scientific inquiry. He refers to this as replacing the philosophical question "Q" with a more scientifically approachable "Q Prime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>. As an example, instead of getting bogged down in debates about the existence of free will, we could ask how well a person's actions could be predicted within the constraints of physical laws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

## Free Will and Predictability
One of the interesting discussions around free will is the extent to which behavior could be predicted. Aaronson discusses various levels of predictability, from Laplace's demon, which posits perfect predictability through knowledge of the universe's state, to the limitations posed by quantum mechanics, which might introduce an element of probabilistic unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>. This venture into the realms of [[consciousness_and_the_philosophy_of_mind | quantum mechanics]] links the debate to the heart of empirical science.

## Consciousness and Free Will
The role of consciousness in the experience and reality of free will further complicates these discussions. Free will isn't just about the external predictability of actions but also about the internal experience of making choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:33">[00:24:33]</a>. This introduces subjective elements that scientific methods struggle to encapsulate fully, highlighting the importance of a multidisciplinary approach.

## Conclusion
In the conversation, Aaronson emphasizes that scientists, whether they are computer scientists, mathematicians, or physicists, should indeed care about philosophy, as philosophical queries often form the backdrop for scientific exploration. Despite its theoretical nature, philosophy offers powerful lenses through which to interpret empirical data and re-evaluate scientific paradigms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> While the questions of free will and consciousness remain deeply philosophical, the integration of empirical scientific methodologies provides a potentially illuminating path forward. Philosophical exploration paired with scientific rigor may yet offer insights into these persistently enigmatic aspects of human experience.

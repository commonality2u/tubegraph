## Early Beginnings

Carlsen's journey in chess began somewhat later than his peers; he started playing competitively at the age of eight and a half, while many had years of experience by then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:58">[01:55:58]</a>. Despite this, he quickly rose to prominence, demonstrating a natural ability and passion for the game that set him apart.

## Achievements and Milestones

By age 11, Carlsen was already making waves in the chess community. His significant win at the Norwegian Championship for his age group underscored his potential, marking the first time he felt he could be the best among his peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:20">[01:57:20]</a>. His rise in the chess rankings was rapid, cementing his status as a prodigy.

Carlsen became the world's youngest grandmaster in 2004 and quickly climbed the ranks to become the number one player in the world by the age of 19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>. His extended period as the world number one since the summer of 2011 is a testament to his consistency and dominance in the game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:04">[01:09:04]</a>.

## World Championships

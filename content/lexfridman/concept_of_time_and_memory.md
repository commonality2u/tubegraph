The intertwining nature of time and memory has long intrigued scientists and thinkers alike. During a fascinating conversation between Sarah Walker, an astrobiologist and theoretical physicist, and Lee Cronin, a chemist, the complexities of time and memory were explored with a particular interest in how these concepts relate to life, consciousness, and the universe.

## Time as a Fundamental Aspect of the Universe

Walker and Cronin delved into the nature of time, discussing its role as a foundational aspect of the universe. Walker suggests that the universe is continuously creating states, which she equates to time, separate from space. This process of creating states eyes the formation of memories—a crucial component of [[human_memory_and_the_act_of_remembering]]—and contributes to the universe's evolution from mere existence to a memory-laden phenomena we recognize as life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

## Memory and the Causal Chain

In their discussion, Walker and Cronin emphasize the importance of memory in understanding life and the universe. Memory, they propose, is not just an abstract concept but a physical aspect embedded within objects through time. This idea echoes the notion that memory is a tangible, causally influential component of reality, aligning with the philosophical and scientific inquiries into the [[concept_of_time]] and reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

## Assembly Theory and Memory

Assembly theory, a concept developed by Cronin and Walker, provides a framework to understand how objects, particularly living ones, carry the history of their assembly through time. This theory posits that life and memory are encoded in the structure of an object, which is constructed over time from simpler parts into more complex forms. It suggests that the more complex the structure, the more "memory" is embedded within it, a concept comparable to the [[hierarchical_temporal_memory]] approach in artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.

## Time, Memory, and Curiosity

The concept of time is deeply tied to human curiosity and our understanding of the universe. Walker asserts that time provides a path for the universe to explore possibilities, making life a significant player in this exploration. Similarly, memory, as the record of these explorations, shapes our understanding of reality and the potential future. This aligns with themes explored in discussions about the [[nostalgia_and_memorys_role_in_shaping_time_perception]], as memory serves as a conduit for understanding the past and influencing the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

In the dialogue between Sarah Walker and Lee Cronin, the concept of time and memory emerged as central themes in understanding life and the universe. Their insights reveal a universe that is not only expanding in space but also in its capacity to create memories and explore possibilities. This exploration of time and memory highlights the profound interconnectedness of life, consciousness, and the cosmos, as we continue to uncover the mysteries of our universe through the lens of memory and its assembly across time.

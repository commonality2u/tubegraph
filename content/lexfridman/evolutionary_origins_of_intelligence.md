Understanding the origins of intelligence, especially in humans, is a complex endeavor that intertwines with numerous scientific disciplines, including neuroscience, anthropology, and evolutionary biology. Jeff Hawkins, a renowned neuroscientist, has contributed significantly to this discourse, offering insights into how intelligence may have evolved and how it functions within the human brain.

## Introduction to Jeff Hawkins' Theory

Jeff Hawkins, author of notable works including "On Intelligence" and "A Thousand Brains," presents compelling theories about the structure and function of intelligence in the human brain. His work, particularly in "A Thousand Brains," introduces the concept of the neocortex functioning as a series of thousands of independent, yet cooperative, modeling systems, challenging traditional views of how knowledge and intelligence are structured in the brain.

## The Role of Movement in the Evolution of Intelligence

A key point in Hawkins' theory is the proposal that the evolution of intelligence began with the mobility of organisms. As soon as living beings started moving, there was evolutionary pressure for them to move intelligently—whether it was to find food, avoid danger, or locate mates. This laid the foundation for developing complex neural mechanisms capable of mapping environments, creating a framework for more sophisticated models of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:06">[23:06]</a>.

> The ability to map one's environment is linked to the hippocampus and the entorhinal cortex, which are ancient parts of the brain responsible for spatial awareness and navigation. These faculties were crucial in the evolutionary ladder, setting the stage for the development of more advanced cognitive processes.

## The Neocortex and Its Evolutionary Mechanisms

The neocortex is the most evolved part of the human brain and is pivotal in the development of high-level intelligence. According to Hawkins, the neocortex contains about 150,000 cortical columns, each acting as an independent modeling system capable of learning and predicting the environment's structure through sensory inputs and movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36">[10:36]</a>. This "Thousand Brains Theory" suggests that intelligence emerges as a collective consensus from these independent models reaching a consensus through hierarchical voting mechanisms.

### Reference Frames and Prediction

Hawkins discusses the critical role of reference frames in understanding how the brain predicts sensory experiences. This model is analogous to how architects use reference frames to predict a building’s appearance from different angles. In the brain, similar mechanisms allow for predicting outcomes of actions, facilitating learning and memory formation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:04">[43:04]</a>.

## Evolutionary Origins Hypothesis

The hypothesis put forward by Hawkins contemplates that the mechanism initially used for navigating spaces was generalized in evolution to become capable of modeling more abstract concepts. For example, neurons initially used for spatial mapping were adapted to build models of varied sensory and conceptual domains as the neocortex expanded and evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22">[24:22]</a>.

### The Connection to Modern AI

Hawkins' research into the biological mechanisms of intelligence also parallels developments in artificial intelligence. The insights from human brain structures provide both architectural and functional blueprints for AI systems, suggesting that true artificial intelligence could similarly benefit from the distributed and cooperative model Hawkins describes, leading to advances in the [[evolution_of_intelligence_and_consciousness_in_ai]].

## Knowledge Preservation and Future Prospects

In contemplating the impact of intelligence on humanity’s future, Hawkins posits that preserving human knowledge externally—beyond biological constraints—could ensure that such intelligence continues to benefit future organisms or civilizations, whether they are human, alien, or machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57">[00:57]</a>.

> If human civilization were to destroy itself, storing knowledge in a way that long outlives us can provide a legacy for future intelligent life, potentially millions of years forward or throughout the galaxy as technological surrogates for humanity’s intellectual endeavors.

In summary, the evolutionary origins of intelligence, as elucidated by Jeff Hawkins, offer a framework not only for understanding how human cognition and behavior evolved but also for designing future AI systems that may transcend our earthly limitations. These insights prompt us to not only look inward at the biological roots of intelligence but also outward to a future where knowledge and consciousness might be preserved and extended across the cosmos.

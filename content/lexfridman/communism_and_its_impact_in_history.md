Communism, as an ideology and movement, has had profound and far-reaching effects on global history, particularly throughout the 20th century. It is a subject often associated with significant historical events, radical shifts in governance, and influential figures such as [[role_and_impact_of_marxism | Karl Marx]], Vladimir Lenin, and others.

## Foundations of Communism

Communism is deeply rooted in the ideas of Karl Marx, who, alongside Friedrich Engels, outlined the premises of communist thought in works such as "The Communist Manifesto" and "Das Kapital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:02">[03:19:02]</a>. Marx's ideas revolve around the notion that history is a series of class struggles, proposing that these conflicts will ultimately lead to a society without class distinctions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Despite criticisms, Marx insisted upon the scientific nature of his ideas, positing an inevitable evolution towards a classless society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

## The Implementation of Communism

### Soviet Union

Communism was first widely implemented following the Russian Revolution of 1917, leading to the establishment of the Soviet Union under Lenin. This event was a direct outcome of the power vacuum created by World War I, rather than purely ideological grounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Lenin adapted Marxist theories to fit the Russian context, where industrialization was not as advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:04">[02:28:04]</a>.

### Economic Policies

One of the key policies implemented by Soviet leadership was the collectivization of agriculture, aimed at consolidating individual landholdings and labor into collective farms. However, this led to significant disruptions in traditional farming practices, resulting in famines and widespread suffering, especially in Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:20">[01:29:20]</a>.

## Global Impact of Communism

### China

In China, communism took a distinctly different path under Mao Zedong, who tailored Marxist philosophy to adapt to the largely rural and agrarian Chinese society by placing peasants at the forefront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:57">[02:31:57]</a>. The implementation of Mao's policies, such as the Great Leap Forward, was catastrophic, resulting in widespread famine and death <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

### Global Perspectives

Communism influenced the political landscape worldwide, from Eastern Europe to parts of Africa and Latin America, often spreading in the wake of [[the_rise_and_fall_of_the_soviet_union | Soviet influence]] and through various revolutionary movements. Its promise of classlessness and equality was appealing to many disillusioned with pre-existing capitalist structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:23">[01:17:23]</a>.

## Consequences and Criticisms

While communism brought about certain socioeconomic reforms, it also led to the establishment of totalitarian regimes characterized by severe repression, human rights abuses, and a lack of political freedom. The [[comparison_of_communism_and_capitalism | debate]] regarding the efficacy and ethical implications of communism compared to other systems, such as capitalism, continues to provoke significant ideological contention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.

## Conclusion: Legacy of Communism

The legacy of communism is complex and multifacetedâ€”marked by aspirations for equality and social justice, yet marred by authoritarianism and economic challenges. The [[historical_context_and_impact_of_communist_regimes_in_the_20th_century | impact of communist regimes]] has shaped current geopolitical realities and continues to be a subject of significant historical inquiry and debate. Despite its decline in practice, the ideals of communism remain influential in various political and academic discussions today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

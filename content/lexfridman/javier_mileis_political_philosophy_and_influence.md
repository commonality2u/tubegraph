## Background

Javier Milei, the President of Argentina, is known for his distinctive political philosophy and economic policies. As a self-identified [[michael_malices_anarchist_political_philosophy | anarcho-capitalist]] and [[michael_malices_anarchist_political_philosophy | libertarian]], Milei's approach to governance is rooted in minimizing the role of the state and maximizing individual freedoms. Prior to his presidency, Argentina faced severe economic challenges, including hyperinflation, a significant national debt, and widespread unemployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Economic Philosophy

Milei's economic philosophy centers on free-market principles. He seeks to eliminate state interference in markets, arguing that such intervention creates inefficiencies and stifles economic growth. He is inspired by the Austrian School of Economics and has been influenced by prominent figures such as Murray Rothbard, Ludwig von Mises, and Friedrich Hayek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Achievements in Office

In his first few months in office, Milei managed to achieve Argentina's first fiscal surplus in 16 years and significantly reduced inflation, demonstrating the potential efficacy of his economic policies. His administration is engaged in ongoing efforts to deregulate the economy, aiming to make Argentina the freest country globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Political Beliefs

### Anarcho-Capitalism and Libertarianism

Milei describes himself as an anarcho-capitalist, opposing the existence of a coercive state. He advocates for a society that respects individual life projects and property rights while adhering to the principle of non-aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Despite his idealist view, Milei adapts his policies to real-world constraints, identifying practically as a minarchist. This approach involves reducing the state to its minimal necessary functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### Cultural and Political Struggle

Milei actively fights against socialism and leftist ideologies, which he perceives as threats to individual freedom and economic prosperity. He regards power as a zero-sum game and believes that failing to engage in the political battle cedes control to those who support collectivist policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:52">[01:00:52]</a>.

## Influence and Criticism

Milei is often seen as a controversial figure, prompting both admiration and criticism. His radical reforms have faced pushback from established political entities and the media, yet he is unyielding in his pursuit of dismantling what he views as a corrupt and inefficient bureaucracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

### Relationship with Prominent Figures

Milei has established connections with influential global figures who share his views on freedom and deregulation, such as [[vitalik_buterins_influence_and_philosophy | Vitalik Buterin]], Elon Musk, and former U.S. President Donald Trump. These relationships underscore his commitment to fostering a global alliance of like-minded leaders to champion free-market capitalism and individual liberty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:08]</a>.

## Conclusion

Javier Milei represents a significant figure in the global libertarian movement, embodying the struggle for economic and political freedoms against entrenched government structures. His presidency in Argentina serves as a bold experiment in applying anarcho-capitalist principles within a national framework, with the potential implications stretching beyond Argentina's borders.

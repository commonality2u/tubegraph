Consciousness and decision making are two intertwined concepts that have fascinated scholars, scientists, and philosophers for ages. In a conversation with Annika Harris, author of *Conscious: A Brief Guide to the Fundamental Mystery of the Mind*, these complex ideas are explored, particularly in how consciousness contributes to the concept of free will and decision-making.

## The Illusion of Free Will

Harris opens the discussion by addressing the common perception of free will as an illusion—a psychological construct facilitated by consciousness. This construct allows individuals to believe that there is a separate self, independent of brain processing, that is responsible for decision making. Harris argues that this is largely illusory, as the feeling of conscious will may not genuinely drive behavior—it follows rather than leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Differentiating Free Will from Conscious Will

Harris emphasizes the need to distinguish between free will, defined as the decision-making processes of the brain, and conscious will, which is often perceived as the driver of behavior. While the brain processes decisions in complex, natural systems that can be labeled as free will, this isn't "free" in the sense traditionally believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Role of Intuition

The discourse then moves into the role of intuition in scientific advancement. Harris discusses shaking up intuitions as a way to advance understanding in fields like consciousness studies, where breakthroughs often occur when well-worn intuitions are challenged or re-evaluated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## The Process of Decision Making

Exploring further, she explains that while the brain is capable of myriad responses in decision making—from choosing between options to more complex behaviors like running out of a room screaming—the moment of decision is the culmination of countless influences and inputs. The apparent freedom in choice is an elaborate process of the brain as a natural system, not an unbound act of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>.

## Experiments and Studies

Harris discusses experiments that deal with the timing and perception of actions, suggesting that decision making is the product of brain processes occurring before conscious awareness. These experiments highlight the apparent lag between processing and the conscious experience of decision making, further challenging the idea of free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Consciousness and the Brain's Role

The conversation touches on whether studying the brain could provide insights into free will and consciousness. Harris acknowledges that neuroscience has already revealed facts pointing to errors in our intuitions about decision making and consciousness. As understanding deepens, these insights might reshape our concepts of both consciousness and decision making, potentially proving transformative at both a scientific and personal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a>.

## Philosophical and Ethical Implications

The philosophical implications of Harris’s perspective challenge traditional views on morality and self-perception. Recognizing consciousness as a potentially passive participant in decision making could influence ethical theories, personal responsibility, and approaches to mental health and well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:27">[01:22:27]</a>.

## Conclusion

Annika Harris’s insights offer a profound philosophical challenge: to reconsider the roles consciousness and decision-making play in our lives. They impel us to look beyond intuitive beliefs to understand our behaviors and decisions more authentically—an exploration that is bound to redefine not only how we view the mind but how we live within its constructs.

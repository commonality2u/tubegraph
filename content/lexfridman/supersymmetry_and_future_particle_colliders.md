Supersymmetry (SUSY) stands as one of the most compelling extensions to the Standard Model of particle physics, held in high regard not just for the elegance it brings but also for its potential to answer some of the pressing questions left unresolved by contemporary physics. One of its key promises is to address the fine-tuning problem related to the Higgs boson, and its hypotheses regarding dark matter offer intriguing avenues that future particle experiments, including the Large Hadron Collider (LHC) and its successors, aim to explore.

## The Promise of Supersymmetry

Supersymmetry posits a fundamental symmetry between two classes of particles: fermions, which make up matter, and bosons, which mediate forces. Essentially, SUSY predicts that each particle in the Standard Model has a superpartner with differing spin characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:28">[00:48:28]</a>. This transformative idea aims to resolve several critical issues:

1. **Hierarchy Problem**: Supersymmetry provides a mechanism by which the Higgs boson's mass is stabilized against the high energy scales that make its current mass peculiar without fine-tuning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:01">[00:50:01]</a>.

2. **Dark Matter**: It introduces candidates for dark matter particles, the lightest of which could be stable and non-interacting, matching the properties hypothesized for dark matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:12">[00:49:12]</a>.

Despite its elegance and potential, empirical evidence for supersymmetry has been elusive. Experiments conducted at the LHC, designed to probe these superpartners at energy levels hypothesized by SUSY, have yet to confirm their existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:38">[00:58:38]</a>.

## Future Prospects: Particle Colliders 

While the LHC has yet to observe supersymmetric particles, its role is far from over, with significant upgrades on the horizon set to increase both the collision rate and the precision of its measurements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:02">[01:18:02]</a>. Beyond the LHC, plans for next-generation particle colliders are underway, with aims to reach energies and precision levels unattainable by current technologies:

### Large Hadron Collider (LHC) Upgrades

The High-Luminosity Large Hadron Collider (HL-LHC) is the next phase, focusing on increasing the collision rate by an order of magnitude, enabling new data that might shine light on dark matter candidates or subtle effects predicted by theories like SUSY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>.

### Future Circular Collider (FCC)

The proposed Future Circular Collider is a conceptual leap designed to probe unprecedented energy levels around a 100 km circumference ring. The early phases of this project include the construction of an electron-positron collider to extensively study the Higgs boson, with the potential for deeper insights into SUSY by analyzing how Higgs behaves at higher energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>.

## Conclusion

While supersymmetry has not yet been detected, the framework remains a profound part of theoretical physics with implications that extend to our understanding of the cosmos, including dark matter and possibly even dark energy. The upcoming advancements in particle collider technologies promise to explore these theoretical realms further, making it an exciting time in the field as researchers continue their quest for the fundamental laws of the universe. Whether these insights will arrive with the next data cycle of existing colliders or await a future technological leap remains a tantalizing open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:56">[01:20:56]</a>.

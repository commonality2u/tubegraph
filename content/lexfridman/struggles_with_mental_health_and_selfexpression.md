## Importance of Therapy
Reynolds emphasizes the critical role therapy has played in his life and advocates for its destigmatization. By sharing his struggles and journey to find the right therapist, he underscores the notion that seeking help is a form of strength rather than weakness. Therapy serves not just as a place for self-examination but as a practice for mental maintenance akin to physical exercise.

> "My biggest emphasis of life is... mental health and destigmatizing therapy because for me I didn’t go to therapy for a long time because I felt that it would be admitting that I was broken..."

## Self-Expression through Music
Music is integral to Reynolds' self-expression, providing a platform to channel his feelings and experiences. His songwriting process is described as a form of journaling, where themes and emotions are explored organically without a preconceived notion of structure or theme. This unique process allows him to express complex emotions tied to his **mental health struggles**.

> "I never think opening... I don't have a theme in mind. I'm sitting down and I'm writing a journal entry."

## The Role of Pain in Art
Reynolds describes how pain, a recurrent theme in his music, serves as a catalyst for creating art that resonates on a deeper emotional level. The struggle and subsequent growth from pain are pivotal elements of his narrative and music.

> "The greatest things in my life have come from the deepest hurt… it's a basic concept that's been said a million times over in a million different ways but that's pretty much what I was trying to say with 'Believer.'"

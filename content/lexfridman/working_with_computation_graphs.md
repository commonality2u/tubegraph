Computation graphs are a fundamental concept in symbolic computation, allowing users to define, compile, and execute mathematical expressions efficiently. This article explores the principles and practices of working with computation graphs, focusing on their applications in automatic differentiation, optimization, and machine learning, particularly within the context of using computational frameworks like Tiano.

## Introduction to Computation Graphs

A computation graph is a directed acyclic graph that represents a mathematical expression. Nodes in the graph correspond to operations or variables, and edges represent the data flow between these operations. Computation graphs are integral to symbolic computation, enabling sophisticated optimizations, automatic differentiation, and other advanced operations that are essential in machine learning and deep learning.

### Components of a Computation Graph

**1. Nodes:**  
Each node in a computation graph represents a mathematical operation such as addition, multiplication, or functions like `sigmoid` or `softmax`. Nodes can also represent variables, either symbolic (parameters that will be set later) or shared (parameters that hold persistent values across function calls) [00:05:04].

**2. Edges:**  
Edges in the graph define the flow of data between nodes. They specify how the output of one operation becomes the input to another, allowing complex expressions to be constructed [00:05:17].

### Symbolic Variables

Symbolic variables are placeholders for inputs in computation graphs. They are defined with a data type and dimensionality, but their specific values are assigned only during the execution phase. This abstraction allows the graph to remain flexible and reusable across different executions and inputs [00:05:09].

## Building a Computation Graph with Tiano

### Steps to Define and Compile a Graph

1. **Define Input Variables:**  
   Begin by defining the symbolic inputs that your graph will use, such as vectors or matrices [00:05:21].

2. **Construct Expressions:**  
   Build the computation graph by linking nodes through operations. Each operation generates intermediate variables, culminating in output nodes that represent the final result of the computation [00:07:03].

3. **Compile Functions:**  
   Once the graph is defined, compile it into a function that can be executed with actual data. This process optimizes the graph and prepares it for efficient runtime execution [00:08:54].

### Automatic Differentiation

Automatic differentiation is a method to compute derivatives of functions represented by computation graphs efficiently. It uses the chain rule to back-propagate gradients through the graph, allowing for gradient-based optimization techniques such as gradient descent [00:09:05].

### Optimizations in Graph Execution

Tiano provides various optimizations during graph compilation, such as eliminating redundant calculations, enhancing numerical stability, and utilizing efficient backend operations like BLAS for linear algebra computations. These optimizations ensure that the execution is as fast and accurate as possible [00:18:48].

### Advanced Techniques: Loops and Scan in Tiano

Tiano supports advanced functionality such as handling loops within computation graphs through constructs like `scan`. This allows for dynamic graph structures and is particularly useful in recurrent neural networks (RNNs), where the number of iterations may not be fixed a priori [00:26:03].

## Applications and Further Reading

Computation graphs are widely used in machine learning frameworks and facilitate a range of applications from simple logistic regression models to complex deep learning architectures. To explore more on building layered architectures or translating models into different frameworks, consider tools like [[principles_of_computation_and_computational_universes]] and resources on [[understanding_complex_mathematical_concepts_through_visualization]].

For further details on using computation graphs in practice, examine implementation examples, such as logistic regression and convolutional networks, to see computation graphs in action [00:32:29]. These examples illustrate detailed steps and considerations involved in deploying models for real-world problems.

The concept of power and its ethical implications has long been a subject of deep examination and debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>. At the heart of understanding power is determining how it is wieldedâ€”whether for self-serving purposes, or for the greater good. This nuanced view considers both the visible and unseen influence of power on societal, organizational, and personal levels.

## Power in Leadership and Business

Jeannie Rometty, the former CEO of IBM, provides a provocative perspective on power in leadership through her career and experiences. Rometty emphasizes the importance of being "essential" to the world, meaning that an organization should serve a vital role in society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:15">[01:01:15]</a>. This notion reflects the ethical obligation of companies to use their power and resources to positively impact the community and environment.

### Vision for Good Power

Rometty's book, "Good Power," explores how leaders can pursue challenging objectives while ensuring the outcomes are beneficial and not detrimental. She articulates that true power is not merely about control or authority but about achieving progress in a way that respects and uplifts others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. Her approach suggests a transition from individual achievements to collective betterment, addressing the ethical complexities of power.

### Decision-Making and Ethical Choices

In her leadership, Rometty confronted the necessity of making decisions that, while unpopular, aligned with long-term ethical standards and strategic goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This highlights the intersection of ethics and leadership, where decisions are evaluated not only on outcomes but also on processes and intentions.

## Ethical Frameworks and Challenges

The transition of power from self-focused to other-focused is instrumental in ethical leadership. This viewpoint aligns with understanding how to manage power ethically, ensuring decisions serve a broader purpose beyond profit and efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### The Role of Ethics in Technology

With the advancement of technology, ethical considerations of power have intensified. As illustrated by innovations such as IBM Watson, technological power must be wielded with a conscious emphasis on ethical implications, such as data privacy, AI ethics, and societal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:50">[01:23:50]</a>.

### Balancing Power and Responsibility

Ethical power involves transparent and responsible decision-making processes where stakeholders' needs and societal impacts are considered. This involves embracing tension and navigating diverse interests to achieve outcomes that benefit the collective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

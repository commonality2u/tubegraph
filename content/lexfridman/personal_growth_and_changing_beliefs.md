## The Role of Philosophy in Challenging Times

Zev posits that philosophy becomes increasingly crucial during difficult periods. He asserts that this traditional sense of deep thinking, which encompasses ideation and technological innovation, can help us reconsider our notions of self and society. Such philosophical engagement is vital in stagnant times when growth is limited and conflict over existing resources is heightened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The Courage in Changing Beliefs

Being open to changing one’s mind is a foundational element of personal growth. Zev candidly expresses his readiness to change his beliefs as part of an ongoing process of self-reflection and scrutiny. This openness to change denotes growth and is a critical aspect of developing a deeper understanding of the world around us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

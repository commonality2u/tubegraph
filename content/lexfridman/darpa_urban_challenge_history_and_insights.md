The DARPA Urban Challenge is a pivotal event in the advancement of autonomous vehicle technology. This challenge was introduced by DARPA (Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency) in 2007 and has played a significant role in shaping the development and public perception of autonomous vehicles.

## Overview

The DARPA Urban Challenge required participants to navigate a 60-mile course, all within an urban environment and under six hours. Vehicles had to be street-legal, equipped with advanced sensors and computers, and capable of handling complex driving situations involving traffic, obstacles, stop signs, and more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36">[24:36]</a>.

## Evolution of The Challenge

The DARPA Urban Challenge followed two previous competitions, known as the DARPA Grand Challenge, which focused on autonomous navigation in off-road environments. The Urban Challenge took this concept further by introducing urban driving elements, including interactions with other vehicles and obeying traffic rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:31">[16:31]</a>.

## The MIT Approach

MIT's entry into the challenge involved a highly sophisticated setup, including a Land Rover LR3 equipped with a plethora of sensors and computational hardware. MIT's approach capitalized on available funding and sponsorships, which allowed for an extensive array of equipment including five cameras, sixteen radars, twelve planar laser scanners, one 3D laser scanner, and a GPS unit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:03">[25:03]</a>. The primary guiding principle was, "if it fits, put it on the vehicle," capitalizing on sensor fusion for comprehensive environmental mapping.

## Key Technologies and Systems

The autonomous systems developed for the challenge incorporated sophisticated motion planning algorithms, including the rapidly-exploring random tree (RRT) algorithm and an optimized version known as RRT* that adapts to both offline and online systems. These algorithms are crucial for navigating complex environments by sampling random points in the state space and connecting feasible paths to avoid obstacles and reach goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05">[09:05]</a>.

MIT's entry utilized a three-tier stack system for navigation: a navigator akin to Google Maps, a motion planner using the RRT algorithms to find paths while avoiding obstacles, and a controller to execute the planned trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00">[30:00]</a>.

## Notable Incidents

A notable incident during the challenge involved a collision between MIT's vehicle and another competitor from Cornell. Both cars were navigating an intersection when the collision occurred due to misinterpretations of sensor data and environmental perception faults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:38">[35:38]</a>. These insights highlighted the complexity and challenges that arise in urban autonomy, such as robust obstacle detection and adaptive control strategies.

## Outcome and Influence

The competition concluded with 89 teams entering and only six finishing. MIT's team finished fourth in the challenge, gaining invaluable experience and influencing future advancements in autonomous vehicle technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:33">[38:33]</a>.

The outcomes of the DARPA Urban Challenge have had lasting impacts on the automotive and robotics industries, notably influencing the early development stages of projects like Google's self-driving car initiative.

## Conclusion

The DARPA Urban Challenge served not only as a competition but also as a catalyst for innovation and research in the field of autonomous vehicles. It provided a dedicated platform for technological experimentation and led to significant breakthroughs that continue to drive the evolution of autonomous driving systems today.

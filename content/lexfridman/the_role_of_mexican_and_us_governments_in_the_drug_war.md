The drug war, primarily between Mexico and the United States, has become an intricate and persistent conflict that reaches deep into the fabric of both nations. This ongoing battle against narcotics involves multiple layers of government participation, international dynamics, and is deeply entangled with the socio-political environment of the regions involved.

## Historical Context and Initiation

The Mexican drug war did not arise overnight. It is rooted in complex historical interactions between the two countries and their respective approaches to drug control and law enforcement. The formal acknowledgment of the drug war can be traced back to 2006 when Mexican President Felipe Calder√≥n launched a major offensive against drug cartels, which involved deploying military forces to combat organized crime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:03">[24:03]</a>. This militarization marked a significant escalation and set a precedent for subsequent government strategies.

## The Influence of Corruption

The war on drugs is profoundly affected by corruption within the ranks of both Mexican and US governments. At multiple administrative levels, corruption has perpetuated the drug trade and undermined efforts to dismantle cartels. In Mexico, it is not uncommon to encounter instances where political candidates are supported by drug cartels, leading to assassinations of rival-supported candidates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:07">[28:07]</a>. Additionally, several state governors have been investigated, are on the run, or are imprisoned due to their cartel affiliations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:23">[28:23]</a>.

Ed Calderon, a security specialist, notes that "anybody can be corrupted" within this environment, pointing to the cultural and systemic nature of corruption in Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03">[01:03]</a>. Such corruption is not only a Mexican issue; the US has faced scrutiny with operations like 'Fast and Furious,' where firearms were allowed to be purchased with the intention of tracking them to cartels, resulting in severe unintended consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>.

## Interactions with the United States

The United States plays a complex role in the drug war, primarily through its demand for narcotics. This demand fuels Mexican cartels and complicates US foreign policy, which oscillates between counter-narcotic operations and concerns over human rights and militarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46">[24:46]</a>.

Moreover, the US government must navigate its legal frameworks when engaging with Mexican officials or actors involved in drug trafficking. The involvement of agencies like the FBI and CIA is crucial for intelligence and operational purposes, though their capacity is often limited by political and public pressures in both nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:02">[29:02]</a>.

## Challenges and Consequences

The drug war also encompasses a broader spectrum of socio-political issues. For instance, immigration and border policy become intertwined as the cartels exploit these routes, not only for drug trafficking but also human trafficking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20">[26:20]</a>. The United States' controversial immigration policies impact the dynamics of drug trafficking, with the porous border serving as a strategic avenue for cartel activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01">[41:01]</a>.

On the Mexican side, the presence of drug cartels significantly affects public trust in government institutions, leading to a perpetuating cycle of violence and corruption. The lack of trust is evident as citizens often resort to cartels for protection and governance instead of the state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:24">[40:24]</a>.

## Future Directions

Analyzing the role of the Mexican and US governments in the drug war requires an acknowledgment of both the internal challenges they face and the external factors at play, such as international supply chains and cross-border collaborations.

In conclusion, the role of governments in the drug war is multifaceted, involving strategic, ethical, and tactical considerations. Understanding this complexity is key to unpacking the pervasive influence of organized crime in both Mexico and the US and in identifying effective strategies for resolution and reform. Both countries face the monumental task of not only curbing the drug trade but also reinstating the rule of law and rebuilding public trust in governmental agencies.

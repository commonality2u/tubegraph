## The Match Setup

The match took place spontaneously after Nakamura went out for dinner with a notable figure from the internet chess club scene. Unbeknownst to Nakamura, this meal would lead to an impromptu invite from Carlsen to engage in an intense series of 40 Blitz games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Nakamura agreed to this offer despite having had a couple of drinks beforehand.

## Insights and Mistakes

Nakamura has often retrospectively labeled the match as a mistake on his part, particularly in terms of competitive trust, as it allowed Carlsen to deeply understand Nakamura’s style of play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The match offered Carlsen a chance to dissect Nakamura's weaknesses, particularly his approach in the opening phase of the game. This revelation eventually led Carlsen to exploit these weaknesses in various subsequent encounters. 

## Exchange of Lessons

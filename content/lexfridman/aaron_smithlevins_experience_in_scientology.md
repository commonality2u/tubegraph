**Aaron Smith-Levin** is a former [[scientologys_belief_system_and_practices | Scientologist]] who was raised in the church and worked for the organization for many years. His journey through and eventually out of Scientology provides an insightful look into both the allure and the complexities of the church's belief system and practices. Today, Aaron educates the public on Scientology through his YouTube channel, "Growing Up in Scientology" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Early Life and Introduction to Scientology

Aaron Smith-Levin was introduced to Scientology at the age of four when his mother joined the organization. By the age of 12, Aaron was removed from school to work full-time for the church. He continued in various capacities, including as a Sea Org member and as someone who trained Scientology auditors, up until he parted ways with the organization at the age of 34 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Scientology's Beliefs and Practices

Scientology, created by L. Ron Hubbard, posits that humans are immortal spiritual beings called thetans trapped in the physical universe. Scientologists believe they can achieve their native, God-like potential through a series of levels known as the Bridge to Total Freedom. Auditing, a type of one-on-one counseling often assisted by an E-meter, is integral to this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Auditing Process

Auditing is designed to clear individuals of negative influences, initially believed to be due to the reactive mind's engrams but later attributed to the presence of body thetans, as learned in higher-level teachings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Aaron described his experience with auditing as something he never enjoyed, perhaps due to his upbringing within the church and discomfort with divulging private information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Departure from Scientology

Aaron's departure from Scientology wasn't by choice; he was effectively forced out because of family connections and his unwillingness to disconnect from family members who had been declared suppressive persons by the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. His wife, too, faced a similarly difficult situation where she refused to disconnect from Aaron, highlighting the harsh policies of disconnection within the church <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:01">[01:43:01]</a>.

## Life After Scientology

Now, Aaron is dedicated to raising awareness about the Church of Scientology. He is the Vice President of "The Aftermath Foundation," an organization that helps people who are escaping from Scientology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. He also discusses Scientology regularly on his YouTube channel, approaching the subject in a manner intentionally designed to resonate with current members by providing what he describes as fair and accurate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

> Aaron's experience underlines the significant impact Scientology can have on personal relationships and family dynamics, often resulting in separation and estrangement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:11">[01:42:11]</a>. This topic is elaborately discussed under [[impact_of_scientology_on_families_and_personal_relationships]].

## Reflections and Current Views

Despite his challenging past, Aaron Smith-Levin does not express hatred towards Scientology or those who remain within it. He believes many members are intelligent individuals operating under a different system of beliefs, suggesting that if they knew what he knows, they might also choose to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:48">[01:45:48]</a>. His focus now is on contributing positively by helping others and discussing the varied experiences individuals have with the church.

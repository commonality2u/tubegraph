The concept of the meaning crisis refers to the widespread decline in the sense of meaning and purpose in people's lives, primarily experienced in modern society. This phenomenon is characterized by an increase in feelings of depression, loneliness, cynicism, and the search for meaning in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Understanding Meaning in Life

John Vervaeke describes "meaning in life" as those factors that make people rate their lives as worthwhile and worthy of the suffering they endure. This involves a sense of connectedness to oneself, others, and to the world, engaging with things that hold value independently of one's egocentric desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Why Is the Meaning Crisis Happening Now?

Vervaeke identifies two primary questions: why is our sense of meaning at risk now, and why is it so crucial for human beings? The search for meaning is deeply tied to connectedness and the need to be part of something larger than oneself. When this connection is lacking, individuals may fall into depression, mental illness, addiction, and self-destructive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## The Role of Modern Society and Historical Influences

There are perennial threats to meaning, such as existential anxiety and a sense of alienation, which have been exacerbated by historical forces that deplete the resources humans have traditionally used to address these challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This depletion is further compounded by the notion that we are in a constant state of mortality, which colors every moment of our existence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## The Influence of Social Changes

The growth of spirituality without religion reflects a shift where individuals seek meaning and connectedness outside traditional religious practices. Many identify as spiritual but not religious, highlighting a search for meaning that isn't mediated by established religious institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Furthermore, the project's promise to transform human nature and create a utopian society, as seen in ideologies like Marxism and the narrative offered by movements like [[impact_of_social_media_and_chaos_in_society]], still influence the political and social landscapes in profound ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:09">[02:45:09]</a>.

## Personal and Collective Solutions

One proposed response to the meaning crisis involves creating ecologies of practices for wisdom cultivation, capable of ameliorating self-deception and enhancing connectedness. This solution involves a collective intelligence approach, possibly requiring a reevaluation of modern social and cultural structures to integrate meaningful change while being vigilant against ideologies that fail to provide genuine transcendence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

The impact of the meaning crisis on society highlights a need for new [[impact_of_technology_on_society]] as a means of addressing existential and spiritual voids, emphasizing the importance of collective endeavors that reintroduce wisdom and meaningful engagement in everyday life.

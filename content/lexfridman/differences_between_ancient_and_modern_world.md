The differences between the ancient and modern worlds are profound, touching on various aspects of human existence such as technology, societal structures, and mindset. Historian Gregory Aldrete delves into these distinctions, highlighting both tangible transformations and consistent threads in human nature.

## Technological Advancements

One of the most apparent differences lies in technology. The advancements from the ancient world to today are staggering, marking significant shifts in how societies operate and interact. In the ancient world, innovations were more gradual and fundamentally different from the rapid advancements and digital transformations characterizing the modern era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Societal Structures

### Mortality Rates

An impactful difference comes from the drastic change in childhood mortality rates. In ancient times, up to 30-40% of children died before reaching puberty, a statistic that deeply affected familial and societal structures and psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Agriculture Dominance

The ancient world was predominantly agrarian with most people engaging in small-scale farming. This contrasts sharply with the modern world, where a minute percentage of the population is employed in agriculture due to technological advancements and industrialization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

### Class Mobility

Class mobility was severely restricted in ancient Rome, tied closely to one's lineage. The concept of a "novus homo," or new man, was a rare designation for individuals who broke into the aristocratic ranks from non-aristocratic backgrounds, highlighting the rigid class structures of the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

## Cultural Legacy and Human Nature

### Influence of Rome

Rome's legacy is pervasive, especially in Western societies. From language, law, cultural ethos, and even holidays, Rome's impact extends deeply into modern times. The legal systems and even linguistic traces of Latin are testament to its long-lasting influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Human Emotions and Behaviors

Despite technological and societal differences, fundamental human emotions—such as fear, greed, love, and hope—remain constant across ages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This constancy provides a basis for connecting with ancient peoples through their writings and artifacts, even as their cultural contexts differ vastly from ours.

## Historical Views and the Past

In ancient Rome, there was a profound obsession with the past, which influenced daily life and decisions—markedly different from the relative disregard or selective engagement with history in contemporary Western societies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

> 
> The Romans revered tradition and held a deep-seated belief in maintaining the ways of their ancestors, often to the point of resisting necessary reforms due to their conservative natures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

The transition from ancient to modern has brought transformative changes in technology, social structures, and the function and emphasis of cultural traditions. However, the enduring aspects of human nature serve as a bridge, connecting us to the past. This connection highlights both what has changed dramatically and what remains powerfully consistent in the human experience.

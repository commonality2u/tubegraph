The neocortex is a pivotal structure within the human brain, integral to our understanding of intelligence. This article explores the role of the neocortex in intelligence and its place within broader theories and studies on human cognition and artificial intelligence.

## Introduction to Neocortex

The neocortex is a distinctive feature of mammalian brains, making up about 70-75% of the human brain's volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. It is involved in higher-order brain functions such as sensory perception, cognition, spatial reasoning, and generation of motor commands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The structure is notably uniform across various regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a> and species, suggesting a common principle underlying its diverse functions.

## Theories and Models

### Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM)

Jeff Hawkins introduced the concept of Hierarchical Temporal Memory (HTM) to emphasize the neocortex's role in processing information over time, forming a memory model of the world, and operating hierarchically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Although HTM has evolved, its foundational principles remain relevant to understanding the neocortex's function.

The Thousand Brains Theory suggests that the brain forms multiple models of any given object or concept, distributed across thousands of cortical columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>. Each cortical column can independently build models and then vote to reach a consensus on perception and cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:55">[00:39:55]</a>.

## Functionality and Spatial Reference

The neocortex not only processes sensory data but assigns it to spatial reference frames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. This ability allows the brain to predict sensory outcomes by knowing the spatial location in a reference frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. This mechanism extends to many cognitive functions, including language, mathematics, and theoretical concepts, all potentially grounded in a spatial frame of reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:20">[00:42:20]</a>.

## Empirical Data and Theoretical Underpinnings

Jeff Hawkins emphasizes the importance of empirical data in forming theories about the neocortex, drawing parallels to historical scientific discoveries where theory often followed extensive data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>. This approach underscores the necessity of assimilating data into a cohesive theoretical model to advance our understanding of intelligence.

## Neocortex and AI

The properties of the neocortex contribute significantly to the field of artificial intelligence, particularly in designing systems that mimic human-like cognitive processes. Unlike current AI that largely relies on statistically driven neural networks, inspirations from the brain's architecture, like sparse distributed representations and continuous learning, are crucial for future advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:14">[01:28:14]</a>.

## Future Implications

Understanding the neocortex holds potential not only for delineating human intelligence but also for creating intelligent machines capable of surpassing human limits in specific tasks. As we bridge gaps between biological and artificial intelligence, the neocortex remains a model of unparalleled complexity and inspiration.

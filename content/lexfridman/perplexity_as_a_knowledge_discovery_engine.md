Perplexity is reimagining the way we search for information on the internet by transforming traditional search engines into what is best described as a "knowledge discovery engine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Unlike a search engine that merely lists links, Perplexity focuses on delivering direct answers backed by citations, facilitating a knowledge exploration journey for the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## The Philosophy Behind Perplexity

> The mission of Perplexity extends beyond mere search functionality; it aims to enhance the knowledge acquisition process, positioning itself as a tool where "knowledge begins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

Perplexity's approach is inspired by the notion that the journey towards understanding does not end with receiving an answer. Instead, it begins with prompting further inquiry and exploration, an idea encapsulated in the phrase, "The Journey Begins after you get an answer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Technological Backbone

### System Architecture

Perplexity operates by marrying search engine capabilities with those of large language models (LLMs). This integration allows the platform to extract relevant data from the web, process it, and then feed it into an LLM, which generates a coherent response complete with citations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This citation-driven approach is critical in reducing [hallucinations in LLMs](https://www.wikiwand.com/en/Hallucination) by ensuring every factual statement is grounded in sourced material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

A key component of Perplexity's success is its use of Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG). This involves:
1. Fetching and processing web documents based on a user query.
2. Generating answers using the processed data.
3. Providing citations for each piece of information presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:08">[01:58:08]</a>.

This structured method ensures that the answers are reliable and can be traced back to their origins, mirroring academic rigor in knowledge referencing.

## User Experience

### Expanding On Curiosity

Perplexity encourages users to delve deeper into topics by providing related questions after delivering an initial answer. This feature is designed to engage users in a continual learning process, fueling curiosity and deeper understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

The search mechanism within Perplexity harnesses the power of human curiosity, guiding users as they traverse, discover, and contextualize knowledge, thereby transforming individual sessions into shared learning experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:17">[02:20:17]</a>.

## The Future of Search

Arvin Sovan, CEO of Perplexity, envisions a future where the internet is not merely a repository of information but a vibrant ecosystem for active engagement and truth-seeking. By framing the search process as an exploratory task rather than a static retrieval action, Perplexity intends to reinvent how users interact with information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Perplexity sets itself apart by not merely searching the web but by facilitating a dynamic process of knowledge discovery. By integrating advanced LLM strategies and ensuring all informational claims are cited, Perplexity stands at the forefront of efforts to redesign how humans interact with the vast expanse of digital information. As it continues to evolve, the engine's ethos revolves around its central mission: to cater to human curiosity and foster an environment where learning never ceases.

## Niels Jorgensen's Experience

### A Day Like No Other

[[september_11_2001_firsthand_experiences_of_a_new_york_firefighter | Niels Jorgensen]], a New York firefighter with over twenty-one years of dedicated service, recounts how September 11th was an overwhelmingly clear and sunny day. The chain of events began with an unremarkable morning until news broke over the radio about a plane striking the World Trade Center. Initially perceived as an accident involving a small aircraft, the day quickly descended into chaos when a second plane crashed into the Twin Towers, confirming the unimaginableâ€”a deliberate attack was unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Rapid Response and a Life-Altering Decision

With typical protocol advising off-duty responders to check in at their respective firehouses, Jorgensen had a crucial decision to make.

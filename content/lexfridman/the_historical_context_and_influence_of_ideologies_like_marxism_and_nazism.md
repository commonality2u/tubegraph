The 20th century witnessed the rise of major ideological forces that dramatically influenced the geopolitical landscape. Among the most significant were [[role_and_impact_of_marxism | Marxism]] and Nazism, both of which had far-reaching consequences on global politics and society. Their influence can be traced back to philosophical traditions and the socio-economic conditions of their time.

## Origins and Philosophical Underpinnings

**Marxism** arose as a critique of capitalism, developed by Karl Marx and Friedrich Engels. It drew heavily on the ideas of Hegel, who Hegel is to Protestantism what Thomas Aquinas was to Catholicism—a philosopher blending religious and philosophical thought. Hegel attempted to create a system that merged the core Mythos of Christianity, applying it philosophically to articulate a narrative of historical progress, where Utopia could be achieved through human participation in divine creation. Marx reinterpreted Hegel's dialectic process, applying it to class struggles and socio-economic realities instead of abstract ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:40:07">[2:40:07]</a>.

**Nazism**, on the other hand, was rooted in reactionary ideologies that twisted and appropriated certain philosophical narratives to serve its agenda. The Weimar Republic, rife with instability and economic troubles, set the stage for Nazi ideologies to exploit the country’s fear and despair for manipulative purposes. Nazism presented a pseudo-religious vision, drawing on Gnostic themes and Mythos to establish a totalitarian state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:48:15">[2:48:15]</a>.

## The Clash of Ideologies

The clash between Marxism and Nazism notably manifested in their direct confrontations during World War II, particularly on the Eastern Front, embodying enhanced ideological warfare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="2:39:23">[2:39:23]</a>. Marxism was seen as a socio-economic movement striving to elevate the working class while promising a future Utopia. Contrarily, Nazism sought to elevate an ethno-national identity through expansionist and racial purity ideologies.

The battle between these ideologies was not just philosophical but also material, resulting in vast human casualties and the entrenchment of these ideas in political systems. The competition and opposition between these ideologies illustrate their role in shaping 20th-century history, underscoring their [[historical_perspectives_on_power_and_ideology | impact on power and ideology]].

## Influence and Modern Implications

Marxism profoundly impacted communist regimes, influencing policies and governance structures across many 20th-century nations. These impacts often resulted in authoritarianism and significant socio-economic changes, as witnessed in the Soviet Union and China. Marking a significant historical shift, these ideologies cultivated societal roles and impacts, often [[comparison_of_political_ideologies_and_their_impact | with a focus on class struggle and economic changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="3:50:16">[3:50:16]</a>.

Similarly, Nazism’s grotesque manifestations were evidenced by aggressive territorial expansions and genocides, marking a catastrophic period in history. The philosophical struggle against Nazism and its [[nazi_science_and_ideology | pseudo-scientific ideologies]] has continued to serve as a warning against totalitarian ideologies.

## Conclusion

The legacies of Marxism and Nazism are complex and multifaceted, reflecting both their roots in intellectual thought and their consequences in practice. The impact these ideologies have had on history continues to inform debates on political ideology, the [[historical_context_and_impact_of_20th_century_economic_and_political_ideas | legitimacy of state power]], and the ongoing search for social justice.

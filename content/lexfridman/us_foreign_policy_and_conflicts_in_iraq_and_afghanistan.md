The conflicts in Iraq and Afghanistan have been central to discussions about [[us_foreign_policy_and_international_relations | US foreign policy]] and the broader implications of military actions in foreign nations. These conflicts have not only been pivotal in shaping modern American military strategies but have also raised significant concerns about the [military-industrial complex](#the-military-industrial-complex), the cost of war, and the philosophies surrounding military intervention.

## The Cost of War

Tulsi Gabbard, a former US Military Lieutenant Colonel, who served in Iraq and Kuwait, discussed the profound lessons learned from her experiences in war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. She highlighted the high human cost on both soldiers and civilians, as well as the financial burden on American taxpayers. Gabbard's firsthand experiences, particularly in a medical unit during the peak of the Iraq War, underscored the substantial casualty toll and the emotional and psychological scars left on soldiers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## The Military-Industrial Complex

A critical element in the discussion of US foreign policy is the role of the [[us_domestic_and_foreign_policy | military-industrial complex]]. Gabbard noted her deployment was an eye-opener to the scale of war profiteering and the deep connections between defense contractors like KBR Haliburton and political figures such as Dick Cheney, which benefited enormously from the war efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The pervasive influence of the military-industrial complex as highlighted by President Eisenhower in his farewell address was emphasized by Gabbard, noting its thriving presence and impact on foreign policy decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:23">[00:15:23]</a>.

## Philosophies on War and Justification

Gabbard, who has been labeled both a war hawk and war dove, has articulated clear conditions under which war might be justified: namely, it must serve national security interests and be a last resort after all diplomatic efforts have been exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>. She critiqued how many military actions have been executed under the guise of the "war on terrorism" without proper justification, citing the invasion of Iraq—a conflict initiated under false pretenses—as a key example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Lessons from Afghanistan

Reflecting on the [[impact_of_foreign_policy_and_war_on_afghanistan | impact of foreign policy and war in Afghanistan]], Gabbard emphasized the shift from targeting Al-Qaeda and Osama Bin Laden to a broader, less focused military engagement that transformed into a regime change operation, straying from its original intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>. This example reflects a recurring theme in foreign policy missteps, where objectives are blurred, and military missions extend beyond their initial scope.

## Ideological and Military Warfare

In addressing terrorism, Gabbard underlined the importance of countering both the military and ideological threats posed by terrorist groups such as Al-Qaeda, ISIS, and Al-Shabab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>. The ideological battle, in her view, involves defeating extremist ideologies with a superior narrative, a front the US had previously stumbled on, especially during the Obama Administration's tenure.

## Navigating the Political Landscape

Gabbard’s own political journey—from being part of the Democratic National Committee to endorsing Bernie Sanders and later becoming an independent—reflects her evolving stance on US foreign policy and military interventions. Her experiences have led her to challenge the establishment’s normative policies and advocate for a more people-centered and realistic approach to international conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.

The discourse on US foreign policy, particularly in Iraq and Afghanistan, remains a tapestry of strategic, economic, and ethical considerations that continue to evoke debate on national and global stages.

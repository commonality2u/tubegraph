Both [[the_role_of_xi_jinping_in_chinas_trade_war_and_international_relations | Xi Jinping]] and Mao Zedong stand as monumental figures in the history of modern China. Despite being separated by decades, they share certain attributes while also differing significantly in others, which speaks volumes about the evolution of China's political landscape.

## Personality Cults

One of the most striking similarities between Xi Jinping and Mao Zedong is the prevalence of personality cults surrounding them. Mao was revered as a revolutionary hero and the center of a massive personality cult from 1949 to 1976, which persisted even among those who suffered under his regime's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Similarly, Xi Jinping has seen a resurgence of this cult-driven reverence. Bookstores in China prominently display his writings and speeches, reminiscent of the Mao era <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Order vs. Chaos

A crucial divergence between the two leaders is their approach to governance. Mao famously embraced chaos and disorder as catalysts for societal change, often emphasizing [[comparison_of_communism_and_capitalism | class struggle]] and reveling in the inversion of traditional structures, inspired by Chinese folklore like the Monkey King <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In stark contrast, Xi emphasizes stability and order, with an apparent preference for predictability over upheaval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Views on Confucianism

Xi Jinping's endorsement of Confucian traditions, which emphasize stable hierarchies, marks a departure from Mao's values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Mao was critical of Confucianism, associating it with feudalism and as an ideal that held China back, whereas Xi sees value in the philosophy's hierarchical and order-promoting aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

## Nationalism and Party Rule

Both leaders share a commitment to Communist Party rule and a vision of China as a significant global force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. They utilize nationalism to legitimize and bolster the government's hold on power. Under Xi, China's nationalism interweaves with economic progression and global engagement, whereas Mao harnessed nationalism to win revolutionary fervor and consolidate power domestically.

## Economic Approaches

Mao and Xi's economic policies also reflect their different eras and approaches. Mao's radical campaigns like the Great Leap Forward aimed at rapid industrialization led to catastrophic famines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:49">[02:45:49]</a>. In contrast, Xi presides over a period of significant economic development and seeks to maintain this growth through international trade relations, despite instances of protectionist policies amid global trade tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>.

## Conclusion

Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping represent different chapters in China's ongoing narrative. They both are emblematic of their respective times, with Mao's era marked by revolutionary ideology and Xi's by a hybrid model of party control paired with economic liberalization and cultural resurgence. While Mao utilized chaos and ideology, Xi opts for a mixture of control, order, and cultural legacy, painting a complex portrait of 21st-century China.

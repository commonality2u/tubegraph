The following article delves into the experiences of [[roger_reaves_and_his_involvement_with_the_medellin_cartel | Roger Reaves]], one of the most infamous drug smugglers in history, particularly focusing on his interactions with Pablo Escobar and the Medellin Cartel. This account draws extensively from a conversation with Reaves, where he provides a first-hand look into his dealings with the cartel.

## Meeting Pablo Escobar and Jorge Ochoa

Roger Reaves worked with the Medellin Cartel, known for its unprecedented control over the global cocaine trade. He was introduced to the cartel through Jorge Ochoa, who was described as the "brains" behind the organization. Reaves recalls his first encounter with Ochoa at a heavily guarded hacienda in Colombia, where he was also introduced to Pablo Escobar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19">[06:19]</a>. Despite their feared reputation, Reaves describes these cartel leaders as gentlemanly and honest within their unconventional moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18">[08:18]</a>.

## Business Operations with the Cartel

Reaves's operations with the cartel were straightforward. He would transport cocaine using his aircraft, charging $5,000 per kilo, which often amounted to millions per trip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29">[07:29]</a>. He recounts that the organization ran almost like a corporation, albeit of illegal activities, with its own insurance system ensuring the safe delivery of drugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22">[10:22]</a>.

## Integrity Amidst Criminality

The astonishing lack of betrayal within the cartel is something Reaves highlights. Despite the high stakes and the immense wealth involved, Reaves witnessed a surprising level of honesty among cartel members, which he attributes to the sheer volume of money in circulation, negating the need for deceit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03">[17:03]</a>.

## Reflections on Pablo Escobar

Reaves offers a complex view of Escobar, acknowledging both his benevolent acts, akin to a Robin Hood figure, and his notorious brutality, particularly in relation to acts of terrorism and violence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09">[11:09]</a>. Reaves respects Escobar for his reliability and integrity in business dealings, albeit acknowledging the violent contradictions of his character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59">[07:59]</a>.

## Risk and Regret

Reaves reflects on his own motivations, admitting that the thrill and financial gain initially drove him, but ultimately concluding that the years lost in prison overshadowed any temporary highs from his operations. He laments the separation from his family and states unequivocally that he would not choose the same path again, despite the adventure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06">[04:06]</a>.

## Conclusion

Roger Reaves's experiences with the Medellin Cartel paint a picture of a paradoxical world where business integrity exists alongside heinous criminal acts.

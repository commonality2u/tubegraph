Affirmative action has been a contentious issue in the context of racial inequality in America, provoking a spectrum of opinions and emotions. This article explores the arguments against affirmative action, particularly from [Glenn Lowry](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Glenn_Loury), a professor of Economics at Brown University, who provides a critical perspective on this form of racial equality effort.

## Critique of Affirmative Action

Lowry expresses a strong dislike for [[critique_of_affirmative_action_and_diversity_programs | affirmative action]], framing it not simply as a disagreement but as a program he despises. He argues that it violates the 14th Amendment, undermining the principles of equal treatment under the law. The main thrust of his argument is that affirmative action functions as a band-aid rather than a genuine solution to deeper societal issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

Lowry argues that affirmative action does not make African Americans smarter, more creative, or more competitive within the actual societal structures and competitions that they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Instead, he suggests it provides a "side door" into systems rather than facilitating equal access through merit-based achievements.

## Historical Context and Racial Identity

The discussion of racial inequality cannot ignore the broader historical context. Lowry reflects on the legacy of [[race_and_affirmative_action_in_education | slavery and racial identity]], drawing on Martin Luther King Jr.'s proclamation of a dream of equality where children would be judged by character rather than skin color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. This dream intersects with affirmative action, which, according to critics like Lowry, deviates from such ideals by focusing on group-based rather than individual-based merit.

## Cultural and Social Dynamics

Lowry believes that [[racism_and_identity_politics | identity politics]] and affirmative action together may obscure the importance of personal responsibility and cultural influences on group achievements. Lowry argues that the emphasis on affirmative action detracts from addressing critical internal differences that may hinder African Americans' success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. He stresses that the success in areas like education is not merely about removing barriers but also about changing cultural attitudes towards learning and discipline.

## Alternatives to Affirmative Action

Lowry alludes to a world where African Americans can thrive autonomously without affirmative action's support. He envisions a society where they are recognized for their merits, similar to the challenges faced by Asian Americans, who may struggle against biases because of their achievements rather than their inherent traits.

## Conclusion

Affirmative action is a topic that garners diverse opinions. Proponents see it as necessary for leveling the playing field, while critics like Glenn Lowry view it as a hindrance to true equality and self-development within racial communities. Lowry's perspective invites a reevaluation of how racial equality can be achieved and sustained by fostering individual competence and minimizing systemic handholding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>.

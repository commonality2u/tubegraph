Libertarianism often revolves around the principle that the highest political value should be liberty. This principle significantly influences libertarian perspectives on both government and war. In a conversation with [[Dave Smith]], a self-identified libertarian and anarcho-capitalist, many libertarian views were discussed, especially concerning the role of government and how it relates to war and peace initiatives.

## The Role of Government

Libertarians broadly argue that the government is fundamentally an instrument of force and tyranny. They believe that as government grows, liberty diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45">[06:45]</a>. A central tenet in libertarian thought is minimizing government intervention to maximize individual freedom. This is consistent with perspectives held by figures like Ron Paul, who has been a major influence in libertarian circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10">[04:10]</a>.

Within the libertarian sphere, there are several schools of thought. Figures such as [[Milton Friedman and Ayn Rands Views on Individual Freedom and Capitalism | Milton Friedman]] and [[Libertarianism and the Libertarian Party | Ayn Rand]] have contributed to mainstream libertarian ideas. However, there is also a more radical branch that Dave Smith aligns with, drawing heavily from Murray Rothbard's anarcho-capitalism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00">[03:00]</a>.

## Perspectives on War

Libertarians typically hold the view that military interventions and wars are largely unjustified. Smith articulates that conflicts are often perpetuated by government actions that respond to violence with more violence, fueling a cycle that escalates hostility rather than resolving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:05">[16:05]</a>. He also emphasizes the libertarian argument for reducing harm to civilians and striving for peaceful resolutions wherever possible. According to Smith, if wars must be fought, the overwhelming onus should be on demonstrating their necessity and minimizing civilian casualties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08">[36:08]</a>.

### Philosophical and Ethical Stances

The discussion extends to the ethical considerations of war. It is argued that libertarians see no moral justification for the killing of innocent people, highlighting the need for exploring all possible non-violent alternatives before resorting to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:31">[34:31]</a>. This stance puts libertarian views in stark contrast with those who justify militaristic approaches based on state interests or broader geopolitical strategies.

**Call to Diplomacy**  
Smith underscores the importance of diplomacy and negotiation, even when dealing with adversarial states, to prevent the onset of war. By reframing opponents as humans rather than monsters, it becomes possible to pursue peaceful discourse and negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:00">[33:00]</a>.

## Libertarian Responses to Current Conflicts

When discussing current events, such as the conflict between Russia and Ukraine, Smith portrays a libertarian perspective that is focused on seeking peace through diplomacy. He criticizes the ongoing military support without a direct plan for peace, arguing that real solutions come from negotiating rather than escalating tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:00">[23:00]</a>.

Further, libertarians are critical of the military-industrial complex and believe in considering whether military intervention genuinely serves the public interest or merely benefits industry players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:42">[20:42]</a>.

## Conclusion

Libertarian views on government and war emphasize maximum individual freedom and minimum government intervention. In terms of conflict, they argue for a focus on diplomacy and peaceful resolutions, critically assessing the motivations and justifications for war. These views continue to influence libertarian discourse as seen through figures like Dave Smith and rooted in the philosophical foundation of individual liberty over state power.

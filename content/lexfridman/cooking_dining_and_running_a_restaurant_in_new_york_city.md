The restaurant quickly garnered attention for its innovative vegan and raw food offerings. The menu at Pure Food and Wine was unique, offering dishes that adhered to a raw food philosophy, where nothing was cooked above roughly 118 degrees Fahrenheit. This culinary discipline was balanced with creative and appealing flavors that brought a fresh perspective to vegan dining in the city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

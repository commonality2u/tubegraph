The intersection of neuroscientific research and technological innovation has led to groundbreaking advancements in the expansion of human senses. This exploration involves enhancing and even creating new sensory experiences, allowing humans to perceive aspects of the world that were previously inaccessible.

## The Concept of Livewired and Sensory Expansion

**David Eagleman**, a prominent neuroscientist, introduces the idea of "livewired" brains in his book *Livewired*. This concept challenges the traditional metaphors of hardware and software, proposing instead that the brain is not static but constantly reconfiguring itself in response to new information and stimuli.

Eagleman suggests that the potential for sensory expansion is immense, with human brains capable of adapting to [new inputs and outputs](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fXb1XhlD86k) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03">[05:03]</a>. By integrating technology with our existing senses, individuals can experience the world in novel ways. This includes the potential to sense infrared or ultraviolet light, phenomena that are typically beyond the reach of human perception.

## Neo Sensory and Practical Applications

Eagleman's startup, Neo Sensory, focuses on non-invasive methods to transfer information to the brain. One such application involves a wristband device with vibratory motors, enabling people who are deaf to "hear" by perceiving sound through their skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05">[05:05]</a>. This approach provides vibrations that correspond to different auditory stimuli, which the brain learns to interpret as auditory perceptions over time.

This development is described as sensory substitution, where input usually processed by one sensory system, like hearing, is conveyed via another, such as touch. This kind of adaptation is a testament to the brain's remarkable plasticity, allowing individuals to develop new qualiaâ€”a term Eagleman uses to describe subjective conscious experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>.

## Potential for Sensory Addition

The future of sensory expansion is promising, extending beyond mere substitution to sensory addition. Neo Sensory experiments with hooking up detectors for infrared and ultraviolet light, enabling new ways for people to experience the world. For example, those wearing the infrared detector could physically feel the presence of infrared radiation around them, effectively broadening their perceptual reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>.

Moreover, perspectives for other kinds of data, such as the magnetic field of the Earth or even abstract data streams like Twitter feeds or stock market fluctuations, could potentially be integrated into human perception through technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06">[05:06]</a>.

## Implications for Human Experience

The implications of expanding human senses are vast, impacting everything from enhancing daily life for individuals with sensory disabilities to potentially augmenting human capabilities in ways that could redefine what it means to be human. This aligns with ongoing discussions about the [[impact_of_technology_on_human_understanding_and_evolution | impact of technology on human understanding and evolution]] and the [[future_technology_and_cybernetic_enhancements | future of technology and cybernetic enhancements]].

As Eagleman continues to explore these frontiers, his work not only advances our scientific understanding but also challenges societal perceptions of [[role_of_technology_in_human_behavior | technology's role in human behavior]], inviting us to reconsider the boundaries of human experience itself.

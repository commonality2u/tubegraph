The **Kardashev Scale** is a method of measuring a civilization's level of technological advancement based on the amount of energy it is able to use. The scale was originally designed by the Russian astrophysicist Nikolai Kardashev in 1964 and it has since been used as a way to speculate on the kinds of powers and technologies of extraterrestrial civilizations we might someday encounter or even become ourselves. 

## Michio Kaku's Perspective

In a conversation with theoretical physicist and futurist [[Michio Kaku]], as transcribed from a podcast, the Kardashev Scale is discussed extensively as a framework for understanding potential [[alien_civilizations_and_cosmology | alien civilizations]]. Kaku elaborates on the different types of civilizations defined by the Kardashev Scale:

1. **Type I Civilization**: This is a planetary civilization that is capable of harnessing all available energy on its home planet. Such a civilization would have complete control over planetary phenomena such as weather and geological events. Kaku draws comparisons to the abilities of science fiction characters like Flash Gordon or Buck Rogers<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>.

2. **Type II Civilization**: This civilization has the capability to harness the energy of an entire star, akin to the feats seen in the fictional universe of Star Trek, where planets have been colonized and energy is drawn from entire star systems<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>.

3. **Type III Civilization**: Progressing further, a Type III civilization would control energy at a galactic scale, comparable to the fictional galactic empires of Star Wars<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>.

4. **Type IV Civilization**: Kaku hypothesizes a fourth type, which would harness energy at the level of the universe itself, potentially using sources like dark energy, which comprises 73% of the universe's energy<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23">[05:23]</a>.

5. **Type V Civilization**: Extending beyond the conventional Kardashev Scale, Kaku suggests the possibility of a civilization that could access energy sources from the [[Intergalactic_travel_and_human_lifespan | multiverse]], such as tapping into the continuum of multiple universes<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33">[06:33]</a>.

## Implications for Humanity

Kaku suggests that our current human civilization is around a Type 0.7 on this scale<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:59">[56:59]</a>, primarily deriving power from "dead plants" like coal and oil, and we may reach Type I status in a hundred years. The evolution of humanity into a Type I civilization involves mastering technologies such as [[Space_travel_and_human_exploration | space travel and human adaptation]], harnessing renewable energy sources, and developing technologies for communication and unification on a planetary scale through the Internet and other systems of global communication<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:02">[57:02]</a>.

Moreover, the discussion of the Kardashev Scale intersects with the search for [[extraterrestrial_life_and_intelligent_civilizations | extraterrestrial life]] and the [[Drake_equation_and_the_search_for_alien_civilizations | search for alien civilizations]], as detecting signals or artifacts from a civilization further along the Kardashev Scale could be a pivotal moment for humanity<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13">[03:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

The conceptual framework of the Kardashev Scale provides a powerful tool for imagining the potential trajectory of human technological evolution as well as the nature of advanced extraterrestrial civilizations. It serves as a guidepost to ponder the future possibilities regarding the evolution and survival of both terrestrial and [[Alien_life_and_civilization | alien life]] in the cosmos.

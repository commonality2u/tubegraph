## Essence of India in Global Interactions

Prime Minister Narendra Modi underscores that his strength in international relations emanates not from his position, but from the backing of 1.4 billion Indians and their rich cultural heritage. The essence of India, with its Vedic traditions and teachings of Swami Vivekananda, accompanies him in every diplomatic engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

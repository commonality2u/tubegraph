Yeonmi Park, a North Korean defector, human rights activist, and author, details her harrowing journey from North Korea to freedom. Her escape is chronicled in part through her 2015 book, _In Order to Live_.

## Early Life in North Korea

Yeonmi Park was born in the northern part of North Korea. Her father was a party member, and her mother was a housewife. Growing up, Park believed she was living in the best country on Earth, a socialist paradise where the rest of the world supposedly worshipped their leader. This environment was heavily influenced by [[north_korean_propaganda_and_control | North Korean propaganda and control]], which painted an idyllic picture of life in North Korea and fostered a deep love and admiration for the country's leadership, free from fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Despite the propaganda, life in North Korea was far from perfect. The country lacked many basic human rights, with no internet, limited electricity, and severe food shortages. The North Korean regime maintained control over the populace by severely restricting access to information and instilling a sense of fear and obedience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

## The Arduous Journey to Freedom

Park's journey to freedom began when she escaped to China at the age of 13. This journey was fraught with danger and uncertainty. One of the most challenging aspects was the constant fear of being captured, which was a daily reality for Park during her time in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

> Park described her time in China as one of paralysis and numbness. Despite being a child, she was forced to confront adult issues such as human trafficking and exploitation. Her survival depended on her ability to remain unseen and unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:06">[00:30:06]</a>.

During this period, Park witnessed and was forced to engage in heartbreaking decisions, like selling her own mother in China as a means of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>. Despite these harrowing experiences, Park remains grateful for the chance to escape, acknowledging that the alternative—staying in North Korea—would have been far worse.

## A Future of Hope

After eventually reaching South Korea, Park was able to continue her education and start a new life. Her story has become a beacon of hope and a call to action for many who seek to understand and combat the [[north_korean_famine_and_starvation | famine]], [[human_rights_violations_in_north_korea | human rights violations]], and the oppressive regime in North Korea.

Yeonmi Park's escape from North Korea offers a powerful narrative of survival against all odds. It underscores the importance of speaking out against oppressive regimes and highlights the resilience of the human spirit amidst unimaginable adversity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>.

Through sharing her experiences, Park continues to advocate for change and brings awareness to the ongoing atrocities faced by the North Korean people. Her journey serves as both a testament to courage and a stark reminder of the work needed to ensure freedom and human rights for all.

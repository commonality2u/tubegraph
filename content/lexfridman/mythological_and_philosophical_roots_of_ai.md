Artificial Intelligence (AI) is often viewed through the lens of modern computer science and mathematics. However, its roots extend far deeper, intertwining with mythological narratives and philosophical ideas from centuries past. Author Pamela McCorduck provides an insightful examination of these connections in her literary works, most notably through her book *Machines Who Think*, published in 1979, which explores the historical and philosophical significance of AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## The Mythological Origin

The journey of AI is often traced back to an ancient human aspiration to create beings like the gods, as succinctly summarized by a quote from McCorduck's work: "Artificial intelligence began with the ancient wish to forge the gods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This notion of creating life mirrors stories and myths that have pervaded human culture for centuries, such as Homer's robots in the *Iliad* and the figures of legend like The Golem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Hellenic and Hebraic Views

Pamela McCorduck distinguishes between two approaches to artificial creation within myth: the Hellenic and the Hebraic points of view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>:

- **Hellenic View:** Robots and creations are seen positively, as helpers or servants of gods, aiding in various mythological narratives.
- **Hebraic View:** Rooted in the religious commandment against creating graven images, this view perceives the act of human imitation in creation as blasphemous.

## Philosophical Foundations

The philosophical underpinnings of AI are seamlessly interwoven with its mythological background. According to McCorduck, the conception of AI was not driven solely by the scientific domain but also by stories and legends. This intersection is apparent as far back as the Dartmouth Conference in 1956, where foundational ideas were proposed by pioneers like Marvin Minsky, John McCarthy, Allen Newell, and Herbert Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

### Intelligence Beyond the Human Mind

One compelling philosophical impetus for creating AI, per the transcript, is the quest to understand intelligence beyond the confines of the human mind. AI pioneers were captivated by the idea of simulating human cognition outside the human brain, a notion explored extensively by cognitive psychologists Newell and Simon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Historical Literature and AI

McCorduck identifies that literature has long harbored themes of artificial creation, from Frankenstein to the automatons of ancient myths. This literary tradition informs present understanding and societal interaction with AI, emphasizing both its potential and the ethical considerations of its development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>.

## Ethical and Philosophical Implications

The philosophical exploration of AI also involves its ethical implications, such as the concept of the "male gaze" in film criticism. This term is used to describe how AI could alter existing power dynamics, drawing parallels to how women have historically been objectified within media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:31">[00:52:31]</a>.

> [!info] Reflection and Summation
> McCorduck’s examination of AI encompasses its mythological beginnings and its aspirations for intelligence resembling humans. Her work prompts consideration of AI not merely as a technological feat but as a continuation of ancient human storytelling, urging society to tackle both its philosophical foundations and ethical ramifications in the course of its evolution.

Overall, Pamela McCorduck’s perspectives underscore that AI is as much a product of our cultural and philosophical heritage as it is of scientific innovation. As evidenced by McCorduck's dialogues and reflections on early AI and its pioneering figures, the development of AI entwines deeply with our enduring mythological and philosophical narratives.

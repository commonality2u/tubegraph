Natural Language Processing (NLP) lies at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence (AI), and linguistics, with its primary goal to enable computers to process, and in some form "understand," natural language to execute tasks useful for humans, such as [[natural_language_understanding_and_computational_knowledge | question answering]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. However, the aspiration for computers to fully understand and represent language meaning remains elusive, as true language understanding correlates with AI completenessâ€”a concept where comprehending linguistic inputs involves understanding all aspects of visual and cognitive inputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## NLP Complexity and Levels

Natural language is inherently complex, involving multiple levels of understanding from phonemic breakdown and morphological analysis to syntactic and semantic interpretation. Deep learning has notably enhanced capabilities in speech recognition, syntax, and semantics by simplifying traditional NLP models that required morphological or syntactic analyses, thus enabling direct handling of semantically meaningful tasks without extensive linguistic resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Challenges and Ambiguities

One of the challenges in NLP is handling the ambiguity inherent in natural language. For instance, a simple sentence like "I made her duck" can possess multiple meanings depending on the context, showcasing the necessity for situational awareness for adequate semantic parsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### Applications

NLP applications range broadly from simple tasks like spell-checking to complex systems like machine translation and question answering. More advanced applications like [[applications_of_deep_learning_in_nlp | spoken dialogue systems]] and [[advancements_in_natural_language_processing_in_alexa | automated email replies]] demonstrate significant complexity and are subjects of ongoing research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Representations and Deep Learning in NLP

Deep learning reshaped NLP by utilizing word vectors along with recurrent neural networks, skipping detailed grammatical analyses and directly addressing meaningful tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. The introduction of word vectors, such as Word2Vec and GloVe, revolutionized text representation through distributional semantics, representing words in vector spaces based on their context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

### Recurrent Neural Networks

Recurrent Neural Networks (RNNs) are pivotal in sequence tasks, with models like Gated Recurrent Units (GRUs) providing advanced memory retention capabilities over standard RNNs. These models allow language models to capture context across sequences by maintaining relevant word and phrase relationships over extended text spans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.

## Advances and Future Directions

The evolution of deep learning in NLP leads to the potential creation of systems capable of question answering across any domain using architectures like Dynamic Memory Networks (DMNs). These systems propose a generalized approach where other NLP tasks can be abstracted into question-answering formats, leveraging question relevance through episodic memory modules and attention mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>.

The landscape of NLP continues to expand with ongoing breakthroughs in deep learning techniques, aiming for models that account for knowledge base integration and advancements in handling low-resource languages or domains without significant data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

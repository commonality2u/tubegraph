Moral evolution is a fascinating subject that spans centuries and civilizations, undergoing significant transformations that reflect the shifting sands of human thought and culture. One pertinent aspect of this evolution is the role of religion and its influence on societal values and moral codes.

## The Evolution of Moral Values

Moral values have undergone significant change across the centuries, often moving towards less racist and less sexist attitudes. The progression of moral values is evident when comparing the moral compass of people today with that of the 17th, 18th, or even the 19th centuries. In the 21st century, despite variations among individuals, there is a general consensus towards more liberal and humanitarian attitudes compared to previous generations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:00">[40:00]</a>.

Moral evolution seems to follow a progressive pattern, albeit not in the value judgment sense, but in a transitive sense. Each moral progression builds on the preceding steps, generally moving society towards what might be considered a more decent and humane set of values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:00">[44:00]</a>.

## The Influence of Religion on Morality

Religion has historically played a significant role in shaping moral values. However, as societies evolve, they often move beyond the morals dictated by ancient religious texts, which may not align with contemporary ethical views. For instance, the morals depicted in the Old Testament reflect Bronze Age values that are largely considered outdated by today's standards. Concepts like human sacrifice and revengeful justice no longer resonate with modern sensibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:00">[41:00]</a>.

### Do We Need Religion for Morality?

The argument that human beings need religion to be moral is challenged by the observation that moral values often change independently of religious influence. As Richard Dawkins suggests, humans don't need religion to be moral; instead, society's moral fabric can evolve and improve over time through reason and scientific understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:00">[39:00]</a>. In this view, truth and reason—considered not just from scientific methods but through sensory observation—offer a framework for moral progression that is consistent with evolving societal norms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00">[27:00]</a>.

## Societal Dynamics and Religious Belief

Questions often arise about whether society is fundamentally tied to religion for its moral and functional structure. While some individuals continue to hold religious beliefs, the argument for societal dependency on religion is not universally persuasive. Societies can function effectively without adopting specific religious ideologies, as witnessed by the fact that many individuals live morally upright lives without subscribing to religious beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00">[28:00]</a>.

Moreover, the idea that religion can serve as a unifying figurehead in society is critiqued for being somewhat patronizing. The notion that while educated individuals may relinquish religion, "the plebs need it" is seen as a flawed perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:00">[28:00]</a>.

## Spirituality Without Superstition

Spirituality and a sense of wonder at the universe can coexist with a scientific view of the world without resorting to supernatural explanations. While there is much in the universe that remains a mystery, invoking supernatural causes is viewed as an intellectual resignation. Instead, embracing humility and a commitment to scientific inquiry is championed as a more productive approach to understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:00">[30:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Moral evolution demonstrates that human values are not static but progressively molding, often independent of religious frameworks. While religion has historically influenced morality, contemporary society shows that ethical standards can continue to develop through reason and evidence-based understanding. As society continues to transition through epochs, the ongoing evolution of morality will likely reflect an increasingly nuanced and sophisticated comprehension of ethical conduct.

Leadership in large organizations, such as [[leadership_and_teamwork_in_engineering_projects | IBM]], involves navigating complex challenges that stem from the sheer scale of the organization and the pervasive impact of its operations on society. Ginni Rometty, the former chairman, president, and CEO of IBM, provides a detailed look into the nature of leadership in such environments through her experiences.

## The Challenges of Large-Scale Leadership

Leading a company with a vast number of employees and an enduring legacy involves making difficult decisions that may not always be popular. As Rometty notes, "Anytime you have to run a company that endures a century and has to endure another century, you will do unpopular things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The key challenge is transitioning the organization, knowing what to change and what should endure, while modernizing its operations to keep pace with the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Embracing Essential Values

At the core of IBM's strategy was the commitment to be "essential" to the world's infrastructure, ensuring they remain critical and indispensable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This commitment involves performing mission-critical work that underpins systems like banking and railroads, emphasizing reliability, security, and operational excellence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Managing Bureaucracy and Promoting Speed

Large organizations often suffer from extensive bureaucracy, which can slow down decision-making processes and stifle innovation. Rometty highlights the importance of reducing layers of management to speed up decision-making and empower employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Furthermore, instilling principles like agile methodologies across the workforce is crucial in adapting to fast-paced external trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## The Critical Role of Leadership

Leaders in large organizations must often take control and make tough, strategic decisions, especially in times of crisis. "It is of course, yes," Rometty affirms when asked if leaders must be autocratic at times to steer the organization in the right direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Leadership is not a popularity contest, and making sacrifices for long-term gains is sometimes necessary.

## Building Trust and Fostering Innovation

Fostering a culture of trust and innovation is paramount. This involves encouraging a willingness to learn and adaptability in the face of change. Rometty's hiring philosophy evolved from seeking experts to prioritizing those who are curious and willing to learn, as they are more likely to embrace change and drive the company forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Navigating Power Dynamics

In her book "Good Power," Rometty explores the notion of using power positively, asserting that it involves bridging divides, respecting others, and focusing on progress rather than perfection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>. This approach aligns with contemporary discussions on the [[impact_of_leadership_and_power_in_conflicts]] and the [[the_importance_of_diversity_and_inclusion_in_corporate_leadership | importance of diversity]] in leadership roles.

## Conclusion

Leadership and decision-making in large organizations are complex and require balancing short-term needs with long-term goals, all while fostering a culture of innovation and resilience. Rometty's experiences underline the importance of leadership that is adaptable, values-driven, and centered on the fundamental goal of being essential to society.

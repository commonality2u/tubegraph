Magnus Carlsen, the world-renowned chess grandmaster, often shares insights into his daily routines and personal philosophies that contribute significantly to his success on and off the chessboard. Below is a comprehensive overview of the habits and beliefs that shape Carlsen's life.  

## Daily Routines

### A Typical Day of a Chess Match
On a typical day of a chess match, especially when games are scheduled for the afternoon, Magnus is known to wake up around 11 a.m. 

> "I'll probably wake up, uh, pretty late at about 11... I'll get back, I'll have a big lunch like usually like a big omelet with a bunch of salad and stuff" [01:21:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:44]</a>).

Magnus enjoys taking a walk and often listens to podcasts, allowing him to focus and clear his mind before engaging in a game.

### Routine at Tournaments
During chess tournaments, Carlsen places high importance on maintaining a good routine and feeling well physically and mentally. He doesn't like having too many distractions around him and prefers a small, close-knit support team.

> "The things that make me the happiest at tournaments is just having a good routine and, uh, feeling well" [01:21:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>).

Magnus usually prefers to play his games first, winning them cleanly if possible, to enjoy his time thereafter. 

### Practice and Training
While Carlsen leads a relaxed approach to daily practice, he consumes chess content naturally. Interestingly, he avoids a highly structured training regimen, instead opting for reading chess books akin to casual reading, drawing inspiration from various historical games.

> "I've never been that guy at all. Like, I could never force myself to just sit down and work" [01:37:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>).

This leisurely consumption of chess knowledge fills his day without feeling burdensome or tedious.

### Diet and Exercise
Magnus Carlsen approaches his diet strategically around his games and practices. His philosophy is to eat twice a day and avoid heavy meals or sugary foods before matches to maintain consistent energy levels.

> "I try not to eat too heavy before the game or in general to avoid sugary stuff" [01:26:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:14">[01:26:14]</a>).

Carlsen's exercise habits are equally as dynamic. He enjoys engaging in sports like football and tennis more than traditional workout routines.

> "I've always kind of done it more for fun than like for a concrete benefit" [01:34:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:52">[01:34:52]</a>).

## Personal Philosophies

### Love for the Game
Magnus Carlsen's philosophy in life and chess is rooted deeply in a genuine love for the game. His engagement with chess is not merely a pursuit of victory but a passion that drives him every day.

> "And I just spend all of that time on my own without thinking that it's work or without thought that I'm doing this to improve my chess." [02:04:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:41">[02:04:41]</a>).

### Winning vs. Losing
Carlsen expresses a healthy relationship between his love for winning and understanding of loss. He differentiates between the joy of winning tournaments and the anxiety of defending a title.

> "Other tournaments, love of winning is a great, great factor" [00:44:31](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>).

### Finding Meaning and Fun
In reflecting on life, Carlsen surprisingly views life as "meaningless" in a positive, existential way, emphasizing the importance of pursuing what brings joy.

> "It's still a great thing... Just to make not necessarily the most of it but the things that make you happy." [02:30:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:42">[02:30:42]</a>).

This article summarizes Bryan Kaplan's perspectives on feminism and gender equality, as discussed in an interview with Dwarkesh Patel, primarily drawing from Kaplan's book "Don't Be a Feminist."

## Defining Feminism

Bryan Kaplan begins by challenging common dictionary definitions of feminism, such as "the theory that women should be the political, social, economic, cultural equals of men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He argues this definition is flawed because public opinion data shows an overwhelming majority of people who identify as *non-feminists* still agree with the equality of women across these dimensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

Instead, Kaplan proposes that the distinguishing view of feminism is the belief that "society treats women less fairly than men" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He contends this definition better aligns with actual usage, as it would be strange for a self-proclaimed feminist to believe men get terrible treatment and women are treated like goddesses, or for a non-feminist to believe women are treated terribly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. He dismisses the idea that feminism could simply mean wanting to "raise the status of women" irrespective of current fairness levels, arguing this is not how the term is commonly understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Meritocracy and Representation

Kaplan states his belief in meritocracy as a good and intuitively appealing system that works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He argues against trying to achieve demographic representation (e.g., "get more members of group X") and instead advocates focusing on finding the best way to get top-quality people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

While acknowledging that an "astounding ratio of men" in certain positions *could* hypothetically impact a company's business, he believes that in current culture, the pressure is more likely to "get rid of men despite the fact that the men are delivering value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He makes an exception for "ladies' night" in a bar as good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, but for tasks requiring correct answers, effective operation, or learning, the focus should be on what leads to knowledge, not demographic targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. He also warns of a "slippery slope" once exceptions to meritocracy are made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Shifting Landscape of Fairness

### Does Feminism Become More True Over Time?
Dwarkesh Patel questions if societal and technological trends (e.g., safer jobs, automation of dangerous work, increasing rewards for peak performers who may be disproportionately male) make feminism, by Kaplan's definition, more true over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Kaplan argues that several factors make feminism *less* true over time:
1.  **Hyper-concern:** Society has become very hyper-concerned with the mistreatment of women, making actual unfairness less likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
2.  **False Accusations:** He believes the climate of "false feminist accusations about unfairness" and "grossly exaggerated hyperbolic accusations" primarily endured by men, tips the scales, making society less fair to men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

However, he also acknowledges areas where women's situations may have worsened, notably a decline in "paternal support for children." He estimates the likelihood of a biological father helping raise children dropped from around 90% in 1940 to perhaps 60-70% currently, a way women are treated less fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

### Women's Happiness
Referencing Stevenson and Wolfers research, Kaplan notes that women's self-reported happiness has declined slightly relative to men's since the 1960s (e.g., from a 2 percentage point advantage to a 2 percentage point deficit in saying they are "very happy") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:47">[00:27:47]</a>. He emphasizes the small magnitude of this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>.
Potential (though not confirmed) explanations he would explore include:
1.  The rise of single motherhood, whose lives are hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.
2.  Feminism itself telling women they *should* be unhappy due to societal unfairness, which might particularly affect feminist elites who internalize these ideas deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.

Dwarkesh suggests a theory that feminism itself might make feminism "more true" by causing negative outcomes for women (e.g., elite women's unhappiness, more single mothers, less mentorship for women due to #MeToo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. Kaplan reframes this: if men change their behavior due to false accusations, it's society treating men unfairly, which then has negative side effects for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. He uses the analogy of foot-binding in China, reportedly driven by women, as a complex case of intra-female abuse that still resulted in women being treated less fairly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>.

## Global Feminism and US Influence

Dwarkesh asks if US feminism, even if "overcorrected" domestically, might still be a net positive globally where women face more severe unfairness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Kaplan acknowledges significantly worse treatment of women in places like Saudi Arabia, and concerning issues like female infanticide in India and China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

However, he is skeptical of US feminism's positive global impact:
*   **Misplaced Focus:** American feminists spend very little rhetorical energy (perhaps less than 1%) on severe issues like female infanticide in China and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Distraction:** The emphasis on "small or exaggerated or just reverse problems" in the first world distracts from and indirectly causes neglect of serious problems elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   **Discrediting Effect:** He argues that "crazy arguments" and "unfriendliness" from the feminist movement can discredit the cause rather than positively shifting the Overton window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   **Cultural Separation:** There's too much cultural separation for angry rhetoric about exaggerated US issues to effectively address problems like infanticide in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. He uses Alex Tabarrok's "paper straws" analogy: focusing on trivial Western concerns (like paper straws or more female CEOs) in developing countries can blind people to far more severe local problems (like trash-covered streets or female infanticide) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:56">[00:19:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.

## Perceptions, Preferences, and Workplace Dynamics

### Cosmic Unfairness vs. Unfortunate Circumstances
When asked about "unfairness" towards women not caused by societal mistreatment but by other factors (e.g., "cosmos"), Kaplan prefers the term "unfortunate" rather than "unfair" if no human agent is involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>.
He discusses biological endowments:
*   Most people prefer to remain their birth gender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:43]</a>.
*   Women tend to have higher neuroticism but also higher agreeableness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. Kaplan personally notes he'd value being a woman for the ability to have more children, which he believes is easier for women to achieve due to stronger preferences influencing family size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.
*   The "Women and Children First" ethos means society cares about female suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   On the idea that society sympathizes more with men's success but cares more for women's suffering, Kaplan argues suffering is universal, while notable success is rare, making sympathy for suffering more broadly applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.

### Workplace Issues
*   **Personality Defects:** Dwarkesh mentions Tyler Cowen's research suggesting employers hold personality "defects" (e.g., being too agreeable or aggressive) more against women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Kaplan counters that employers are often more willing to fire men (e.g., for insubordination) and men are more likely to be penalized for dress code violations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   **Mentorship:** Kaplan argues feminism has "visibly messed up" mentoring, with male managers reluctant to mentor female employees due to fear of accusations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>. He criticizes the feminist reaction which often blames these men rather than offering reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of recognizing misunderstandings in conflicts, rather than assuming malice or hypersensitivity being correct, for maintaining relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:50">[00:40:50]</a>.
*   **Endogenous Sexism:** Kaplan explains his essay on "endogenous sexism," where the tendency to have more same-gender close friends (who are hand-picked and thus viewed favorably) can lead to an illusion of one's own gender being superior, as one often interacts with the less-impressive partners of these friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:37">[00:36:37]</a>.

### Rhetorical Dynamics
Kaplan finds Richard Hanania's argument that "women's tears win" in the marketplace of ideas plausible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. He observes that conversations about feminism are often one-sided, with women voicing complaints and men mostly listening silently, partly out of fear or discomfort in arguing with angry or sad women, and partly due to the "women and children first" ethos suggesting one shouldn't dispute women's complaints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:36">[00:34:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>.

### Gendered Appeal of Professions
Dwarkesh raises the point that male-dominated professions (like computer science or economics) might not be intrinsically more appealing to men but are taught or advertised in ways that cater to male thinking [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:40">[00:42:40]</a>. Kaplan responds that it's unreasonable to demand entire disciplines change to suit newcomers; rather, those wishing to enter should adapt to the existing culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. He notes that female-dominated fields (e.g., flower arranging, cooking) don't face similar pressures to change for men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:32">[00:44:32]</a>. He also argues that traits like "acting like there's an objectively correct answer" shouldn't be dismissed as "male traits" but are vital virtues for many fields, enjoyable by all humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.

## Kaplan's Approach
Kaplan describes his books, including "Don't Be a Feminist," as attempts to calmly go through issues on their merits, acknowledging weaknesses in his own arguments, rather than adopting a "lawyerly" style of defending a thesis at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:17">[02:03:17]</a>. The lead essay in "Don't Be a Feminist" is framed as a letter to his daughter, aiming to help her and others navigate these issues without anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. His stated dream is for everyone to read his work and feel happy and grateful, aiming to "turn every enemy into a friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:36">[02:03:36]</a>.

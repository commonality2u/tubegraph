## Portrayal of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the Atomic Bomb Program in Media

The depiction of J. Robert Oppenheimer and the atomic bomb program in various media has been a subject of discussion, with particular attention given to historical accuracy and narrative choices. Richard Rhodes, Pulitzer Prize-winning author of *The Making of the Atomic Bomb* [[the_making_and_impact_of_the_atomic_bomb | The Making and Impact of the Atomic Bomb]], has commented on these portrayals, including an upcoming film for which he was consulted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Upcoming "Oppenheimer" Film

#### Initial Impressions and Consultation
Richard Rhodes shared his early impressions of a new film about Oppenheimer, noting that he had been consulted on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Based on the trailer, he commented positively on the visual accuracy, stating, "They've really done a good job of things like the Trinity test device, which was the sphere covered with cables of various kinds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

#### Casting and Physical Resemblance
Rhodes observed that the actor portraying Oppenheimer, whom he recognized from the series *Peaky Blinders*, bore a significant physical resemblance to the historical figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He described Oppenheimer as being about six feet tall and "rail thin," noting that Oppenheimer "never weighed more than about 140 pounds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Rhodes felt this "quality is there in the actor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The interviewer also noted the positive impact of actors resembling their roles, citing Bryan Cranston's portrayal of LBJ as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

#### Narrative Challenges and Expectations
The ultimate success of the film, according to Rhodes, "all depends on how the director decided to tell the story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He highlighted the inherent challenge of condensing the vast and complex story of Oppenheimer and the bomb program into a standard-length movie, stating, "There are so many aspects of the story that you could never possibly squeeze them into one 2-hour movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. He suggested that a "multi-part series" would be more appropriate to "tell a lot more of the story, if not the whole story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Despite this, he found the film project "exciting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Rhodes expressed a particular hope that a scene from Oppenheimer's security clearance hearing would be included. In this scene, when asked if he would have used a hydrogen bomb on Hiroshima, Oppenheimer replies "No," because "the target was too small" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a> - <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:04">[00:39:04]</a>.

### Past Depictions
Rhodes acknowledged a history of unsatisfactory portrayals, mentioning that "There have been some terrible depictions of Oppenheimer, there've been some terrible depictions of the bomb program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He expressed hope that the new film would "get this one right" [[j_robert_oppenheimer_and_his_role_in_the_atomic_bomb_development | J.

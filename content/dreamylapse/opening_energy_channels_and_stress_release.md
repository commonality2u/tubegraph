## Getting Started

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with a straight back and feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Repeat this breathing process several times until a feeling of relaxation and centeredness is achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Energy and Chakra Visualization

### Initial Energy Flow

Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, which then fills you with positive energy and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Feel this energy flowing throughout your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell, akin to a [[full_body_energy_cleanse | full body energy cleanse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, symbolizing your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Stress Release

As you continue deep breathing, visualize any negative thoughts or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release any stress, tension, or anxiety, and observe your body and mind becoming lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Focusing on the Sacral Chakra

Subsequently, bring your attention to your sacral chakra, situated just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is linked with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light radiating from this area, spreading outwards and filling you with confidence and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Affirmations

While focusing on the sacral chakra, repeat the following affirmations to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

> I am confident and masculine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

> I am worthy of love and affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Allow these affirmations to deeply resonate, feeling their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

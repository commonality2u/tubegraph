The video features an extended musical composition designed for sleep or relaxation purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The audio primarily consists of continuous musical pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. Throughout the duration, occasional vocalizations such as "hmm" and "ah" are interspersed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, along with applause sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:32">[00:34:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:42">[00:35:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:16">[00:38:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:30">[00:49:30]</a>. The composition is consistent with what would be used as [[music_for_relaxation | music for relaxation]] or to aid in [[impact_of_music_on_sleep | sleep]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

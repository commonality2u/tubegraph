It incorporates visualizations and specific [[affirmations_for_selfacceptance_and_confidence | affirmations]] to cultivate a stronger sense of self and promote overall well-being.

## Meditation Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with a straight back and feet firmly on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes and take several deep breaths, inhaling through the nose, holding briefly, and exhaling through the mouth until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Energy Flow and Visualization

Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, filling you with positive energy and vitality, and flowing through your entire body to revitalize and nourish every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Chakra Focus

*   **Root Chakra**: Focus on your root chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, symbolizing your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   **Releasing Negativity**: As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any negative thoughts or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release stress, tension, or anxiety, feeling your body and mind become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Sacral Chakra and Affirmations for Confidence

Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Visualize a vibrant orange light radiating outwards from this area, filling you with confidence and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. As you focus on this chakra, repeat the following [[affirmations_for_selfacceptance_and_confidence | affirmations]] to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

*   "I am confident and masculine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   "My Sexual Energy is powerful and balanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   "I am worthy of love and affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Allow these [[affirmations_for_selfacceptance_and_confidence | affirmations]] to sink in, feeling their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Visualize a beam of white light shining down from above, enveloping you in its healing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Focusing on the Root Chakra

*   **Visualization**: Envision a bright red ball of light at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. See this chakra spinning and glowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Affirmation**: Repeat to yourself, "I am grounded and secure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

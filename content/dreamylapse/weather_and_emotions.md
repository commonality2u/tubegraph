The narrative often intertwines atmospheric conditions, particularly rain and night, with the internal emotional state of the speaker.

## The Persistent Rain and Inner Turmoil
A continuous downpour is frequently mentioned, mirroring an unsettled mind. The rain hadn't stopped all night, just as the questions in the narrator's head hadn't ceased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This persistent rain recurs, emphasizing its long-lasting presence and correlating with unresolved thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:28">[00:50:28]</a>.

## The Oppressive Night and Emotional Weight
The night is consistently depicted as thick and heavy, often compared to molasses and [[releasing negative thoughts | bad memories]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This imagery suggests a pervasive, suffocating atmosphere that weighs on the mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:41">[00:50:41]</a>.

As the journey progresses, the night is described as wrapping itself around the narrator "like a velvet noose," intensifying feelings of entrapment or impending doom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:25">[00:57:25]</a>.

## Rain's Attempt to Cleanse Guilt
The rain is personified as if trying to wash away "the guilt off the sidewalks," but ultimately failing in its task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. This highlights the enduring nature of guilt, unaffected by external attempts at cleansing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

## Hope and Regret in a Dark City
In a city described as "built on regrets," [[Trust and deception | hope]] is considered a dangerous thing to carry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. This emotional caution aligns with the bleak, unchanging nature of the city, which is perceived as "always rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:26">[00:42:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:50">[00:58:50]</a>.

The lengthening shadows cast by streetlights suggest a diminishing sense of self or increasing insignificance, where even the man walking beneath them is overshadowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>.

This meditation practice is designed to increase libido, promote positive masculinity, boost self-esteem, and facilitate the opening of energy channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Beginning the Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds before exhaling through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Repeat this breathing process until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Energy Visualization

Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, filling you with positive energy and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Feel this energy flow throughout your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Chakra Focus

### Root Chakra

Focus next on your Root Chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, which represents your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Releasing Negativity

As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any [[releasing_negative_thoughts_and_selfdoubt|negative thoughts and self-doubt]] or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release any stress, tension, or anxiety, feeling your body and mind become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Sacral Chakra

Bring your attention to your Sacral Chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and [[building_a_positive_self_image|positive masculinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area, radiating outwards and filling you with confidence and [[building_a_positive_self_image|self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Affirmations for Confidence

As you focus on the Sacral Chakra, repeat the following [[affirmations_to_build_selfesteem_and_confidence|affirmations to build self-esteem and confidence]] to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

- "I am confident and masculine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
- "My Sexual Energy is powerful and balanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
- "I am worthy of love and affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Allow these [[power_of_positive_affirmations|positive affirmations]] to sink in and feel their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Achieving Balance and Harmony

Finally, take a few deep breaths and visualize the energy channels in your body opening up and flowing freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Feel a sense of [[benefits_of_balancing_energy_centers|balance and harmony]] as your mind and body are brought into alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

When you are ready, take a final deep breath and slowly open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to appreciate the renewed sense of energy and vitality you feel, and carry this positive energy with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

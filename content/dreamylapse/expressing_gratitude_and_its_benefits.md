Embrace this feeling of gratitude, letting it fill your entire being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Continue to breathe and think of more things for which you are grateful, allowing yourself to feel the warmth and joy that comes with each expression of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

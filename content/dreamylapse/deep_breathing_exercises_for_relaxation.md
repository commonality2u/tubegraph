## Preparing for the Exercise

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Closing your eyes can help in focusing your attention inward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Deep Breathing Technique

The core [[breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | deep breathing]] method involves:

*   **Hold**: Hold your breath for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **Exhale**: Release the breath slowly through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

Repeat this sequence multiple times until you feel your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

### Heart Center Visualization
Bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Visualize a warm, loving light radiating from your heart and spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Conversely, as you exhale, release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Affirmations

With an exhale, release them, visualizing them dissipating like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

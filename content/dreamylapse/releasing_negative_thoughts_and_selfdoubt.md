This practice guides you through a meditation designed to release negative thoughts and self-doubt, while cultivating self-love and confidence.

## Setting the Foundation
Begin by finding a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, then releasing it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Repeat this process until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Next, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Releasing Negativity
As you exhale, consciously release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding on to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Affirmations for Self-Worth
Repeat the following [[affirmations_to_build_selfesteem_and_confidence | affirmations]] to yourself silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

*   "I love and accept myself exactly as I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   "I am deserving of love and respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   "I am confident and capable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   "I trust myself and my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

As you repeat these [[power_of_positive_affirmations | affirmations]], visualize them becoming a part of your being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Dissipating Self-Doubt
Next, focus on any negative thoughts or self-doubt that may be holding you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Acknowledge them, and then release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. See them dissipating like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This [[letting_go_of_thoughts_like_waves | visualization technique]] helps in letting go.

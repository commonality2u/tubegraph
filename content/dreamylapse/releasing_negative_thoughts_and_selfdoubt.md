Releasing negative thoughts and self-doubt is a core practice for cultivating [[building_selfesteem_and_selfacceptance | self-esteem]] and [[achieving_inner_peace_and_happiness | inner peace]]. This process often involves a combination of relaxation techniques, visualization, and positive affirmations.

## Initial Relaxation and Centering

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds before releasing it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Repeat this breathing exercise until your mind and body start to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Next, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. As you exhale, consciously release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Affirmations for Releasing Negativity

As part of the practice, repeat [[affirmations_for_self_esteem_and_confidence | affirmations]] to yourself silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These [[how_affirmations_can_shift_mindset_and_beliefs | affirmations]] help to counteract negative thought patterns and reinforce positive beliefs:

*   "I love and accept myself exactly as I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   "I am deserving of love and respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   "I am confident and capable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   "I trust myself and my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

As you repeat these [[visualization_and_positive_affirmations | affirmations]], visualize them becoming a part of your being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. See yourself radiating with [[creating_a_positive_and_ empowering_selfimage | self-love]] and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Focusing on Release

Next, specifically focus on any negative thoughts or self-doubt that may be holding you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Acknowledge them, and then actively release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Visualize these thoughts dissipating like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Conclusion and Daily Practice

Finally, take a deep breath in and exhale slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. When you are ready, open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to feel gratitude for yourself and your progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Carry this sense of self-love and [[building_selfesteem_and_selfacceptance | self-esteem]] with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

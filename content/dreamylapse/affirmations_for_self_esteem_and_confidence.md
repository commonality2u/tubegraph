### Chakra Focus for Confidence
The meditation guides focus on specific chakras to enhance energy and self-perception:

*   **Root Chakra (Muladhara)**: Located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, symbolizing your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

*   **Releasing Negativity**: As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any [[releasing_negative_thoughts_and_selfdoubt | negative thoughts]] or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release any stress, tension, or anxiety, feeling your body and mind become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

*   **Sacral Chakra (Svadhisthana)**: Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area, radiating outwards and filling you with [[creating_a_positive_and_empowering_selfimage | confidence]] and [[building_selfesteem_and_selfacceptance | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Chakra Focus

### Root Chakra

Focus on your root chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Sacral Chakra

Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area, radiating outwards and filling you with confidence and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

As you focus on this chakra, repeat the following affirmations to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

This practice combines guided visualization with affirmations to cultivate a sense of confidence and self-worth.

## Beginning the Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds, and then exhaling through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Repeat this breathing process until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Activating Positive Energy

Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, filling you with positive energy and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Feel this energy flowing through your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Releasing Negativity

As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any negative thoughts or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to [[releasing_negative_thoughts_and_self_doubt | release any stress]], tension, or anxiety, feeling your body and mind become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Engaging the Sacral Chakra for Confidence

Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, positioned just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is linked to creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light radiating from this area, filling you with confidence and [[affirmations_for_self_esteem | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## The Inner Lighthouse Visualization

This [[meditation_techniques | meditation technique]] guides an individual through a progressive visualization:

### Setting the Scene
Begin by closing your eyes and taking a [[deep_breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | deep breath]] in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Imagine yourself standing at the edge of the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Picture waves rolling in, slow and steady, mirroring the rhythm of your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Discovering Your Inner Light
In the distance, a lighthouse appears to glow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This lighthouse is not an external structure but resides within you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This internal light is inherent and has "always been there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Fuelling the Light with Breath
Each breath taken fuels this inner light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As you inhale, imagine the light growing warmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. With each exhale, visualize any 'storm' or discomfort fading a little more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Managing Thoughts
Thoughts may arise during this practice, similar to waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The guidance is to "let them come" and "let them go," as they "cannot shake the lighthouse" within you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The inner lighthouse continues to "watch," "glow," and "endure" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Affirmations for Inner Peace
Alongside the visualization, incorporate affirmations to reinforce feelings of security and composure:
> "I am safe. I am steady. I am the calm inside the storm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

Couple these affirmations with [[breathing_techniques | breathing exercises]]: "Breathe in strength. Breathe out fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Concluding the Practice
After the visualization, take one more breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Gently return to your day, carrying the sense of your "light still burning" within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

This practice guides individuals to cultivate inner calm and build resilience through visualization and affirmation, often accompanied by background music. It emphasizes the importance of an internal source of strength that endures through challenges.

## The Practice: A Guided Visualization

The exercise begins by inviting participants to close their eyes and engage in [[deep_breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | deep breathing exercises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05"></a>. They are encouraged to imagine standing at the edge of the sea, observing waves that roll in "slow and steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24"></a>, mirroring the rhythm of their own breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>.

### The Inner Lighthouse Metaphor

A central element of this practice is the metaphor of an inner lighthouse. Participants are guided to visualize a lighthouse glowing not externally, but "inside you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49"></a>. This inner light is described as inherent, always having been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00"></a>. Each breath taken is said to fuel this light, causing it to grow warmer with inhales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10"></a> and making any internal "storm" fade a little more with exhales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16"></a>.

Even as thoughts may "rise like waves," the practice encourages letting them come and go, asserting that they "cannot shake the lighthouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44"></a>. The inner lighthouse "watches," "glows," and "endures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56"></a>.

### Affirmations for Resilience

Participants are prompted to use [[integrating_affiirmations_into_daily_practice_for_empowerment | affirmations]] to reinforce their sense of inner calm and resilience. Specific statements include:
*   "I am safe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11"></a>
*   "I am steady." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15"></a>
*   "I am the calm inside the storm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20"></a>

Further [[deep_breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | deep breathing exercises]] are integrated, instructing individuals to "breathe in strength" and "breathe out fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32"></a>. The practice concludes by gently guiding participants to return to their day, with their internal light "still burning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49"></a>.

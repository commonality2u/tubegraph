The experience of music can evoke a variety of direct emotional responses from listeners. These responses are frequently expressed through verbal exclamations and non-verbal cues.

## Expressed Sentiments

Throughout the observation, direct statements convey immediate reactions to the music:
*   Positive affirmation, such as "this is great," is a common response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>.
*   Conversely, negative reactions are also noted with phrases like "this isn't good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

## Sensory and Emotional Connection

A recurring phrase, "you touch me," suggests a profound sensory or emotional [[touch_and_connection_through_music | connection through music]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This phrase is repeated frequently, highlighting an impactful personal experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:27">[00:21:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:12">[00:24:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:02">[00:41:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:56">[00:46:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:10">[00:49:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:21">[00:55:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:25">[00:59:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>. This verbalization suggests the music is deeply affecting the listener, perhaps evoking a sense of empathy or profound resonance.

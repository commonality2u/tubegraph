This video segment primarily features [[music_for_relaxation | music]] throughout its duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:12">[00:26:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:39">[00:29:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>, and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. While the presence of [[music_for_relaxation | music]] may suggest its use for [[relaxation_through_music | relaxation]] or [[meditation_music | meditation]], no specific techniques for applying music to achieve relaxation are explicitly described or demonstrated within this particular segment. The audio also includes instances of laughter and applause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

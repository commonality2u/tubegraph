## Preparation

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

1.  Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
2.  Hold the breath for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  Exhale through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
4.  Repeat this process a few times until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Energy Visualization

Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, filling you with positive energy and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Feel this energy flow throughout your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Root Chakra Focus

Focus on your root chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This glow symbolizes your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Releasing Negativity

As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any negative thoughts or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release any stress, tension, or anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Feel your body and mind becoming lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Sacral Chakra and Affirmations

Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area, radiating outwards and filling you with confidence and [[selfesteem_and_energy_channel_opening | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

As you focus on this chakra, repeat the following [[reinforcing_positive_beliefs_through_repetition | affirmations]] to yourself:
*   "I am confident and masculine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   "My Sexual Energy is powerful and balanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   "I am worthy of love and affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Allow these [[benefits_of_positive_selftalk | affirmations]] to sink in and feel their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

Feel a sense of balance and harmony as your mind and body are brought into alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

When you're ready, take a final deep breath and slowly open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to appreciate the renewed sense of energy and vitality you feel, and carry this positive energy with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

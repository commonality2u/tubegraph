The concept of inner light and stability centers on cultivating a profound sense of [[inner_calm_and_resilience | inner calm and resilience]] through visualization and affirmations, akin to a lighthouse standing firm amidst the sea.

## The Lighthouse Within
This practice encourages visualizing oneself at the edge of the sea, where waves roll in like one's breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A key element is the imagination of a lighthouse not external, but glowing "inside you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This inner light "is yours" and "has always been there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Fueling the Light
The inner lighthouse is fueled by each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As one inhales, the light grows warmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, and with each exhale, any "storm" or turmoil within fades a little more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Navigating Thoughts
During this visualization, thoughts may surface "like waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The practice advises to [[visualization_for_releasing_negative_thoughts | let them come and let them go]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, acknowledging that they "cannot shake the lighthouse" within <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This internal lighthouse "watches, it glows, it endures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, representing an unwavering core.

## Affirmations for Stability
To reinforce this sense of stability and [[inner_calm_and_resilience | inner calm]], practitioners are encouraged to repeat affirmations. These include:
*   "I am safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   "I am steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   "I am the calm inside the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

This practice, which fosters [[cultivating_selflove_and_acceptance_through_affirmations | self-love and acceptance]] by breathing in strength and breathing out fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, aims to help individuals return to their day with their "light still burning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

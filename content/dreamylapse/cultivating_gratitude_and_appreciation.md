## How to Practice

To begin a gratitude meditation:
1.  **Find a Comfortable Position** Find a comfortable position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a> and close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
2.  **Regulate Your Breath** Take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs with air, and slowly exhale through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Allow your breath to become steady and calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  **Identify Sources of Gratitude** As you continue to breathe, bring to mind something for which you are grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This can be something small or big, tangible or intangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Allow yourself to fully feel the gratitude and appreciation for it, noticing the sensations in your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Fully embrace this feeling and let it fill your entire being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
5.  **Expand Your Gratitude** Continue to breathe and think of more things for which you are grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

6.  **Return to Awareness** Take one final deep breath in, and as you exhale, slowly open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Carry this feeling of gratitude and appreciation with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

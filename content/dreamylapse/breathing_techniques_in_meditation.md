Within meditation practices, such as a [[gratitude_meditation_practice | gratitude meditation]], specific [[breathing_exercises | breathing exercises]] are incorporated to foster a sense of gratitude and appreciation for the present moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Practice Instructions

To begin, participants are guided to find a comfortable position and close their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

*   **Inhale Deeply**: Take a deep breath in through the nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   **Exhale Slowly**: Fill the lungs with air and then slowly exhale through the mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
*   **Steady the Breath**: Allow the breath to become steady and calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Continued Breathing**: The practice continues with sustained breathing as one brings to mind things for which they are grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Concluding Breath**: The meditation concludes with one final deep breath in, followed by a slow exhale while opening the eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The regulation of breath is fundamental in allowing oneself to fully embrace feelings of gratitude and let them permeate one's entire being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

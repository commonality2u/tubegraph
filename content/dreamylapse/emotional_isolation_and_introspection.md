From: [[dreamylapse]] <br/> 

The narrator experiences a profound sense of [[inner calm | isolation]] and engages in deep introspection while navigating a rain-soaked city at night.

## Introspection and Lingering Questions
The rain never stopped, mirroring the incessant "questions in my head" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The night itself is described as "thick, like molasses and bad memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, suggesting a heavy mental state dominated by the past. The narrator's internal struggles are a constant companion, with the past "sit[ting] in the back seat and whisper[ing]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Feelings of Isolation and Brokenness
The narrator acknowledges that "Everyone had something to hide, including me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, contributing to a sense of pervasive guardedness. Trust is a valuable commodity in this town, but the narrator admits to being "always broke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> in this regard, highlighting a deep-seated inability to connect or rely on others. This lack of trust extends to individuals like Susan, whose eyes "told the whole story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> despite her words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The narrator felt increasingly enveloped by the night, which wrapped itself around them "like a velvet noose" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, a metaphor for growing isolation and despair.

## Philosophical and Cynical Outlook
The city, though unchanging, revealed its "rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> nature more clearly to the narrator over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. The case they are working on is depicted as lacking "heroes, just people trying not to drown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, reflecting a cynical view of humanity's struggles. Hope is deemed "a dangerous thing in a city built on regrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, a sentiment that the narrator tries not to carry too much of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This perspective suggests a coping mechanism of emotional detachment to avoid the pain associated with false hope. The rain's futile attempt to "wash the guilt off the sidewalks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a> symbolizes the enduring nature of guilt and the inability to escape past burdens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Even in the urban landscape, "Every street light cast a longer shadow than the man who walked beneath it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, and the narrator was "no exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>, illustrating a personal feeling of insignificance or being overshadowed by the gloom of their surroundings.

Ho'oponopono is a Hawaiian practice of reconciliation and forgiveness that has gained popularity in recent years as a self-help technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. It is a powerful tool for healing and transformation, both individually and in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The core of Ho'oponopono lies in four simple phrases:
*   I'm sorry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   Please forgive me <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   Thank you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>
*   I love you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

## Benefits of the Practice

These phrases are utilized to achieve several positive outcomes:
*   Clear negative energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
*   Heal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

From: [[dreamylapse]] <br/> 

The narrative explores a gritty urban landscape where trust is a rare commodity and deceit is a common practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The constant rain and the city's atmosphere contribute to a pervasive sense of unease and hidden truths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## A City of Secrets and Broken Trust

The unnamed city is depicted as a place where appearances are deceiving, and everyone harbors secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The city is described as "not sleeping, just pretending to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, suggesting a facade over a deeper, more complicated reality. The night itself is "thick, like molasses and bad memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, hinting at a past that continuously influences the present.

In this environment, "trust is a currency," and the narrator admits to being "always broke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, highlighting the scarcity and value of genuine trust.

## The Elusive Nature of Truth

The pursuit of truth is a central struggle, often proving to be fruitless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. The narrator states, "Every time I thought I had the truth, it slipped through my fingers like smoke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This difficulty is exemplified by encounters with individuals like Susan:
*   Susan claimed she knew nothing, yet "her eyes had already told the whole story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The narrator explicitly stated, "I didn't trust her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Susan's ability to deceive is described as her "weapon," with a smile "that made you want to believe her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Cases and Consequences of Deceit

The cases the narrator takes on are inherently steeped in deceit and poor judgment. A particular case "smelled like cheap whiskey and bad decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, indicating the morally ambiguous nature of the work. The narrator wasn't actively "looking for trouble," but trouble seemed to inevitably find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

The city's unchanging nature means the narrator simply became "better at seeing what was always rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, suggesting a deep-seated corruption or moral decay. These cases are devoid of heroes, featuring "just people trying not to drown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, implying a universal struggle against overwhelming circumstances, often brought on by their own or others' deceit.

The past in this city is not easily left behind; it "likes to sit in the back seat and whisper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, indicating how past actions and secrets continue to haunt its inhabitants. Hope is considered "a dangerous thing in a city built on regrets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, and the constant rain's failure to "wash the guilt off the sidewalks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a> reinforces the permanence of these moral stains.

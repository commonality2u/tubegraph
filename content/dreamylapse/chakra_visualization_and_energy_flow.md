To begin, find a comfortable seated position with your back straight and feet firmly planted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Focusing on the Root Chakra

Next, direct your focus to your root chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Allow yourself to release stress, tension, or anxiety, feeling your body and mind become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Focusing on the Sacral Chakra

Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, situated just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is linked to creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Affirmations for the Sacral Chakra

While focusing on the sacral chakra, repeat the following [[affirmations_for_each_chakra | affirmations]] to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

> I am worthy of love and affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Allow these affirmations to sink in and feel their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Energy Channel Alignment

Finally, take several deep breaths and visualize the [[energy_centers_alignment | energy channels]] in your body opening up and flowing freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Feel a sense of balance and harmony as your mind and body align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

When you are ready, take a final deep breath and slowly open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to appreciate the renewed sense of energy and vitality you feel, and carry this positive energy throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

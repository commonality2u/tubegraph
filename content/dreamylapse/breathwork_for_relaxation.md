Breathwork is a technique that can be used to cultivate inner calm and resilience, particularly for [[breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | relaxation]] and managing internal states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This practice often involves specific [[breathing_exercises in_meditation | breathing exercises]] and visualization to achieve a sense of safety and steadiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Core Practice

The initial step in this [[guided_meditation_techniques | guided meditation technique]] is to close your eyes and take a deep breath in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This sets the foundation for the practice, allowing you to focus inward.

### Visualization and Breath

A key element of this breathwork method involves visualization:
*   **Imagine the Sea:** Visualize yourself standing at the edge of the sea, where waves roll in slow and steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. These waves are likened to your own breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **The Inner Lighthouse:** In the distance, a lighthouse glows, but this light is perceived as being inside you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This internal light is inherent and has always been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Fueling the Light:** Each breath fuels this inner light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As you inhale, the light grows warmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. With each exhale, any internal "storm" or disturbance fades slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Managing Thoughts

During the practice, thoughts may arise, much like waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The instruction is to allow them to come and go, recognizing that they cannot shake the inner "lighthouse" or sense of stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The internal light watches, glows, and endures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Affirmations and Emotional Regulation

To reinforce the calming effect and aid in [[stress_and_anxiety_relief_through_meditation | stress and anxiety relief]], participants are encouraged to repeat affirmations:
*   "I am safe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   "I am steady." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   "I am the calm inside the storm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

The breath is also used as a tool for emotional regulation:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> "Breathe in strength. Breathe out fear."

## Conclusion of Practice

The session concludes with a final breath, encouraging a gentle return to the day with the inner light still burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

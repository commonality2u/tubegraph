Releasing negative thoughts involves a mindful practice that combines relaxation, visualization, and self-affirmation. This approach aims to create a clear and peaceful mind, fostering [[inner_calm_and_resilience|inner calm and resilience]] and self-love.

## Setting the Stage
To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds before releasing it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Repeat this process until your mind and body feel relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Visualization for Release
Next, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Visualize a warm, loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. As you exhale, consciously release any [[negative_energy_cleansing|negative thoughts or feelings]] you may be holding on to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Affirmations for a Positive Mindset
Reinforce your self-perception by repeating the following affirmations, either silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

*   "I love and accept myself exactly as I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   "I am deserving of love and respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   "I am confident and capable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   "I trust myself and my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

As you repeat these, visualize them becoming a part of your being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. See yourself radiating with self-love and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

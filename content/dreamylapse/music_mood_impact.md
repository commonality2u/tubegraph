The impact of music on mood is subtly indicated by direct expressions of sentiment during the musical piece. Listeners may experience a range of [[emotional responses to music]].

## Stated Emotional Responses

Throughout the audio, various exclamations suggest a direct, instantaneous impact on the listener's mood:
*   Positive sentiment is expressed with phrases like "this is great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:11">[00:20:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:26">[00:45:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:39">[00:49:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>, and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. The word "good" also appears as a positive descriptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:31">[01:02:31]</a>.
*   Conversely, negative sentiment is conveyed through phrases such as "this isn't good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:49">[00:23:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:40">[00:40:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:58">[00:57:58]</a>, and <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.

This guide outlines a meditation practice designed to enhance [[selfesteem_through_meditation_affirmations | self-esteem]] through [[positive_affirmations_for_mindset_shift | positive affirmations]] and [[visualization_for_self_acceptance | visualization]].

## Preparation for Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> before releasing it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Repeat this breathing exercise a few times until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Heart Center Visualization

Next, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with [[self_love_meditation_techniques | love and warmth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. As you exhale, release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Empowering Affirmations

Repeat the following [[positive_affirmations_for_mindset_shift | affirmations]] silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

> I love and accept myself exactly as I am <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
> I am deserving of [[cultivating_selflove_and_selfacceptance | love and respect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
> I am worthy of happiness and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
> I am confident and capable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
> I trust myself and my abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

As you repeat these [[empowering_statements_for_personal_growth | affirmations]], visualize them becoming a part of your being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. See yourself radiating with [[self_love_meditation_techniques | self-love]] and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Releasing Negativity

Focus on any [[releasing_negative_thoughts_and_self_doubt | negative thoughts]] or [[releasing_negative_thoughts_and_self_doubt | self-doubt]] that may be holding you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Acknowledge them and then release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Visualize them dissipating like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Concluding the Practice

Take a deep breath in and exhale slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. When you are ready, open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

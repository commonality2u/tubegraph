This meditation for men's health focuses on [[increasing_libido_and_positive_masculinity | increasing libido]], [[increasing_libido_and_positive_masculinity | positive masculinity]], self-esteem, and [[energy_centers_alignment | opening energy channels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Beginning the Meditation

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds before exhaling through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Repeat this breathing process until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Energy Visualization

Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, filling you with [[full_body_energy_cleanse | positive energy and vitality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Feel this energy flow throughout your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Chakra Focus

### Root Chakra

Next, focus on your root chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, symbolizing your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

As you continue deep breathing, visualize any [[negative_energy_cleansing | negative thoughts or feelings]] leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release any stress, tension, or anxiety, feeling your body and mind become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Sacral Chakra

Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and [[increasing_libido_and_positive_masculinity | positive masculinity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area, radiating outwards and filling you with confidence and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Affirmations for Self-Esteem

As you focus on the sacral chakra, repeat the following affirmations to yourself to enhance [[benefits_of_positive_selftalk | positive self-talk]] and [[visualization_for_self_confidence | self-confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

> "I am confident and masculine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
> "My Sexual Energy is powerful and balanced." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
> "I am worthy of love and affection." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Allow these affirmations to sink in and feel their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## Energy Channel Opening

Finally, take a few deep breaths and visualize the [[energy_centers_alignment | energy channels]] in your body opening up and flowing freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Feel a sense of balance and harmony as your mind and body are brought into [[energy_centers_alignment | alignment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

When ready, take a final deep breath and slowly open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to appreciate the renewed sense of [[inner_peace_and_vitality_through_meditation | energy and vitality]] you feel, and carry this positive energy with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

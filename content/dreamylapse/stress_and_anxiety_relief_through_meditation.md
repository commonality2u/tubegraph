## Beginning the Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position with a straight back and feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds before exhaling through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Repeat this [[breathing_exercises_in_meditation | breathing exercise]] until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Visualization and Energy Flow

Visualize a bright white light entering from the top of your head, filling your body with positive energy and [[inner_peace_and_vitality_through_meditation | vitality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Allow this energy to flow throughout your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Releasing Negative Energy

As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any negative thoughts or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This practice helps release stress, tension, and anxiety, allowing your body and mind to become lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Chakra Focus for Balance

### Root Chakra

Focus on your root chakra, located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, symbolizing your connection to the Earth and masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and strengthening with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Sacral Chakra

Next, direct your attention to your sacral chakra, situated just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is linked to creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light radiating outwards from this area, filling you with confidence and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Affirmations for Well-being

While focusing on the sacral chakra, repeat these affirmations:
*   "I am confident and masculine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   "My sexual energy is powerful and balanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   "I am worthy of love and affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Allow these affirmations to deepen their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

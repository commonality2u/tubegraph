To begin a practice for cultivating self-esteem through visualization and affirmations, start by finding a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Hold the breath for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, then release it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Repeat this breathing exercise a few times until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Heart Center Visualization

Bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. [[imagery_and_visualization_in_meditation | Visualize]] a warm and loving light radiating from your heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Releasing Negativity

As you exhale, release any [[letting_go_of_negative_thoughts_and_selfdoubt | negative thoughts]] or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Afterwards, focus on any [[letting_go_of_negative_thoughts_and_selfdoubt | negative thoughts]] or self-doubt that may be holding you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a> and then release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. See these thoughts dissipating like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

## Affirmations for Self-Esteem

After the visualization, repeat the following [[affirmations_for_selfesteem_and_confidence | affirmations]] to yourself, either silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   "I am confident and capable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   "I trust myself and my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Acknowledge these thoughts and then consciously release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

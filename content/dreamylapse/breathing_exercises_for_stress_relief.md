This [[guided_meditation_techniques | guided meditation]] utilizes [[breathing_techniques_in_meditation | breathing techniques in meditation]] and visualization to foster [[stress_and_anxiety_relief | stress and anxiety relief]] and internal calm. It incorporates [[music_for_relaxation | music for relaxation]] as a form of [[relaxation_techniques_with_music | relaxation techniques with music]].

## The Practice

The exercise begins by inviting you to close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> and take deep breaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Visualization of the Sea and Breath
You are guided to imagine standing at the edge of the sea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The waves roll in slowly and steadily, mirroring the rhythm of your breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### The Inner Lighthouse
A central element of this [[breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | breathing exercise]] is the visualization of a lighthouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This lighthouse is not external but glows inside you, representing an inherent light that has always been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Each breath taken is said to fuel this inner light <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Breath and Inner State
The practice links the breath to the internal state:
*   **Inhale**: The inner light grows warmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Exhale**: The metaphorical "storm" begins to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Acknowledging Thoughts
Thoughts may arise during the practice, compared to waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The instruction is to allow them to come and go, recognizing that they cannot "shake the lighthouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The lighthouse itself watches, glows, and endures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Affirmations
Participants are encouraged to repeat affirmations to reinforce feelings of security and stability:
*   "I am safe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   "I am steady." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   "I am the calm inside the storm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

The meditation concludes with a final emphasis on breathing in strength and breathing out fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, before gently returning to the day with the inner light still burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

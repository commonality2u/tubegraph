This [[guided_meditation_techniques | meditation]] for men's health aims to increase libido, foster positive masculinity, boost [[selfesteem_through_meditation_affirmations | self-esteem]], and open energy channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## How to Practice

### Setting Up
Begin by finding a comfortable seated position with your back straight and your feet firmly planted on the ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

### Breathing Exercise
Take a deep breath in through your nose, hold it for a few seconds, and then exhale through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Repeat this process until you feel relaxed and centered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Visualizing Positive Energy
Visualize a bright white light entering your body from the top of your head, filling you with positive energy and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Feel this energy flow through your entire body, revitalizing and nourishing every cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Focusing on the Root Chakra
Next, bring your attention to your root [[chakra_balancing_meditation | chakra]], which is located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Imagine a warm red glow emanating from this area, symbolizing your connection to the Earth and your masculine energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Visualize this energy expanding and growing stronger with each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Releasing Negativity
As you continue to breathe deeply, visualize any negative thoughts or feelings leaving your body with each exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Allow yourself to release any [[stress_relief_through_meditation | stress]], tension, or anxiety, and feel your body and mind becoming lighter and more relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Focusing on the Sacral Chakra
Now, bring your attention to your sacral [[chakra_balancing_meditation | chakra]], located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This [[chakra_balancing_meditation | chakra]] is associated with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area, radiating outwards and filling you with confidence and [[selfesteem_through_meditation_affirmations | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

#### Affirmations
As you focus on your sacral [[chakra_balancing_meditation | chakra]], repeat the following affirmations to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

*   "I am confident and masculine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>
*   "My Sexual Energy is powerful and balanced" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>
*   "I am worthy of love and affection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>

Allow these affirmations to sink in and feel their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Opening Energy Channels
Finally, take a few deep breaths and visualize the energy channels in your body opening up and flowing freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Feel a sense of balance and harmony as your mind and body are brought into alignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Concluding
When you're ready, take a final deep breath and slowly open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to appreciate the renewed sense of energy and vitality you feel, and carry this positive energy with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## The Breathing Technique

1.  Take a deep breath in through your nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
2.  Hold your breath for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
3.  Release the breath slowly through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
4.  Repeat this process a few times until you feel your mind and body beginning to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Integrating Visualization and Affirmations

Once relaxed, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

*   As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This is an example of [[using_breath_to_fuel_inner_light|using breath to fuel inner light]].
*   As you exhale, consciously release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. See them dissipate like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Repeat the following affirmations silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
*   "I love and accept myself exactly as I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   "I am deserving of love and respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   "I am confident and capable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   "I trust myself and my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Visualize these affirmations becoming a part of your being, seeing yourself radiating with self-love and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Focus on any negative thoughts or self-doubt that may be holding you back, acknowledge them, and then release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Concluding the Practice

To conclude, take a deep breath in and exhale slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. When ready, open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to feel gratitude for yourself and your progress, carrying this sense of self-love and self-esteem throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Remember, self-love is a practice that requires patience and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Through consistent practice, you will come to love and accept yourself fully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

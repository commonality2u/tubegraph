To begin a [[breathing_exercises_for_stress_relief | relaxation]] practice, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Basic Breathing Technique
Take a deep breath in through your nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Hold it for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, then release it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Repeat this process several times until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Integrating Visualization and Affirmations
While continuing with the [[breathing techniques in meditation | breathing techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Inhale and Exhale Intentions
*   As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   As you exhale, release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Self-Affirmations
Repeat the following affirmations silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
*   "I love and accept myself exactly as I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   "Deserving of love and respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
*   "I am confident and capable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   "I trust myself in my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

Visualize these affirmations becoming a part of your being, seeing yourself radiating with self-love and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Releasing Negativity
Focus on any negative thoughts or self-doubt that may be holding you back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, and then release them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. See them dissipating like clouds in the sky, leaving behind a clear and peaceful mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Concluding the Practice
Take a deep breath in and exhale slowly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. When you are ready, open your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Take a moment to feel gratitude for yourself and your progress, and carry this sense of self-love and self-esteem with you throughout your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

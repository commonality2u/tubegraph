From: [[dreamylapse]] <br/> 

The city setting is one where [[urban_mystery_and_intrigue | mystery and intrigue]] are prevalent, and deception is a fundamental aspect of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The protagonist experiences nights filled with questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, driving through a city that isn't truly sleeping, but merely "pretending to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This environment is described as "thick, like molasses and bad memories," suggesting a pervasive sense of hidden burdens and moral decay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Hiding Truths

In this town, everyone has something to conceal, including the narrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Trust is a valuable commodity, acting as a "currency" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, and the narrator is metaphorically "broke," indicating a struggle with or lack of trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The truth is elusive, constantly slipping "like smoke" through one's fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Susan: An Embodiment of Deception

A character named Susan exemplifies the theme of deception. Despite her verbal denials, her eyes betray her words, revealing "the whole story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The narrator explicitly states a lack of trust in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Susan's entrance into the narrator's life is described as a "bad idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Her smile, which inspires belief, is identified as her "weapon" for manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## The Nature of the City and Its Cases

The environment of the city is characterized by its unchanging nature, where the narrator simply becomes more adept at discerning the inherent "rotten" elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Cases in this city lack heroes and are populated by individuals merely trying to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The past, rather than being forgotten, "likes to sit in the back seat and whisper," implying that past deceptions and truths continue to haunt the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

The particular case the narrator is working on is described as smelling "like cheap whiskey and bad decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The narrator recognized it as "trouble" immediately upon opening the file, noting that trouble seems to have a knack for finding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Hope and Regret

[[hope_and_regret_in_city_life | Hope]] is considered a dangerous sentiment in a city "built on regrets," leading the narrator to carry as little of it as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Even the rain, which falls incessantly, seems to be attempting to cleanse the "guilt off the sidewalks," though it is ultimately futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. In this shadowy urban landscape, every street light casts a longer shadow than the person walking beneath it, indicating that even the narrator is not exempt from the overarching darkness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

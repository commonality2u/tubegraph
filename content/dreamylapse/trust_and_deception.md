From: [[dreamylapse]] <br/> 

The city depicted is a place where trust is a rare commodity and deception is pervasive. Everyone seems to have something to hide, including the narrator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Trust is described as a "currency," but the narrator admits to always being "broke" in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:45">[00:35:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

## The Elusive Truth

The narrator frequently finds that the truth is hard to grasp, slipping "through my fingers like smoke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:58">[00:36:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:21">[00:53:21]</a>. This indicates an environment where facts are obscured or actively hidden.

## Deceptive Characters

A key figure, Susan, is presented as inherently untrustworthy. Despite her claims of knowing "nothing," her eyes betray the "whole story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:31">[00:53:31]</a>. The narrator explicitly states, "I didn't trust her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. Susan's "kind of smile that made you want to believe her" is identified as her "weapon," suggesting a manipulative charm used to deceive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>.

## A City of Secrets

The city itself is described as "rotten," implying a deep-seated corruption or deceit that the narrator has become adept at recognizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:04">[00:26:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:29">[00:42:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>. The past, rather than being forgotten, "likes to sit in the back seat and whisper," suggesting lingering secrets and unresolved deceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:38">[00:42:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:03">[00:59:03]</a>.

The idea of "hope" is considered "dangerous" in this city built on "regrets," hinting at the futility of seeking genuine or positive outcomes in a deceptive environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:02">[00:44:02]</a>. Attempts to "wash the guilt off the sidewalks" with rain are futile, reinforcing the idea that deep-seated secrets and wrongdoings cannot be easily cleansed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:44">[00:27:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>.

Even the narrator acknowledges being part of this deceptive landscape, stating that every street light cast a longer shadow than the man beneath it, and "I was no exception" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:13">[00:45:13]</a>. This suggests that everyone, including the protagonist, harbors hidden aspects or participates in the city's culture of [[crime_and_investigation | secrets and deception]].

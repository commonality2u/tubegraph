## Preparing for the Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Hold it for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, then release it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Repeat this process a few times until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Heart Center Visualization

Bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## The Practice of Gratitude

To begin, find a comfortable position, close your eyes, and take a deep breath in through your nose, filling your lungs with air, then slowly exhaling through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Allow your breath to become steady and calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

As you continue to breathe, bring to mind something for which you are grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This can be something small or large, tangible or intangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Allow yourself to fully feel the gratitude and appreciation for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Notice the sensations in your body as you feel grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Take a moment to express your gratitude, perhaps by silently saying "thank you" or offering a prayer of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Fully embrace this feeling of gratitude and let it fill your entire being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Continue to think of more things for which you are grateful, allowing yourself to feel the warmth and joy that comes with each expression of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Conclude the practice by taking one final deep breath in and slowly opening your eyes as you exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

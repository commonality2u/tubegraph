This meditation practice guides individuals towards cultivating mindfulness and self-awareness by connecting with an inner sense of calm and resilience.

## The Practice
The exercise begins by inviting participants to close their eyes and take deep breaths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It then encourages imagining oneself standing at the edge of the sea, observing waves that roll in slowly and steadily, mirroring one's own breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### The Inner Lighthouse
A key element of this practice is the visualization of a lighthouse that glows not externally, but *inside* oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This inner light is described as belonging to the individual and having always been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Each breath taken is said to fuel this light; an inhale makes the light grow warmer, and an exhale causes the surrounding "storm" to fade slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Observing Thoughts
The practice emphasizes observing thoughts as they arise, much like waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Participants are encouraged to "let them come" and "let them go," understanding that these thoughts cannot shake the steadfastness of the inner lighthouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The inner light "watches, glows, [and] endures," signifying an unwavering core of self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Affirmations for [[inner_calm_and_resilience | Inner Calm and Resilience]]
To reinforce self-awareness and [[inner_calm_and_resilience | inner calm and resilience]], participants are guided to repeat affirmations to themselves:
*   "I am safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   "I am steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   "I am the calm inside the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

The meditation concludes with a focus on breathing in strength and breathing out fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, encouraging a gentle return to the day with one's inner light still burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

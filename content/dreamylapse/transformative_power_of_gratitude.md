The breath should become steady and calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

As you breathe, bring to mind something for which you are grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Allow this feeling of gratitude to fully embrace and fill your entire being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. As you continue to breathe, think of more things to be grateful for, allowing yourself to feel the warmth and joy that comes with each expression of gratitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The video prominently features continuous background music throughout its duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While the specific genre or characteristics of this music are not explicitly stated within the transcript, its presence suggests it could be intended for purposes such as [[relaxation_techniques_using_music | relaxation techniques using music]] or [[music_and_relaxation_techniques | music and relaxation techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

Vocalizations such as "touch me" are interspersed with the music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, alongside exclamations like "this is great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> and "this isn't good" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Laughter is also occasionally heard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:32">[00:20:32]</a>, and the word "foreign" appears multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

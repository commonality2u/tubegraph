Chakra balancing meditation is a practice focused on aligning and harmonizing the [[seven_main_chakras | seven main chakras]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This meditation involves working upwards from the root chakra at the base of the spine to the crown chakra at the top of the head <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

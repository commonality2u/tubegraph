Within a [[chakra_balancing_meditation | chakra balancing meditation]] practice, attention is directed to harmonizing the body's main energy centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This includes the sacral chakra, which is located just below the navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Visualization and Affirmation

While focusing on this orange light, an affirmation is repeated: "I am creative and passionate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This practice is part of a sequence that moves up the body, starting from the [[root_chakra_alignment | root chakra]] and ascending to the [[crown_chakra_connection | crown chakra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

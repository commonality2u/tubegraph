## Integrating Gratitude
As you continue to breathe, bring to mind something for which you are grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This can be something small or large, tangible or intangible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Allow yourself to fully feel the gratitude and appreciation, noticing the sensations in your body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. You can express your gratitude by saying a silent "thank you" or offering a prayer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Continue this process, thinking of more things to be grateful for, and allowing the warmth and joy of each expression of gratitude to fill you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Conclude the meditation with a final deep breath, slowly opening your eyes as you exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

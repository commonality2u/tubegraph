*   "this is great" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

The presence of music throughout the video suggests the use of [[sensual_music_as_a_mood_setter | sensual music as a mood setter]] or for general [[relaxation using music | relaxation]]. The phrases "you touch me" and "this is great" could be interpreted as responses to the auditory experience provided by the music.

These techniques help establish a calm and steady state for the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Basic Breath Control Steps

To begin, find a comfortable sitting position and close your eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

1.  **Inhale deeply through the nose** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
2.  **Fill your lungs with air** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
3.  **Slowly exhale through your mouth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Allow your breath to become steady and calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Continue this breathing pattern throughout the practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. To conclude, take one final deep breath in and slowly open your eyes as you exhale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

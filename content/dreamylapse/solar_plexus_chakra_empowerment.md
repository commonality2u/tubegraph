## Location and Visualization
The solar plexus chakra is located in your abdomen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:37">[02:41:37]</a>. During meditation, it is visualized as a shining yellow ball of light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:87">[02:50:87]</a>.

## Affirmation for Empowerment
To empower this chakra, one repeats the affirmation: "I am confident and empowered" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:77">[02:53:77]</a>.

## Purpose within Chakra Balancing

By balancing these energy centers, individuals can experience inner peace, clarity, and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:77">[01:03:77]</a>.

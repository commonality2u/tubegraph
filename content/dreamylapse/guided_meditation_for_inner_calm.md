This [[meditation | guided meditation]] focuses on cultivating inner calm through visualization and breathwork, encouraging individuals to find their stable center amidst internal "storms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It is one of several [[practices_for_stress_relief_and_inner_peace | practices for stress relief and inner peace]] that can be used.

## The Practice

The [[meditation techniques | practice]] begins by asking participants to close their eyes and take a [[deep_breathing_exercises_for_relaxation | deep breath]] in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Core Visualization: The Sea and the Inner Lighthouse

Participants are encouraged to imagine standing at the edge of the sea, where waves roll in slow and steady, mirroring their breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

A key element of this [[meditation | meditative soundscape]] is the imagery of a lighthouse. This lighthouse is not an external structure, but one that glows inside the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This internal light is described as being inherent and ever-present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Each breath taken during the [[meditation | practice]] is said to fuel this inner light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:
*   **Inhale:** The light grows warmer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Exhale:** Any internal "storm" is encouraged to fade just a little more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### [[managing_intrusive_thoughts_during_meditation | Managing Thoughts]]

During the [[meditation | practice]], thoughts may arise "like waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The guidance suggests acknowledging these thoughts, letting them come and go, without allowing them to "shake the lighthouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The inner lighthouse is portrayed as watching, glowing, and enduring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Affirmations for Steadiness

The [[meditation | meditation]] incorporates affirmations to reinforce a sense of safety and stability:
> "I am safe. I am steady. I am the calm inside the storm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

Further breathing instructions encourage participants to "breathe in strength" and "breathe out fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Concluding the Meditation

The [[meditation | session]] concludes by guiding participants to gently return to their day, with the intention that their inner light continues to burn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

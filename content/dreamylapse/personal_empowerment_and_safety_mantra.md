A personal empowerment and safety mantra utilizes guided visualization and spoken affirmations to cultivate inner strength and resilience, allowing an individual to navigate challenges while maintaining [[inner_calm_and_resilience | inner calm and resilience]]. This practice, which can be considered one of several [[positive_mindset_cultivation_techniques | Positive Mindset Cultivation Techniques]], helps to anchor a sense of safety and steadiness within oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## The Visualization Practice

The exercise begins by closing the eyes and taking a deep breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Participants are guided to imagine standing at the edge of the sea, where waves roll in slowly and steadily, mirroring one's own breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### The Inner Lighthouse

A key element of this visualization is the "inner lighthouse," which is not external but glows *inside* the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This light is inherent, always present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, and is fueled by each breath <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. As one inhales, the light grows warmer, and with each exhale, any internal "storm" begins to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Handling Thoughts

During the visualization, thoughts may arise "like waves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The practice encourages allowing these thoughts to come and go without resistance, emphasizing that they cannot "shake the lighthouse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This approach is beneficial for [[overcoming_negative_thoughts_and_self_doubt | overcoming negative thoughts and self-doubt]], as the inner light is seen to watch, glow, and endure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The Mantra and Affirmation

Central to this practice is a specific mantra, which can be considered a form of [[how_to_practice_daily_affirmations | daily affirmation]]. The mantra states:

> "I am safe. I am steady. I am the calm inside the storm." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

Following this affirmation, the practice concludes with breathing in "strength" and breathing out "fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The aim is to gently return to the day with this inner light still burning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This technique supports [[overcoming_challenges_with_affirmations | overcoming challenges with affirmations]] by reinforcing a strong, inner sense of self.

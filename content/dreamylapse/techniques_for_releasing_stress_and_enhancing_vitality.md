### Sacral Chakra Focus
Bring your attention to your sacral chakra, located just below your navel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This chakra is associated with creativity, sexuality, and positive masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Visualize a vibrant orange light emanating from this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, radiating outwards and filling you with confidence and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Affirmations
As you focus on the sacral chakra, repeat the following affirmations to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>:

> I am confident and masculine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

> I am worthy of love and affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Allow these affirmations to sink in and feel their positive impact on your mind and body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This can be part of [[improving_relationships_with_selfhelp_techniques | improving relationships with selfhelp techniques]].

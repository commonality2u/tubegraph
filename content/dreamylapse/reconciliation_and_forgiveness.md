Ho'oponopono is a Hawaiian practice focused on reconciliation and forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. In recent years, it has gained recognition as a self-help technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The core of the practice involves the repetition of four simple phrases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>:
*   "I'm sorry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>
*   "Please forgive me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>
*   "Thank you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>
*   "I love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>

The narrative explores the interplay of hope and regret within a dark, unforgiving urban landscape. The city itself seems to embody a history of past missteps and unresolved issues.

## The Haunting Nature of the Past
The city's nights are described as "thick, like molasses and bad memories" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The protagonist experiences "questions in my head" that persist through the night, much like the ceaseless rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. A recurring sentiment is that "the city didn't change. I just got better at seeing what was always rotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This perspective highlights a pervasive sense of decay and the lasting impact of history.

The past is not merely behind the inhabitants; it "likes to sit in the back seat and whisper" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, indicating a constant, inescapable presence of past actions and their consequences.

## Regret and Guilt
The narrative is tinged with the consequences of "bad decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, suggesting a pervasive atmosphere of [[trust_and_deception | regret]]. The protagonist notes that "some nights the rain feels like it's trying to wash the guilt off the sidewalks. It never works" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>, illustrating the enduring and unshakeable nature of guilt within this environment. The cases investigated "had no heroes, just people trying not to drown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, further emphasizing a world where individuals are mired in their circumstances, often due to past choices.

## The Peril of Hope
In a city described as "built on regrets," hope is portrayed as a "dangerous thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The protagonist actively "tried not to carry too much of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, suggesting that in this harsh reality, hope can lead to vulnerability or further disappointment rather than solace. The persistent difficulties and the elusive nature of truth—slipping "through my fingers like smoke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>—reinforce the idea that a hopeful outlook may be impractical or even detrimental.

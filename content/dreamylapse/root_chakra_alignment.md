[[Chakra balancing meditation | Balancing meditation]] practices often begin by focusing on the root chakra <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. This practice aims to align and harmonize the seven main chakras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. By balancing these energy centers, one can experience a sense of inner peace, clarity, and vitality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Location and Visualization
The root chakra is located at the base of your spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. To focus on it, envision a bright red ball of light in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This chakra can be visualized spinning and glowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Affirmation
As part of the alignment process, it is suggested to repeat the affirmation:
> I am grounded and secure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

## Practice for Alignment
To prepare for this focus, close your eyes and take a deep breath, allowing yourself to relax and release any tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Visualize a beam of white light shining down, enveloping you in its healing energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. After focusing on the root chakra, attention then moves upwards to other chakras, including the [[Sacral chakra visualization | sacral chakra]], [[Solar plexus chakra empowerment | solar plexus chakra]], heart chakra, throat chakra, third eye chakra, and finally the [[Crown chakra connection | crown chakra]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

After the practice, one can feel balanced, centered, and aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Letting go of negative thoughts and self-doubt is a practice that requires patience and dedication, ultimately leading to self-love and self-acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This process involves a combination of relaxation, visualization, and [[affirmations for selfacceptance and confidence | affirmations]] to clear the mind and foster a more positive self-image.

## Preparation and Relaxation
Begin by finding a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take deep breaths, inhaling through your nose and releasing through your mouth, repeating until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Cultivating Positive Energy
Bring your attention to your heart center and visualize a warm, loving light radiating outwards, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This visualization aids in [[cultivating_a_positive_selfimage_and_mindset | fostering a positive self-image]] and inner peace.

## Releasing Negativity
As you exhale, consciously release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This mindful release is a key part of the process.

## Affirmations for Self-Acceptance
Repeat the following [[affirmations_for_selfacceptance_and_confidence | affirmations]] silently or out loud to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
*   "I love and accept myself exactly as I am" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   "I am deserving of love and respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   "I am worthy of happiness and success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

*   "I trust myself and my abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

As you repeat these, visualize them becoming a part of your being, seeing yourself radiating with self-love and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

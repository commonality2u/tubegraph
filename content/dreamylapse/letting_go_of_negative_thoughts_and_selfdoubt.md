Letting go of negative thoughts and self-doubt is a practice that promotes inner calm and resilience, cultivating a sense of [[importance_of_practicing_selflove_and_gratitude|self-love]] and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This process involves focused relaxation, visualization, and the use of [[how_affirmations_can_rewire_thinking_patterns|affirmations]] to transform your mindset.

## Preparing for the Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Hold your breath for a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, then release it slowly through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Repeat this breathing exercise several times until your mind and body begin to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Visualizing Self-Love and Warmth

Next, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from your heart, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. As you exhale, release any negative thoughts or feelings you may be holding on to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Affirming Your Worth

Repeat the following [[affirmations_for_selfesteem_and_confidence|affirmations]] to yourself, either silently or out loud, allowing them to become a part of your being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

During a [[guided_meditation_for_inner_calm | guided meditation]], it is common for thoughts to emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The approach to these thoughts is not to suppress them, but rather to observe them without attachment.

## Allowing Thoughts to Pass

Thoughts may rise like waves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The guidance is to "let them come. Let them go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This acknowledges their presence without allowing them to disrupt the inner state of calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## The Inner Lighthouse Metaphor

A core visualization used in [[meditation]] to manage thoughts involves a lighthouse:
*   **The Lighthouse as Inner Self** Imagine a lighthouse glowing inside you, representing your core being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This light is an inherent part of you and has always been present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   **Thoughts as Waves/Storms** Just as waves roll in slow and steady <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, thoughts may rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. While a storm might be present, the inner lighthouse remains unshaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, watching, glowing, and enduring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   **Fueling the Light** Each breath fuels this inner light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Inhaling helps the light grow warmer, while exhaling contributes to the fading of the storm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This practice aids in [[letting_go_of_negative_thoughts_and_selfdoubt | letting go of fear]] and embracing strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Affirmations for Stability

To reinforce the mind's ability to remain steady amidst intrusive thoughts, affirmations can be used as [[practices_for_stress_relief_and_inner_peace | practices for inner peace]]:
*   "I am safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>
*   "I am steady" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>
*   "I am the calm inside the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

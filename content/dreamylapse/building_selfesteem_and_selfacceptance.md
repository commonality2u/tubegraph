This guide outlines a meditative practice for cultivating these qualities.

## Preparing for the Practice

To begin, find a comfortable seated position in a quiet space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Close your eyes and take a deep breath in through your nose, holding it for a few seconds before releasing it through your mouth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Repeat this breathing exercise a few times until your mind and body start to relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Heart Center Visualization

Next, bring your attention to your heart center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Visualize a warm and loving light radiating from this area, spreading throughout your entire body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. As you inhale, imagine this light growing brighter and more intense, filling you with love and warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Repeat the following [[affirmations_for_self_esteem_and_confidence | affirmations for self-esteem and confidence]] silently or out loud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:

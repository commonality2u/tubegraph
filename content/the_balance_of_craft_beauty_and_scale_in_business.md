Patrick Collison, CEO of Stripe, discusses the often-competing, yet complementary, values of craft, beauty, scale, and speed in the context of building successful and enduring businesses. He emphasizes that while these elements can be in tension, an appreciation for craft and beauty is increasingly crucial, even for large-scale operations.

## The Triad: Craft, Scale, and Speed

Collison acknowledges the common tension between craft, scale, and speed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:52">[01:02:52]</a> He notes that while not always strictly opposed, they are "definitely frequently intentioned." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a> However, he suggests that the pursuit of craft might be "as important as it's ever been." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:58">[01:03:58]</a>

### The Enduring Importance of Craft
Despite the pressures of growth and velocity, Collison argues that many of the most successful companies are distinguished by their appreciation for and skill in realizing craft and beauty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>

## Valuing Aesthetics and Beauty

Aesthetic qualities, though "generally speaking unquantifiable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>, significantly influence people. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a>

### Impact on People and Customers
People demonstrably care about aesthetics, and companies care about the aesthetic characteristics of their products. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:42">[01:04:42]</a> Collison states that Stripe has come to a greater conviction in the importance of these qualities, even in a B2B domain, by observing customer responses over its 14-year history. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:16">[01:05:16]</a>

### Unquantifiable yet Influential
The difficulty in managing aesthetics at an organizational level lies in their unquantifiable nature; there isn't a direct P&L associated with them, and declines are not easily tracked through time series data. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:02">[01:05:02]</a>

### Attracting Top Talent
A strong emphasis on craft is crucial for attracting the best talent. Collison posits that "the best people consider themselves craftspeople in their domain and they really, above almost all else, want to work with the best other people." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:48">[01:05:48]</a> He suggests that even if customers didn't value craft, an organization might still want to prioritize it to attract top individuals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a> It's "very hard to assemble groups of the best people if you don't take the practice of the work super seriously." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:21">[01:06:21]</a>

## Craft in Practice: Stripe's Approach

Stripe has increasingly focused on craft as it has scaled. [[stripes_growth_strategy_and_impact_on_global_markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>

### API Design as Enduring Architecture
Collison highlights the underappreciated discipline of API design, noting its significant role in the fate of platforms. [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:54">[01:09:54]</a>
*   **The Mathematica Analogy**: He compares Stripe to Mathematica, viewing both as selling a "self-contained universe to model whatever it is of interest to you," providing primitives and tools for users to work on their own terms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:43">[01:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a> Like Mathematica, Stripe takes backward compatibility seriously, which raises the stakes for initial API design. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>
*   **Multi-Decadal Abstractions**: Stripe aims to create "multi-decadal abstractions," emphasizing that well-designed APIs can endure for decades, providing long-term benefits to users. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a> This requires thinking about how the world might evolve to ensure coherence over time, such as considering if an API can be stood behind in 2044. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>

### Balancing Speed and Reliability
Stripe focuses on craft to attract the best software developers, who generally dislike slow development cycles and being paged for incidents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:52">[01:35:52]</a> The company aims to enable fast iteration without outages, deploying core production services around 1,000 times a day with approximately 99.9995% reliability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:11">[01:37:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:25">[01:37:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:54">[01:37:54]</a> This requires significant investment in processes and operational excellence, which Collison believes doesn't always get enough cultural credit in the tech industry.

## Craft in Interface vs. Implementation

The relative importance of craft in interface versus implementation depends on the product. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>
*   For a product like TikTok, a simple interface is paramount, even if the implementation is complex. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>
*   For Stripe, users are, on some level, "purchasing our architecture." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:06">[01:07:06]</a> Collison sees the interface to Stripe as being its architecture, making the two less separable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:13">[01:08:13]</a>

## Lessons from Other Industries

Collison cites several companies and systems as examples of excelling in craft or creating enduring designs:
*   **Companies Excelling in Craft**:
    *   **LVMH**: Their entire business is built on craft and beauty. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>
    *   **Tesla**: Noted for being "pretty good at this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>
    *   **Apple**: An "obvious" example. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>
    *   **TSMC**: Likened to a "chip sushi chef" with significant tacit knowledge and difficult-to-transfer skills. [[semiconductor_industry_and_trade_secrets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>
*   **Enduring API/Architectural Design**:
    *   **Unix**: Successful due to a simple implementation, with an architecture that has worked for over half a century despite shortcomings. [[large_language_models_and_transfer_learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:04">[01:11:04]</a>
    *   **iOS Development (NS Prefix)**: Many objects and classes in iOS development, prefixed with "NS" (referring to NeXTSTEP from the 90s), demonstrate how API design can endure for decades even amidst rapid evolution.

    *   **Mathematica**: Takes backward compatibility seriously, allowing programs written 20 years ago to run unchanged. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>

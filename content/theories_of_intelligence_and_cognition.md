This article explores various theories related to intelligence, cognition, and computation, based on a discussion with David Deutsch. It covers the nature of artificial general intelligence (AGI) in comparison to human intelligence, the roles of hardware and software, animal cognition, the limits of computation, and the dynamics of knowledge creation.

## Defining General Intelligence: Human and Artificial

Deutsch anticipates that Artificial General Intelligences (AGIs) will be no more fundamentally intelligent than humans [[human_and_ai_intelligence_comparison | human and AI intelligence comparison]].

### Cognitive Equivalence
"Fundamentally intelligent" is defined as being capable of all the same types of cognition as humans are, in principle. This includes activities such as doing science, creating art, and potentially experiencing emotions like falling in love, as well as having the capacity for good and evil [[human_intelligence_vs_neural_network_intelligence | human intelligence vs neural network intelligence]].

### The Principle of Universality
The reasoning for this anticipated equivalence is twofold, based on considerations of computation hardware and software. Ultimately, Deutsch suggests that AGIs and humans will have the same "range" in their cognitive capabilities [[neuroscience_and_ai_understanding_intelligence | neuroscience and AI: understanding intelligence]].

## The Hardware of Intelligence

### Brains as Turing-Complete Systems
Human brains are considered Turing-complete pieces of hardware. This means they can, in principle, run any computable function or program.

### Limitations and Augmentability
The ability to run "any" program is practically constrained by factors like lifespan, speed of computation, and memory capacity. However, Deutsch posits that humans are not limited in the *types* of programs they can run, apart from these constraints of speed and memory [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs | AI scalability and breakthroughs]]. Both speed and memory can be augmented to the level of any other entity in the universe [[human_enhancement_and_intelligence_augmentation | human enhancement and intelligence augmentation]]. If a faster computer is built, that technology could theoretically be used to enhance human thinking speed.

### Specialized Cognitive Hardware
The idea that certain concepts or qualia (e.g., love, advanced scientific concepts beyond current human grasp) might require specialized hardware that humans lack (as suggested by Martin Rees regarding extraterrestrial intelligence) is addressed. Deutsch argues that any such "specialized hardware" would still be a form of computer [[innovations_and_challenges_in_ai_hardware | innovations and challenges in AI hardware]]. If a part of the brain responsible for a specific function like experiencing love or mathematical insight were missing, an artificial device could, in principle, compute the necessary signals and chemical adjustments to replicate that function, making it indistinguishable from the biological counterpart.

## The Software of Intelligence

### The Concept of Universal Explainers

A key question is whether all humans are capable of explaining everything that the smartest humans can explain.

#### Literacy, Complex Tasks, and Innate Capability
The observation that a significant percentage of the population struggles with basic literacy tasks like identifying an expiry date on a driver's license is raised [[the_role_of_selfteaching_and_motivation_in_education | the role of self-teaching and motivation in education]]. Deutsch notes these are tasks no ape could do. For such a large portion of the population, he suggests the limitation is "definitely not hardware" but rather a software issue, unless it's a case of severe brain damage.

#### The Role of Motivation and Conceptual Readiness
The software challenge isn't merely about "wanting to" learn or be taught, but about whether the existing software (mindset, current knowledge) is "conceptually ready". Deutsch uses the example of Brett Hall, who would like to speak Mandarin Chinese but may never want it enough to go through the arduous process of acquiring that program, despite no inherent hardware or software (beyond this specific "want") preventing him. Circumstances can change this "want," as seen with relatives forced to learn new languages after migration [[the_significance_of_good_explanations_in_learning_complex_subjects | the significance of good explanations in learning complex subjects]]. Thus, individuals struggling with basic literacy could learn if they "wanted to" with similar intensity, assuming no underlying severe hardware dysfunction.

#### Cultural and Contextual Factors in Learning
Learning complex subjects like quantum computing for someone currently not functionally literate would involve more than just language acquisition. It requires learning the broader "culture" of that knowledge domain, including concepts from physics, mathematics, and logic [[the_role_of_cultural_and_technological_innovations_in_human_evolution | the role of cultural and technological innovations in human evolution]]. Individuals from pre-Enlightenment cultures, for instance, would need to learn a whole range of civilizational concepts, not just the language of science, to understand quantum computers. Similarly, those who can't read driving licenses are, in a sense, in a different culture they would need to acculturate to.

### Genetic Influences on Software
Software can be genetic, meaning it's present from the beginning, but this does not imply it's immutable.

### Interpreting Correlations: IQ, Performance, and Twin Studies
The observation that people with lower literacy also tend to choose less "cognitively demanding" jobs or score lower on IQ tests is presented as evidence for hardware differences. Deutsch counters that labeling jobs as "cognitively demanding" begs the question, and these are often "software choices" influenced by cultural valuation [[impact_of_culture_and_environment_on_intelligence | impact of culture and environment on intelligence]]. Cultures and societal structures (e.g., company practices) are often built to utilize and cater to abilities common among the educated population, leading to correlations that might be misinterpreted as purely hardware-driven.

Regarding twin studies showing high IQ correlation for identical twins reared apart, Deutsch argues that correlations are ubiquitous and don't inherently prove causation by the measured variable (genetics/hardware in this case). There could be unobserved, uncontrolled variables (e.g., subtle aspects of early childhood treatment correlated with twinness) that are the true determinants [[challenges_and_limitations_in_ai_interpretability_and_safety | challenges and limitations in AI interpretability and safety]]. Parents process vast amounts of information about their children, much of it unconsciously, which could influence development in ways not captured by simple genetic models.

## Animal Cognition vs. Human Creativity

### Sophisticated Programming vs. Explanatory Creativity
Animals possess amazing instinctive knowledge, encoded in their genes, which allows them to thrive in environments they've never seen before. A wolf navigating a forest and hunting prey exhibits complex strategies in novel situations. This behavior is generated by a sophisticated genetic program that takes environmental input and produces relevant actions. Deutsch argues this does not involve creativity but rather a highly advanced program, the sophistication of which is beyond current human robotics [[evolutionary_biology_and_ai_parallels | evolutionary biology and AI parallels]]. The fact that the same program leads to the same effective behavior in different novel circumstances indicates it's programmed, not creatively derived in the moment.

### The Case of the Door-Opening Cat
A cat learning to open a door by jumping on the handle, perhaps by climbing a countertop in a novel way, might seem like conjecture and refutation. Deutsch suggests this is still compatible with the cat not being creative. The same sophisticated genetic programming that allows it to, for instance, navigate branches in undergrowth (an ancestral environment requiring complex problem-solving) could function in this new domestic environment.

### The Uniqueness of Human Storytelling
Humans, by contrast, engage in creative activities like telling stories, which is a different kind of activity than animals enacting complex behavioral "stories". Telling a story is a typical creative activity, akin to forming an explanation.

## Narrow AI and the Locus of Value

### The Role of Human Ideas in AI Success
When considering narrow AI (non-AGI) designed for specific tasks, like making a trillion dollars on the stock market, Deutsch emphasizes that the power or value often comes from the human idea behind the AI, not the AI itself [[ai_alignment_and_safety_concerns | AI alignment and safety concerns]]. Inventing a better paperclip could make one a fortune; the value is in the idea. Similarly, an arbitrage machine that makes a fortune does so because of the human's ingenious idea for how to search for arbitrage opportunities, not because the machine itself is intelligent in a general sense.

### Limitations of Non-AGI in Creative Economic Value
Even with advanced neural networks like AlphaZero that can "figure out" strategies in games like Go, Deutsch believes this model doesn't fully apply to the economy. Much of the value in the economy is created by the *creation of new knowledge* and creative ideas (e.g., the concept of a smartphone), which cannot be anticipated by anything less than an AGI [[alphazero_and_efficient_search_techniques | AlphaZero and efficient search techniques]]. 

## Consciousness and Knowledge

### The Nature of Conscious Experience (Critique of "Cartesian Theater")
Regarding the idea that thoughts and senses are "intrusions into consciousness" (a view sometimes expressed by meditators), and whether a VR generator could place thoughts as well as sense data into the mind, Deutsch agrees it's possible but critiques the underlying model of consciousness [[philosophical_perspectives_on_consciousness_and_free_will | philosophical perspectives on consciousness and free will]]. He likens it to Dennett's "Cartesian theater". The idea of "pure consciousness without content" is, in his view, still a consciousness *of* something – the imagined empty stage or space itself, which has content.

### Types of Knowledge (related to the "Fun Criterion")
Deutsch describes various kinds of knowledge present in human minds:
*   **Explicit knowledge:** Written down, like instructions in an exercise book.
*   **Inexplicit knowledge:** Such as our knowledge of grammar, where we know why sentences are acceptable or not but often can't state the rules explicitly.
*   **Knowledge in genes/biology:** Biologically ingrained information.
*   **Conscious and unconscious knowledge:** Both are forms of programs or ideas in the brain [[human_and_ai_intelligence_comparison | human and AI intelligence comparison]].
All these types of knowledge are information with causal power, containing both truth and error, and none should be shielded from criticism or replacement.

## Computational Principles and Limits

### The Turing Principle (Church-Turing-Deutsch Principle)

#### Simulating Physical Processes
The Turing Principle (also referred to as the Church-Turing-Deutsch principle) states that any universal computer can simulate any physical process.

#### Cosmological Constraints vs. Inherent Limits
However, this doesn't mean a computer smaller than the universe could simulate the *whole* universe. Such a task would exceed available memory or time, even with extremely dense information encoding hypothesized by theories like quantum gravity [[adscft_correspondence_and_holographic_principle | AdS/CFT correspondence and holographic principle]]. The universality of physical laws implies the rest of the universe would also be complex. It's significant to separate limitations due to available time and memory from limitations in fundamental computational capacity; this distinction is key to understanding computational universality. Even if cosmological factors impose an ultimate finite limit on computation within our universe, this is different from an inherent inability of computation itself. It would still be "up to us" what ideas fill that finite computational capacity.
  
### The Solubility of Problems

#### Challenging Claims of Intrinsic Unsolvability
Deutsch holds the philosophical view that all interesting problems are soluble, though this cannot be proven wrong by experiment. He argues that claims of intrinsic unsolvability for specific problems (e.g., the nature of consciousness, why there is something rather than nothing) are generally bad explanations. To assert something is impossible requires a functional explanation for *why* it is impossible, similar to how undecidability is proven for certain mathematical propositions. If the laws of physics included an undecidable function, we could still represent it (e.g., as f(x)) and understand its properties, even if we couldn't evaluate it for all inputs; this would not prevent understanding the physical world [[limits_and_potential_of_human_and_ai_knowledge | limits and potential of human and AI knowledge]].

## The Dynamics of Knowledge Growth

### Explaining Perceived Slowdowns in Scientific Progress
Regarding an apparent slowdown in research productivity and economic growth over the last 50 years, Deutsch attributes this not to a "low-hanging fruit" model of knowledge discovery, but to sociological factors within academic life that have "stultified the culture" in many, though not all, sectors. He cites a stultification in theoretical physics starting around the 1920s as an example, suggesting quantum computers might have been invented decades earlier without it. These declines are seen as parochial effects of specific, correctable mistakes, not an inherent limit to knowledge creation.

### The Epistemic Status of Theories and Popperianism
When a theory like Many-Worlds, already considered the best explanation for quantum mechanics, receives further strong evidential support (e.g., from a hypothetical AGI-quantum computer experiment), its epistemic status changes. In Popperian terms, rather than "increased credence," Deutsch suggests the new evidence provides a more powerful "repertoire of arguments". This new experimental outcome could refute alternative explanations, even unformulated ones, and specifically counter arguments based on flawed methodologies like naive empiricism, by refuting them even on their own terms.

## AGI Evolution and Suffering
Simulating the evolution of AGIs from non-people (NPCs) to personhood could entail suffering [[ai_alignment_and_existential_risks | AI alignment and existential risks]]. Deutsch theorizes that the hardware for explanatory creativity might have initially evolved for transmitting memes. During a transitional phase, entities might have used genuine creativity to transmit memes but lacked sufficient resources for this creativity to be applied more broadly or to alleviate their own condition. This period of "creatively transmitting blind memes" could have been very unpleasant, with suffering occurring even before full, reflective personhood emerged, because genuine creativity was being used, albeit not to good effect for the individual.

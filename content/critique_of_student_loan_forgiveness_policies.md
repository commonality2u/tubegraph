Economist Bryan Kaplan, in a podcast discussion, offered a sharp critique of student loan forgiveness policies. He expressed strong disapproval, stating it's challenging to find economists, regardless of their political leaning, who would defend such policies [00:59:10]-[00:59:18].

## Core Arguments Against Forgiveness

Kaplan outlined several key reasons for his opposition:

### 1. Regressive Nature
The policy is described as a "regressive transfer" [00:59:20]. Kaplan suggests that support from progressives might stem from a desire to benefit individuals with higher education who are perceived as part of their "team" [00:59:28]-[00:59:35]. He argues that forgiveness transfers the debt cost from "the elites that actually ran up the bill to the general population" [00:59:42]-[00:59:48], which includes many who did not attend college or receive its associated benefits [00:59:53]-[00:59:57].

### 2. Inefficiency and Negative Incentives
Kaplan contends that loan forgiveness does not inherently increase the amount of education, as the education has already been received [01:00:04]-[01:00:11]. The primary way it might increase education is by creating an expectation of future forgiveness, encouraging individuals to "rack up more debt" [01:00:15]-[01:00:18]. This increased willingness to borrow, he notes, could further inflate college tuition, for which he states there is "good evidence" [01:00:27]-[01:00:34].

### 3. Broader Critique of Education's Value
Kaplan's stance is informed by his more extreme view, detailed in his book "The Case Against Education" [01:00:45], that society has "way too much of it [education], most of it is very socially wasteful" [01:00:56]-[01:01:00]. From this perspective, student loan forgiveness is seen as a transfer to individuals who have "wasted a lot of social resources" [01:01:03]-[01:01:07].

#### Credential Inflation
A central concept to his critique of education is "credential inflation" [01:01:51]. He argues that "when everyone has a college degree nobody does" [01:01:53]-[01:01:55], drawing an analogy to how printing more money doesn't make a country richer but rather raises prices and causes harm [01:01:59]-[01:02:08].

### 4. Slippery Slope to "Free College for All"
Kaplan acknowledges that one potential argument in favor of loan forgiveness is that it moves society towards "free college for all" [01:01:12]-[01:01:15]. However, given his view that current levels of education are already excessive and wasteful, he sees this trajectory as detrimental [01:01:22]-[01:01:30].

## Conclusion
Bryan Kaplan's critique positions student loan forgiveness as an economically unsound policy that is regressive, creates perverse incentives, and exacerbates what he views as existing problems of over-education and credential inflation in society.

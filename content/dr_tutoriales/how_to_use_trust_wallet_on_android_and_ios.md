## Getting Started: Download and Setup

The first step is to download the Trust Wallet application to your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Creating or Importing a Wallet

Upon opening the app, you will have two options: [[creating_and_importing_wallets_on_trust_wallet | import an existing wallet]] or [[creating_and_importing_wallets_on_trust_wallet | create a new one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

*   **Creating a New Wallet**: If creating a new wallet, you must accept the privacy policy and set an access code (password) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The application will then prompt you to back up your wallet's security by revealing a 12-word secret phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. You must accept the conditions, which state that losing this phrase means losing access to your funds, and sharing it can lead to theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Trust Wallet is not responsible for lost funds if you lose your phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. After noting the phrase, you will need to re-enter the words in the correct order to verify your wallet creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Importing an Existing Wallet**: If you already have a wallet, you simply need to import the 12-word phrase in the correct order, then set your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Securing Your Secret Phrase

It is highly recommended to copy your 12-word secret phrase onto physical paper, rather than on your PC, as a PC is more vulnerable to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Navigating the Trust Wallet Interface

Once your wallet is successfully created, the main interface appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Main Wallet View

The main screen displays options for notifications and to view accepted cryptocurrencies within the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. You can also see "test" coins like BNB (Binance Coin) and Ethereum (ETH) on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrencies

The wallet offers options to send, receive, buy, and swap cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Receiving Cryptocurrencies**: To receive crypto (e.g., [[how_to_buy_bnb_on_binance_using_a_mobile_device | BNB]]), you can generate a QR code or an alphanumeric address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. It's crucial to ensure the correct blockchain is selected for the asset you are receiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Many different cryptocurrencies can be received in Trust Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Buying and Swapping Cryptocurrencies

*   **Swapping (Exchange)**: Trust Wallet allows you to swap or exchange cryptocurrencies, using the best market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Buying Cryptocurrencies**: You can purchase cryptocurrencies, such as [[how_to_buy_bnb_on_binance_using_a_mobile_device | BNB]], through third-party providers integrated into Trust Wallet, including Mercury, Transact, Balance Connect, and Simplex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This process typically involves opening a third-party page and making a card payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Discovering DApps and Staking Opportunities

The "Discover" section allows you to find decentralized applications (DApps) and staking opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. For example, you can find staking options for Polkadot with annualized interest rates up to 14.82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, or Solana <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. You can also explore options for loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### The DApp Browser

The built-in DApp browser allows you to view history and enter URLs for various sites, including those for swaps or information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is considered a more advanced feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

## Settings and Preferences

The "Configuration" or "Settings" section provides several customization options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Security and Wallets

*   You can configure security settings and change your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   In the "Wallets" section, you can view your main wallet and add new wallets to manage them all from the same device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### General Preferences

*   You can set the standard language and currency (e.g., USD) for the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   You can access the browser settings and clear the cache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   The app's appearance, such as dark mode, syncs with your mobile device's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

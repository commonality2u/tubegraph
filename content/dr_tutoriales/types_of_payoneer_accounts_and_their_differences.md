Payoneer offers a global payment platform designed for businesses and professionals to send and receive international payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The platform is accessible via computer and a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Account Types

There are two primary types of accounts available on Payoneer:
*   **Individual Account** (or private account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   **Company Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

### Key Differences and Transaction Rules

A crucial distinction between these account types lies in their transaction compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Company Accounts** on Payoneer generally cannot receive transfers from a personal bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Transfers to a Payoneer company account must originate from another company account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This ensures compatibility between the sender's and receiver's account types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Multi-Currency Management

Payoneer accounts support different currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros, and British Pounds Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Receiving Accounts**: When you set up a Payoneer account, specific receiving bank accounts are automatically opened for each supported currency (e.g., for the Eurozone, United Kingdom, and United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. These accounts are in your name and can be used to request payments from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **Requesting New Currencies**: Users can request additional receiving accounts in different currencies beyond the default ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. New accounts typically open with British Pound and US Dollar accounts by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Currency Conversion**: The platform allows users to convert funds from one currency to another, such as from Euros to Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Commissions apply to these conversions, and it's advisable to compare them with current exchange rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Commissions

Commissions vary depending on the type of transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While not considered excessively high, it's recommended to review the commission structure before executing transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

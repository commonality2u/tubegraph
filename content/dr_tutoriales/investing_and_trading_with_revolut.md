Revolut offers its users the ability to invest in various financial products, including stocks and cryptocurrencies, directly through its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

## Stock Investing

Revolut provides access to over 800 shares for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Users can start investing with as little as one dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

### Features for Stock Trading
*   **Market Graphs**: Users can view market graphs, including historical data over five years or one year, to analyze stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
*   **Financial Data**: Detailed financial information such as profit margins (annual and quarterly) is available for analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Activating Stock Trading
To enable buying and selling stocks, users must activate their security by registering their social security number (for English users) or ID/personal data (for Spanish users) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This is necessary for tracking and quantifying investment benefits, as governments maintain control over these products and receive notifications when money or gains are withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Trading

Revolut also allows users to buy and sell cryptocurrencies directly through the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

### Supported Cryptocurrencies
The platform offers a variety of cryptocurrencies, including Bitcoin (BTC), Cardano, Aptos, EOS, Ether, and Litecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

### Commissions and Plans
*   **Standard Plan**: For transactions with cryptocurrencies, the standard plan incurs an exchange fee of 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
*   **Upgraded Plans**: Users can reduce these commissions by upgrading their [[features_of_revoluts_platform | plan]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. For example, the Metal plan offers commission-free exchanges for investments, up to a certain monthly limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Savings and Rewards
While the standard account generally does not offer benefits for savings like annual rewards, higher-tier plans like Metal provide features that allow users to save money and receive an annual reward, such as 0.65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

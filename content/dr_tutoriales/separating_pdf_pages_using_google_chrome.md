## Method 1: Using Google Chrome's Print Function

This first methodology utilizes Google Chrome's built-in capabilities to [[using_pdf_tools_to_split_pdf_documents | separate PDF pages]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Opening the PDF in Chrome

1.  Locate the PDF file on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Right-click the PDF file and choose "Open with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
3.  Select "Google Chrome" from the list of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The PDF will open in a new tab in Google Chrome, displaying its pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

### Selecting Pages to Extract

1.  Click the "Printer" button, usually located in the top-right corner of the Chrome interface when viewing a PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
2.  In the print dialogue box, under the "Pages" setting, change the option from "All" to "Custom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  In the "Custom" field, enter the specific page numbers you wish to extract, separated by commas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. For example, to extract pages 3 and 4, type "3,4" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Saving the New PDF

1.  Click the "Print" button in the print dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  You will be prompted to choose a location on your computer to [[saving_and_managing_extracted_pdf_pages | store the new PDF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  Provide a name for the new file, such as "cropped PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

The newly created PDF will contain only the pages you specified (e.g., pages 3 and 4) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This method is straightforward and does not require any external programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

> Another method for [[using_pdf_tools_to_split_pdf_documents | splitting PDFs]] involves using online tools like iLovePDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This platform allows users to upload a PDF, select pages for extraction, and then download them, often as a compressed file like a WinRar archive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

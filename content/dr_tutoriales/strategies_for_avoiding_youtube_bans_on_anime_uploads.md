Uploading fragments of series, chapters, films, or [[uploading_anime_content_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | anime]] to YouTube without encountering bans or blocks requires specific editing [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | techniques]] to circumvent copyright detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. YouTube's algorithms can detect copyrighted content based on audio, music, voices, or images, leading to videos being blocked from public view or having monetization issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

While every content creator may have their own [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | strategies]] for uploading series chapters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:46">[01:44:46]</a>, the following methods have been found to work perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:51">[01:49:51]</a>.

## Editing Software
The video editing program Filmora 9 is used for applying these [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>.

## Key Editing [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | Techniques]]

### 1. Visual Modifications
Modifying the visual elements of the video is crucial to prevent YouTube from tracking the copyright through images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:15">[04:12:15]</a>.

*   **Channel Logo Integration**
    *   Always place your channel's logo throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:10">[02:08:10]</a>. This specific technique is used on a secondary channel dedicated to anime content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:15">[02:11:15]</a>.
    *   Ensure the logo and any accompanying text are visible throughout the duration of the video, from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:35">[02:29:35]</a>. This modification retouches the video's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:53">[02:49:53]</a>.
*   **Light Leak Effect**
    *   Apply a "light leak" effect, which is an effect available within the editing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:03">[03:00:03]</a>. This effect modifies the appearance, making it less dark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>.
*   **Borders**
    *   Add a border around the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:32">[03:30:32]</a>.
    *   Borders can be customized in color (e.g., blue below, white above) and can include a blurred effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:35">[03:32:35]</a>.
    *   The size of the video can also be edited within the border <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:57">[03:53:57]</a>.

### 2. Audio Modifications
Modifying the audio is also vital to prevent copyright detection through sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:22">[04:20:22]</a>.

*   **Volume Adjustment**
    *   When a video is imported into Filmora 9, it comes with a default sound volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>.
    *   The original video's volume should be set to zero or significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:40">[04:40:40]</a>.
    *   This prevents YouTube from registering audio peaks that could trigger copyright flags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:54">[04:54:54]</a>. Viewers can then adjust the volume on YouTube if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:52">[04:51:52]</a>.

## Uploading the Edited Video
After editing the video with the logo, frame, and sound adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:42">[05:40:42]</a>, the file can be uploaded via the "Create" and "Upload Videos" options on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:01">[05:52:01]</a>. With these [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | modifications]], the video should upload without restrictions and achieve [[video_visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | public visibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:14">[07:11:14]</a>.

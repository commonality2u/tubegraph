This guide explains how to [[how_to_cancel_or_delete_an_email_in_outlook | cancel or delete a sent email within Outlook]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prerequisite for Recall

The success of recalling or modifying a sent email in Outlook hinges on a crucial condition: the recipient **must not have opened the message** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the message has already been opened, the recall attempt will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Steps to Recall or Modify a Sent Email

1.  **Navigate to Sent Messages**: Go to your "Sent Messages" folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
2.  **Select the Email**: Locate and click on the specific email you wish to recall or modify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This action will open the email in a new window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Recall**: Click the "Recall This Message" button, typically found under the "Actions" or "Move" group on the ribbon (represented by a specific symbol) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Recall Options

Once you select "Recall This Message," you will be presented with two primary options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:

### 1. Delete Unread Copies of This Message

This option completely deletes the message so that it no longer appears in the recipient's mailbox, provided they haven't opened it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### 2. Delete Unread Copies and Replace with a New Message

This option allows you to delete the original message and send a modified version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For instance, if you forgot to add a farewell to your message, you can modify it and resend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Notification of Recall Success

For both options, you can choose to be alerted whether the recall or modification attempt was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. After making your selection and confirming, you will receive a confirmation that you "Tried to make the recall of This message" along with the date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A confirmation of this will arrive in your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

After [[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | creating a Google Form]] and receiving submissions, you can easily [[visualizing_and_analyzing_google_form_responses | view and analyze the collected responses]] directly within Google Forms or by exporting them to other formats like Google Sheets or CSV.

## Accessing Responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>

To view responses, navigate to your desired Google Form. Within the form editor, locate the "Responses" tab, which will also indicate the total number of responses received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Response Viewing Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

Google Forms provides three distinct ways to view responses:

### 1. Summary Tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

This tab offers an overview of all responses, providing visualizations for different question types. For example, multiple-choice questions display aggregated results, allowing you to quickly see trends and distribution of answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Many users prefer this summary view for its comprehensive overview of all responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### 2. Question Tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

Under the "Question" tab, you can view responses for each question individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This provides a different perspective, allowing you to focus on how specific questions were answered across all submissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### 3. Individual Tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

The "Individual" tab allows you to view each submission separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This is useful for reviewing a specific person's complete set of answers, such as exam results or detailed feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Managing Response Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

Within the "Responses" section, clicking on the three dots menu (â‹®) provides several options:

*   **[[receiving_email_notifications_for_google_form_responses | Receive email notifications]]**: Opt-in to get an email every time someone submits a response to your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Select response destination**: Choose where new responses will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Unlink form**: Disconnect the form from its current response destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Download responses (.csv)**: Export all responses into a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file, which can be opened in spreadsheet software like Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   **Open in Google Sheets**: Directly open the responses in a [[using_google_sheets_with_google_forms | Google Sheet]] for more advanced analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Exporting and Analyzing Responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

While the Google Forms interface provides a convenient way to view responses, for in-depth analysis, exporting the data is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Using Google Sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

[[using_google_sheets_with_google_forms | Google Sheets]] is seamlessly integrated with Google Forms. By clicking "View in Sheets" at the top of the responses section, your form responses will be organized in a spreadsheet format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This includes:

*   **Timestamp**: Showing the exact date, hour, and minute each response was submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Individual responses**: Each column represents a question from your form, and each row contains a complete submission from an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

From Google Sheets, you can further process the data, create charts, or perform complex calculations. You can also link this data to Excel for further analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

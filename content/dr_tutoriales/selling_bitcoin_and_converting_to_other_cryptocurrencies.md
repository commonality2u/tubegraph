## Converting Bitcoin

On the platform, you can convert Bitcoin to various assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Converting Bitcoin to Other Cryptocurrencies

It is generally recommended to [[strategic_buying_and_selling_in_cryptocurrency_markets | convert Bitcoin]] to other cryptocurrencies rather than directly to national currency to maximize profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This is because national currencies like the dollar or euro tend to devalue over time compared to cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Converting Bitcoin to National Currency

To convert Bitcoin to a national currency (e.g., Euro or Dollar), you would navigate to the relevant market pair, such as BTC/EUR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

1.  **Access the Market:** Find the market for Bitcoin against your desired national currency (e.g., BTC Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
2.  **Sell Bitcoin:** Select the "sell Bitcoin" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  **Enter Amount:** Choose the amount of Bitcoin you wish to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. You can enter a specific number or sell the total maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   There is a minimum order amount for selling Bitcoin to Euro, which is 10 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Sale:** Once the amount is defined, confirm the sale of Bitcoin, and the equivalent amount in your chosen national currency will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
5.  **Order Types:** You can place a "limit order" (specifying a price) or a "market order" (executing at the current market price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Converting Other Cryptocurrencies to National Currency

If you possess a cryptocurrency that cannot be directly converted to national currency (e.g., Volkswat cannot directly convert to euros), you will need to perform a two-step conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>:
1.  **First Conversion:** Convert the cryptocurrency to Bitcoin or another intermediate currency (e.g., dollar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
2.  **Second Conversion:** From Bitcoin, convert it to your desired national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Withdrawing to a Bank Account

Once your Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies have been converted to national currency, you can [[transferring_and_managing_cryptocurrency_assets | withdraw]] these funds to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Wallet:** Go to the "wallet" section and then select "spot wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
2.  **Select Withdraw:** Choose the "withdraw" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
3.  **Select Currency and Method:** Choose your national currency (e.g., Euro) and your preferred payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   **Bank Transfer:** This method often has lower commissions (e.g., 0.8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
        *   Minimum withdrawal amount is typically 3 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
        *   Maximum withdrawal for a single bank transfer can be up to 50,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
        *   Funds usually arrive in one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Bank Card:** This method might be faster (up to 30 minutes) but typically charges higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
        *   Minimum withdrawal is generally 10 euros, and the maximum is 5,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
4.  **Enter Details:** Input the desired withdrawal amount, your IBAN, and bank account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
5.  **Confirm:** Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Taxes:** When withdrawing benefits, it is necessary to declare profits and pay taxes in your country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
*   **Commissions:** Always consider the commissions charged by different withdrawal methods to save money, especially for larger quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Account Creation:** New users can often find referral links for discounts on commissions when creating an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
*   **Investing Cryptocurrencies:** To avoid simply holding cryptocurrencies, it is recommended to invest them to earn compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

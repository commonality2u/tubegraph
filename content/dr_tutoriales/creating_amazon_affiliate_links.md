## Prerequisites
To [[methods_for_obtaining_amazon_affiliate_links | obtain Amazon affiliate links]], an [[using_amazon_affiliate_account | Amazon affiliate account]] is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. If you do not have one, a video tutorial is available explaining how to [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | create an account within Amazon Affiliates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This process is straightforward and can be completed in about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

> [!INFO] API Code
> The API code, which allows the promotion of Amazon products without directly using affiliate links, generally requires at least three sales to be generated through the affiliate account before it becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Methods for Creating Affiliate Links

There are two primary [[methods_for_obtaining_amazon_affiliate_links | methods for obtaining Amazon affiliate links]]:

### Method 1: Using the Amazon Affiliates Platform
This method involves directly [[navigating_the_amazon_affiliates_platform | navigating the Amazon Affiliates platform]] to generate links for specific products.

1.  **Access Amazon Affiliates:** Open a browser and navigate to the Amazon Affiliates website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
2.  **Go to Product Links:** On the Amazon Affiliates screen, locate and click on the "Product Links" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Then, select the first option, which is "Product Links" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  **Search for a Product:** Use the search engine provided under "Search any product" to find the desired item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, searching for "Call of Duty PlayStation 4" will display all related products available on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The platform will show the number of search results found, e.g., 845 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  **Obtain the Link:**
    *   **Long Link:** Next to the product you wish to promote, click on the small arrow icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This will provide a long affiliate link that can be copied and pasted to promote the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **Short Link:** To get a more visually appealing and shorter link, click the arrow icon again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A question will appear asking if you want to shorten the URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Confirming this will provide a shorter Amazon Affiliates link that can be easily copied and used on websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Method 2: Using the Amazon Associates SiteStripe (Web Bar)
This method leverages a utility bar present on the main Amazon website for affiliate accounts.

1.  **Access the Main Amazon Page:** Go to the official Amazon website where all products are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
2.  **Locate the Web Bar:** At the top of the page, you will find a "Amazon Web Bar Affiliates" utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This bar is only visible to users with registered Amazon Affiliates accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
3.  **Search for a Product:** Use the main Amazon search bar to find any product you wish to promote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
4.  **Generate the Link from the Web Bar:** Once on a product page, the Amazon Affiliate Web Bar at the top left will offer options to get the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
    *   **Text Format:** Click on "Get Link" and select "Text" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This option allows you to choose an [[using_keywords_and_tracking_ids_for_amazon_affiliate_marketing | affiliate tracking ID]] and decide between a short or full link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
    *   **Text + Image Format:** Choosing "Text + Image" provides a different link option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. When clicked, this link can open in a new tab, which helps prevent users from losing their position on your website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

Once the link is copied, it can be placed on your website or other platforms where you are [[generating_revenue_through_amazon_affiliate_program | promoting Amazon products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Some users integrate these links with WordPress plugins to simplify advertising Amazon products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

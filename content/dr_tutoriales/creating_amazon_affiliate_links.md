To earn a commission from sales, Amazon affiliate links can be obtained through your Amazon Affiliates account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The process of [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | creating an Amazon Affiliates account]] is simple, typically taking about five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Once registered, you can generate links to sell Amazon products and earn a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Method 1: Using the Product Links Tab

One way to obtain affiliate links is through the "Product Links" tab on the Amazon Affiliates screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

1.  **Access Product Links**: Navigate to the "Product Links" tab and select the first option, also called "Product Links" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  **Search for Products**: A search engine allows you to find any product available on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, searching for "Call of Duty Playstation 4" will display relevant results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Generate Link**: Once you've found the desired product, click the arrow next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This will provide a long affiliate link that can be copied and pasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
4.  **[[shortening_amazon_links_for_better_usage | Shorten the Link]]**: If the long link is too cumbersome, you can click the arrow again and choose to "shorten the URL with the name of the link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A shorter Amazon Affiliates link will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This shortened link can then be copied and placed on your website, potentially with an [[using_amazon_affiliate_plugins_to_make_money | Amazon affiliate plugin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Method 2: Using the Amazon Web Bar

Another highly intuitive method involves [[using_amazon_web_bar_for_affiliate_links | using the Amazon Web Bar]], which appears on the main Amazon website after you've registered with Amazon Affiliates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

1.  **Access Main Amazon Page**: Go to the official Amazon main page where all products are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
2.  **Locate Web Bar**: At the top of the page, you'll see a bar labeled "Amazon Web Bar Affiliates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This utility is exclusive to registered Amazon Affiliates accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
3.  **Generate Product Link**: Browse for any product on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Once on a product page, the Amazon Affiliate web bar in the top left provides options to get the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
4.  **Choose Link Format**:
    *   **Text Format**: Click on "Text format" to choose your affiliate ID for tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. You can select either a short link or a full (long) link based on your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   **Text Plus Image**: Selecting "Text plus image" provides a different link that, when clicked, opens the product page in a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This is useful as it keeps users on your website while directing them to the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

Both methods allow you to copy the generated link and embed it on your website or other platforms where you promote Amazon products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

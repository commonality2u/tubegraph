3.  **Choose Video Option**: Within the "Insert" tab, locate and click on the "Video" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
4.  **Select Online Video**: PowerPoint provides options to add an online video or a video from your PC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For online content, choose "Online Video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Online Videos

*   **Internet Connection**: It is crucial to remember that online videos embedded in PowerPoint require an active internet connection to play during the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If there is no Wi-Fi or internet access, the video will not play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

While this article focuses on online video insertion, it's helpful to understand the distinction between [[inserting_videos_from_a_computer_into_powerpoint | inserting videos from a computer into PowerPoint]] and online videos, which also relates to [[comparing_online_and_offline_video_insertion_in_powerpoint | Comparing online and offline video insertion in PowerPoint]]:

*   **Online Videos (e.g., YouTube)**: These require a continuous internet connection during playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Offline Videos (from PC)**: Videos inserted directly from your computer do not require an internet connection for viewing and can be played at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Knowing the playback requirements is essential to ensure a smooth presentation experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

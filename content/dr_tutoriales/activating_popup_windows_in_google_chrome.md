This guide explains how to activate and manage pop-up windows within [[google_chrome_privacy_and_security_settings | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This process is straightforward and can be customized for different sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Navigating to Chrome Settings

To begin, open the [[managing_search_engines_in_google_chrome | Google Chrome]] browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
1.  Locate the "Configuration" (settings) icon, typically found in the top right corner of the browser window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Click on "Configuration" to open the settings menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Accessing Advanced Settings

Once in the "Configuration" menu, click on "[[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | advanced settings]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This will display more detailed options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Locating Pop-up Settings

There are two primary ways to find the pop-up settings within [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | advanced settings]]:

### Method 1: Using the Search Bar
1.  In the "Search settings" bar, type "emerging" (or "pop-up") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  The "site configuration" section will appear, which includes pop-up settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### Method 2: Navigating through Privacy and Security
1.  From the left-hand menu, click on "[[google_chrome_privacy_and_security_settings | privacy and security]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
2.  Then, click on "site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  Scroll down to the "Permissions" section to find "Pop-ups and redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This option controls "windows emerging redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Enabling Popup Windows Globally

By default, Chrome is set to "not allow sites to send [[blocking_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | windows emerging]] or use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
To enable pop-ups for all sites:
1.  Click on the "Pop-ups and redirects" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  Toggle the setting to allow sites to "send windows pop-ups and use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Blocking Specific Sites from Sending Pop-ups

Even when pop-ups are generally enabled, you can still [[specific_site_popup_window_blocking | block specific sites]] from sending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
1.  Within the "Pop-ups and redirects" settings, look for the "Block" section.
2.  Click "Add" next to the "Block" list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  Enter the URL of the site you wish to block (e.g., `www.youtube.com`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
4.  Click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The site will no longer send you pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

This allows for granular control, letting you activate pop-ups generally while [[specific_site_popup_window_blocking | discretizing specific pages]] that you don't want to send them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

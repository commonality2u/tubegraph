On cryptocurrency exchanges, users can utilize "savings" products, both flexible and locked, to generate profitability from their existing cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The profitability offered by these savings options can influence decisions regarding which cryptocurrencies to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Accessing Savings Products
Savings products are typically found within the "finance" section of the exchange platform, which compiles various programs designed to help users generate profitability from their cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This section often includes options like flexible terms, fixed terms, and higher-risk products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Types of Savings
The two primary types of savings discussed are [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] and locked savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These options allow users (creditors) to provide a cryptocurrency and receive an annual profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Flexible Savings
[[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible savings]] allow users to deposit and withdraw their cryptocurrency at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The interest rate received for [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] is generally more or less fixed, though it can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. While the returns are typically lower compared to locked savings, the main advantage is the ability to withdraw capital whenever desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Locked Savings
Locked savings, as the name suggests, require users to deposit a cryptocurrency for a predetermined number of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Common durations include 7, 14, 30, or 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The capital deposited in locked savings cannot be withdrawn until the specified period ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Interest Rates and Profitability
The interest rate and profitability vary significantly between [[comparing_flexible_and_locked_savings | flexible and locked savings]].

*   **Higher Rates for Longer Durations:** For locked savings, the interest rate (profitability) increases with the duration of the deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The longer the cryptocurrency is locked, the greater the profitability earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This is because providing an asset for a longer period offers greater confidence to the platform, allowing it to generate profitability through commissions or liquidity provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **Fixed vs. Variable Rates:** [[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible savings]] offer a more stable, though potentially variable, interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, whereas locked savings provide higher, duration-dependent rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### When to Use Each Type
It is recommended to use locked savings when the deposited money is not immediately needed or when a very long-term investment is certain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. For example, if there is no intention to sell a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin in the long term, locking it could be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Profitability and Risk
Before depositing cryptocurrencies into locked savings, it's crucial to consider the current market period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. If the cryptocurrency is nearing a correction stage, locking it for an extended period should be carefully thought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. While savings products are generally not considered high-risk, a significant risk is currency devaluation during the lock-up period, as capital cannot be withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. In [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]], this risk is mitigated by the ability to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

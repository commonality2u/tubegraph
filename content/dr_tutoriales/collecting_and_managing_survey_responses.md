Google Forms offers various features for collecting and managing survey responses. While the primary focus during creation is on the questions, understanding how responses are handled is crucial for effective data collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Accessing Responses
After [[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | creating a survey]] in Google Forms, you can view the responses directly within the forms interface. To do this, navigate to the right side of the form where you'll find a section dedicated to "Answers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Initially, if the survey has just been created, there will be no responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Response Configuration Options
Google Forms provides several settings to configure how responses are collected and managed. These settings are accessible under the "Configuration" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>:

### Converting to a Quiz
While primarily for tests, you can convert a survey into a questionnaire. This allows for features such as assigning scores, defining correct answers, and providing automatic feedback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This function is typically used for educational assessments rather than standard surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Collecting Email Addresses
You have the option to collect the email addresses of individuals who fill out the survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This can be useful if you need to verify results or link responses to specific individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Sending Response Copies
You can choose to send respondents copies of their replies after they submit the survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. To use this feature, the setting to collect email addresses must be enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### Allowing Response Modification
Google Forms allows you to enable or disable the option for respondents to modify their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For many surveys, it is preferable to prevent modification once an answer has been submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Limiting Responses
You can limit how many times a single person can answer the survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. By default, there might not be a limit, allowing individuals to fill out the survey multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. However, for formal or research-oriented surveys, it is often necessary to restrict each person to only one response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Default Form Settings
You can save various form settings as defaults for future surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This can streamline the creation process for subsequent forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Viewing and Analyzing Responses
After collecting responses, you can view them simply within Google Forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. For more advanced [[visualizing_and_analyzing_google_form_responses | visualization and analysis of the results]], separate tutorials might cover how the results are presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

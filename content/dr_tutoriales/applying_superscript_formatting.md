This article provides a tutorial on how to apply superscript formatting, also known as superindices, in Excel documents to enhance the presentation of numbers and units, particularly in graphs or values that require them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Applying Superscript to Cell Text

To apply a superscript to specific characters within a cell in Excel:
1.  Open your Excel document containing the text or values you wish to format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Select the specific number or character you want to turn into a superscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. For example, if you have "m3", select only the "3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  Right-click on the selected character(s) and choose "Format Cells..." from the context menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Alternatively, you can click the small arrow icon in the "Font" group on the Home tab to open the Format Cells dialog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  In the "Format Cells" dialog box, navigate to the "Font" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
5.  Under the "Effects" section, check the "Superscript" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This option is labeled "superíndice" in Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
6.  Click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Once applied, the selected number will appear as a superscript within the cell, even though it may appear on the normal line in the formula bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. For instance, "m3" will display as "m³" in the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Applying Superscript to Graph Labels

This formatting technique is also applicable to labels within [[excel_graph_formatting | Excel graphs]], such as units on axes or data labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For example, in a density graph where units like "kg/m3" are used, you can format the "3" as a superscript:
1.  Select the text box or the specific part of the label within the graph that contains the character to be formatted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
2.  Similar to cell text, select the number or character you want to elevate (e.g., the "3" in "kg/m3") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
3.  Right-click on the selection or use the "Format Cells" dialog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
4.  Check the "Superscript" box and click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The number will then appear correctly as a superscript within the graph label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Contacting [[how_to_contact_facebook_support | Facebook support]] can be a complex process, but by following specific steps, users can provide the necessary information to get assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Accessing Support

The primary way to reach support is through the [[using_facebook_business_help_service | Facebook Business Help Service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While the general [[how_to_contact_facebook_support | Facebook Help]] section often leads to FAQs, the business help service allows direct contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. If you haven't created a business account, you can quickly do so using your existing Facebook profile without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Navigating the Business Help Service

Once in the business help section, avoid selecting specific options from the main list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Instead, navigate to the "First steps" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Here, look for "Get in Service" or "service contact of attendance," which leads to the "Help Account Overview for businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This area displays recent and resolved account problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. To initiate contact, select "If I need help, we're going to have to give it to contact the service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Providing Problem Details to Initiate a Chat

When prompted to state your problem, choose "I think someone has accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. It's important to select this option even if your actual problem is unrelated, as it helps bypass filters that might redirect you to other websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. You can explain the true nature of your problem later to the support representative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Date of suspicious time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Confirmation of whether **suspicious user activity** was detected (Yes/No) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   Confirmation of whether **suspicious advertising account activity** was detected (Yes/No) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>

This article outlines different strategies for depositing money into [[how_to_deposit_money_into_binance | Binance]] while aiming to minimize transaction commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. By paying fewer commissions, users retain more capital to [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | invest in cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Direct Deposits on Binance

Binance offers two primary ways to deposit funds: fiat currency and cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Fiat Deposits
Fiat deposits involve national currencies like Euro, Dollar, or Pound Sterling, provided they are accepted by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The available [[binance_commission_structure | methods to reduce Binance commissions]] and their associated fees can vary depending on the currency chosen and the current market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Common methods include:
*   **Visa/MC Bank Card**: May incur a commission, such as 1.8% for Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> or 18% for Pound Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **P2P Bank Transfer**: Can have 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Wallet Make Cash**: May have 0% commission but potentially additional fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **SEPA Transfer / Quick Payments**: These methods have sometimes been suspended for certain countries in the European community due to regulatory analyses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **SWIFT Bank Transfer**: For currencies like the US Dollar, a SWIFT transfer might have 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

It is important to note that fees and available [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | depositing fiat and cryptocurrencies on Binance]] methods are dynamic and can change based on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Deposits
[[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Depositing cryptocurrencies]] on Binance also incurs costs, which depend on the blockchain network used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The goal is to choose a cryptocurrency whose network has lower transaction costs for sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Alternative Methods to Reduce Deposit Fees

When direct fiat deposit fees on Binance are considered too high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, an alternative approach involves using other platforms with lower fiat deposit fees and then transferring cryptocurrency to Binance.

### Strategy Outline:
1.  **Deposit Fiat on Another Platform**: Choose an exchange (e.g., Kraken, KuCoin, Coinbase) that allows fiat deposits with minimal or zero cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
    *   For example, Kraken might allow a SEPA deposit of Euros with 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. These deposits typically take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   Coinbase, for instance, might charge approximately 0.50-0.75 Euros for SEPA transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
2.  **Convert Fiat to Low-Cost Cryptocurrency**: Once fiat is deposited, convert it into a cryptocurrency known for low transaction costs when transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Examples include Tron (TRX) or Litecoin (LTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   The conversion from fiat to crypto typically has a commission, e.g., around 0.16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For 2,000 Euros, this could be about 3.2 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
    *   KuCoin may offer lower trading commissions for conversion, around 0.1% for certain user levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
3.  **Transfer Cryptocurrency to Binance**: Transfer the chosen low-cost cryptocurrency from the initial platform to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Each platform has its own withdrawal fees for cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   For example, sending Tron (TRX) from Kraken to Binance could cost as low as 10 cents of a dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Cost Example (Kraken to Binance via Tron):
*   Fiat deposit on Kraken: 0 Euros (for SEPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   Conversion from Euros to Tron: Approximately 0.16% (e.g., 3.2 Euros for 2,000 Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   Transfer Tron from Kraken to Binance: Approximately 0.10 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Total estimated cost for a 2,000 Euro deposit: Around 3.3 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

This method often results in a significantly lower total commission cost compared to direct bank card deposits on Binance with high percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## General Recommendations
*   Always check the specific [[binance_commission_structure | commission structure]] and withdrawal fees on various platforms before initiating a transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   Prioritize cryptocurrencies like Litecoin (LTC) or Tron (TRX) for transfers, as they typically have lower network fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   Consider using a referral link when creating a Binance account, as it can offer a 10% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, which is part of [[using_referrals_and_discounts_on_binance | using discounts on Binance to save on transaction fees]].

By carefully evaluating the [[methods_to_reduce_binance_commissions | methods to reduce Binance commissions]] and using alternative platforms, users can significantly reduce their deposit fees and maximize their investment capital.

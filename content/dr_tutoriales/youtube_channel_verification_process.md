Learning how to verify a YouTube channel involves understanding different types of verification and the features they unlock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Types of YouTube Channel Verification

There are generally two types of channel verification:

### The Verified Badge (Checkmark)
To obtain the verified checkmark badge on a channel, it is necessary to have 100,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This specific verification confirms the authenticity of a channel for creators with larger audiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Enabling Channel Features
Beyond the verified badge, there is another form of [[YouTube account verification | account verification]] that enables essential channel features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many functions are not enabled if a channel has not been verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Key features that require verification include:
*   **Video Uploads**: The ability to upload videos longer than fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Custom Thumbnails**: The option to use custom thumbnails for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Live Broadcasts**: The capability to conduct live streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Advanced Features**: More video uploads per day, more live streams per day, and the ability to create Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **Monetization**: Verification is needed to apply for monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Verification Methods for Features
To enable these features, a channel may require different forms of verification:
*   **[[Phone number verification for YouTube | Phone Number Verification]]**: Necessary for uploading longer videos, custom thumbnails, and live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Identity Document**: For advanced features like increased daily uploads and live streams, a valid identity document may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Channel History or Video Verification**: These methods can also be used for certain advanced feature activations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

[[P2P trading method on Binance | P2P payments]], also known as person-to-person (P2P) or peer-to-peer, are defined as a [[currency_exchange_using_p2p | currency exchange]] between different types of coins and users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method can often be more profitable than exchanging within a traditional bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. When conducting [[P2P trading method on Binance | P2P transactions]], it is important to consider price and commission graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Accessing P2P Trading on Binance

To begin [[P2P trading method on Binance | P2P trading]] on Binance, navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section and select "P2P Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This section allows users to both buy and sell cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. The exchange takes place between different users, and prices are set by individual offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Key Considerations for P2P Transactions

### How to Set Prices for Buying and Selling

When selling, users [[how_to_set_prices_for_buying_and_selling_in_p2p | set a price]] for the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. When buying, users accept the price set by another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Users can choose the fiat currency they are working with, such as Euros, and specify the amount they wish to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin can be selected for exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Offers from other users are limited by specific amounts, for example, 200 to 380 Euros for a Bitcoin purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

It is crucial to compare the proposed exchange price with the current market price of the cryptocurrency to ensure profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. For instance, if a Bitcoin is offered at 28,000 Euros through P2P, but the market price is 27,663 Euros, it may not be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Cryptocurrency prices, like Bitcoin, are highly volatile and can change rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Choosing Payment Methods

[[Choosing payment methods for cryptocurrency transactions | The payment method]] is another important factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Users can filter offers based on preferred payment options, as not all users accept every method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Common methods include bank transfers and [[benefits_of_using_paypal_for_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Importance of User Ratings

The [[importance_of_user_ratings_in_p2p_transactions | rating of each user]] is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This rating indicates the number of [[P2P trading method on Binance | P2P transactions]] completed and the percentage of successful completions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. After a transaction, users can rate the other party based on speed, ease, and correct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Transactions carry a risk that payment may not be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Users should examine the number of orders a user has completed and their completion percentage before engaging in a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Performing a P2P Transaction

### Transferring Funds to P2P Wallet

Before conducting a [[P2P trading method on Binance | P2P trade]], capital must be transferred to the P2P wallet. This is done from the fiat and spot wallet to the P2P balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. For example, to sell Bitcoin, transfer the desired amount from your spot wallet to your P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Once the transfer is confirmed, the cryptocurrencies will appear in the P2P wallet, allowing them to be traded on the P2P commerce platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Executing a Trade

When initiating a buy or sell order, a pop-up window will appear showing the maximum and minimum amounts that can be traded with a specific seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The seller specifies the payment method, such as bank transfer, and the payment limit time for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Users must complete the transfer within the given timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

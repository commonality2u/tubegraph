This article provides a tutorial on using Payoneer's platform to manage currencies and transactions, covering account types, payment options, and currency exchange functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tutorial is demonstrated on a computer, but a mobile app is also available with similar functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

## Payoneer Account Basics

Upon logging in, users are presented with an interactive menu on the left side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. This menu provides access to various sections, including:
*   Home/Beginning part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>
*   Receiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>
*   Paying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>
*   Withdrawing and transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:08">[01:16:08]</a>
*   Account activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>
*   Banks & Cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>
*   Business network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:04">[01:19:04]</a>

Users can also access notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:09">[01:40:09]</a>, customer support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:10">[01:43:10]</a> (available in multiple languages including Spanish and English across various regions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:15">[01:49:15]</a>, and configure their profile (name, verification, logout) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:09">[02:03:09]</a>. Each user has a unique ID number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>.

### Account Types
Payoneer offers two types of [[different_types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_uses | Payoneer accounts]]:
1.  **Individual (Private) Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:02">[02:24:02]</a>
2.  **Company (Business) Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:02">[02:28:02]</a>

It's crucial to understand that direct transfers from an individual bank account to a business [[different_types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_uses | Payoneer account]] are generally not permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Transfers to a business [[different_types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_uses | Payoneer account]] must originate from another company account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:04">[03:03:04]</a>.

## Managing Currencies

Payoneer supports multiple currencies within its platform, including dollars, euros, and British pounds sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:16">[03:26:16]</a>.

### Receiving Accounts
Under the "Banks & Cards" section, users can find their "receiving accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:15">[03:39:15]</a>. For each supported currency, Payoneer automatically opens a dedicated bank account (e.g., for the Eurozone, United Kingdom, and United States) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:07">[03:53:07]</a>. Users can view and copy the bank details for these accounts to receive payments from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:04">[04:01:04]</a>.

### Requesting New Currencies
If a user wishes to apply for an account in a different currency not automatically provided, they can click "request" and select their desired currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:04">[04:19:04]</a>. Specific currency requests can also be made by contacting support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:01">[04:27:01]</a>.

### Currency Exchange
Within the "Withdrawal and transfer" section, the "manage currencies" option allows users to convert funds from one currency to another (e.g., euros to dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:05">[06:29:05]</a>. Payoneer will provide a rate and associated commission for the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:07">[06:39:07]</a>.

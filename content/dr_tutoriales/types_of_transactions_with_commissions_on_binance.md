[[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | Understanding commissions and fees on Binance]] on the Binance Exchange is crucial for saving money and investing more in cryptocurrencies [00:00:27]. This guide covers five main types of transactions that involve commissions and how to [[reducing_binance_commissions | reduce them]].

## Deposits

Deposits on Binance can be made using either fiat currency or cryptocurrencies [00:01:37].

### Fiat Deposits

When depositing national currencies like Euro, Dollar, or Rubles, various methods are available:
*   **Bank Transfer**: This is the recommended method for lower commissions [00:02:04]. However, post-Brexit, transfers from Europe to the UK (where Binance is located) may incur bank commissions [00:02:39].
    *   **Recommendation**: Using a digital bank like Bank N26 can help achieve zero commission transfers to countries outside the European Union, including the UK [00:03:07]. Funds usually arrive within one or two business days [00:03:28].
*   **Banking Card** [00:01:54]
*   **iDeal** [00:01:55]
*   **Wallets** (e.g., Tana's wallet) [00:01:55]

### Cryptocurrency Deposits

Depositing cryptocurrencies from another account (e.g., Coinbase) does not incur any commission from Binance upon entry [00:04:25]. The commissions, if any, are charged by the platform from which the cryptocurrency is being emitted [00:04:06].

## Internal Transfers

Transfers made between different wallets within the same Binance account (e.g., from a spot wallet to a futures wallet for leveraged trading) are free of commission [00:05:06]. This applies to internal transfers within your account [00:05:21].

## Trading Operations (Buying/Selling Cryptocurrencies)

### Commission Levels (VIP Levels)

Binance uses a VIP level system, where commission rates depend on your trading volume (in Bitcoin or futures) and your BNB balance [00:05:31], [00:05:55]. Higher VIP levels (e.g., VIP one, VIP two) result in lower commission rates [00:06:25]. For example, VIP zero pays 0.1% commissions, while VIP one pays 0.09% [00:08:28]. The maximum level, VIP nine, requires significant Bitcoin or BNB holdings [00:08:34].

### Reducing Commissions with BNB

A key way to [[reducing_binance_commissions | reduce Binance commissions]] is by using BNB (Binance Coin) to pay for them [00:06:47]. Activating this option provides a 25% discount on commissions [00:06:56]. This means instead of paying 0.1%, you pay 0.075% [00:07:32]. To utilize this, you must have BNB available in your spot wallet (not in locked savings) [00:07:23].

### Referral Link Discounts

New users can receive a 10% discount on commissions by using a referral link when creating an account [00:02:15].

## Binance Visa Card Usage

The Binance Visa card offers a refund (cashback) on payments made with the card, which depends on the amount of BNB you hold [00:09:49]. For instance, holding 10 BNB can yield a 2% refund on payments [00:09:58].

## Withdrawals

Withdrawals from Binance, whether fiat or cryptocurrency, typically involve commissions [00:10:35].

### Fiat Withdrawals

For withdrawing fiat money, options include:
*   **Bank Transfer**: Similar to deposits, using a bank like Bank N26 is recommended to avoid commissions when transferring money to non-UK European banks, as Binance's transfers originate from the UK [00:10:57].
*   **Card or Visa Card**: A fee of 0.8% commission on euros for bank transfer [00:10:47].

### Cryptocurrency Withdrawals

When transferring cryptocurrencies to another account or a cold wallet, commissions are charged based on the network used for the transfer [00:12:35]. For example, a Bitcoin transfer might cost an amount equivalent to 30 cents, while a BNB chain transfer costs 0.07 [00:12:47]. These commissions are generally not reducible through internal settings, though a referral link might offer some reduction [00:12:56]. Each cryptocurrency also has a minimum withdrawal amount [00:13:11].

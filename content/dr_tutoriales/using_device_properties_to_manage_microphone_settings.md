Managing microphone settings on a computer or laptop, particularly to increase volume, is essential for clear communication during streaming or recording [00:00:03]. This process can facilitate subsequent editing and ensure listeners hear with perfect clarity [00:00:12].

## Adjusting Microphone Volume via Sound Settings

To increase the volume of a microphone on a Windows computer:

1.  Navigate to the Start taskbar [00:00:37].
2.  Type "sound" in the search bar [00:00:42].
3.  Select "sound settings" [00:00:46].
4.  Within the sound settings, go to the "entrance" (input) section, not the "exit" (output/speakers) section [00:00:49].
5.  Select the desired microphone for which you want to increase the volume [00:01:08]. The speaker demonstrates with "Phono Filter," which is currently recording the video [00:00:58].
6.  Click on "properties of the device" [00:01:14].
7.  In the device properties window, the microphone volume will typically be at 100% [00:01:19]. This 100% represents the maximum volume the microphone can capture without reducing sound quality [00:01:22]. Increasing the volume beyond this point, if possible, would reduce the sound quality considerably [00:01:33]. Conversely, lowering it would keep it within the quality allowed by the microphone [00:01:37].
8.  For some [[how_to_increase_microphone_volume_on_windows_10 | Windows 10]] setups, a different window might appear where you would go to the "levels" section to adjust the microphone volume, which should be at 100% [00:01:55]. Apply changes if necessary [00:02:14].

## Enhancing Audio Volume with External Software

Another method to [[methods_to_enhance_audio_volume_during_recording | enhance audio volume during recording]] involves using dedicated software like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) or VSR (Video Screen Recorder) [00:02:22]. This program allows for recording videos at desired volumes, which can then be modified or converted to audio formats [00:02:34].

To adjust microphone volume within OBS/VSR:

1.  Locate the "microphones and auxiliaries" section [00:02:57].
2.  Go to "settings" and then "properties" [00:03:01].
3.  Choose the microphone you intend to use [00:03:04].
4.  Once the microphone is selected, navigate to the "audio mixer" window [00:03:12].
5.  Right-click and select "advanced audio properties" [00:03:17].
6.  This will display different microphones or audio sources interacting in the recording [00:03:24].
7.  Identify your recording microphone (e.g., "electro phone or computer") [00:03:37]. The standard volume is typically 0.0 decibels, which corresponds to the 100% setting found in the device properties [00:03:47].
8.  To increase the volume further, drag the volume slider [00:04:00]. This technique increases the volume but can slightly reduce the audio quality [00:04:06]. This trade-off between volume and quality should be kept in mind [00:04:13].

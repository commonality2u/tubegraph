Windows Defender is a built-in security feature on Windows computers that can sometimes block downloads, updates, and installations of certain products or programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Understanding how to manage its settings can be useful for these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Accessing Windows Defender Settings

To access [[how_to_deactivate_windows_defender_in_windows_10 | Windows Defender]] settings:
1.  Go to the Windows taskbar (bottom left) and type "defend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  Select the "Windows Security option in antivirus protection against threats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, [[how_to_activate_windows_defender | Windows Defender]] can also be accessed via the menu on the left side of the Windows Security interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Navigating Within Windows Security

Once in the Windows Security interface:
*   To see all available options for defending against external threats, navigate to the "home section" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   To [[how_to_activate_windows_defender | enable]] or [[how_to_deactivate_windows_defender_in_windows_10 | disable]] Windows Defender, select the "antivirus protection against threats" option, which is typically the first option on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   Other security systems, such as firewall and network protection, can be accessed through a different option, typically labeled "number three" on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## [[windows_defender_configuration_management | Windows Defender Configuration Management]]

Within the "antivirus protection against threats" section, you will find the option to "managing the configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### [[how_to_deactivate_windows_defender_in_windows_10 | Deactivating Windows Defender]]
If you wish to deactivate Windows Defender, for example, due to the [[importance_of_disabling_windows_defender_for_certain_downloads | importance of disabling Windows Defender for certain downloads]], you must:
1.  Change the blue bar from "on" to "deactivated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  A confirmation prompt will appear, which you must accept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

To fully deactivate, you will need to disable several protection components:
*   Real-time protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>
*   Cloud-based protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>
*   Automatic sample submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
*   Tamper protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>

Once these are deactivated, the antivirus protection status will show a red cross, indicating it is completely disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

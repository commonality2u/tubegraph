When [[transferring_and_managing_cryptocurrency_assets | transferring cryptocurrency]] and managing assets, ensuring the safety and successful completion of the transaction is paramount. This guide provides essential tips to help users navigate the process securely, whether converting crypto to fiat or moving assets between platforms.

## Verifying Counterparties in P2P Trading

When engaging in person-to-person (P2P) exchanges, such as on platforms like Binance, it's crucial to assess the reliability of the advertiser you are trading with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Checking Advertiser History
Always choose to trade with individuals who have a substantial history of completed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The completion percentage of their orders serves as a strong indicator of their trustworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. It is recommended to avoid trading with users whose completion rate falls below 95%, as this might indicate issues with past operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

One of the most critical aspects of [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | transferring cryptocurrency to a bank account]] or another wallet is ensuring the accuracy of the recipient address.

### Double-Checking Withdrawal Addresses
If an incorrect address is entered during a withdrawal, the cryptocurrency will be sent to the wrong blockchain address and cannot be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This is a common pitfall that can lead to permanent loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

### Performing Small Test Transfers
To mitigate the risk of losing capital due to an incorrect address, especially when [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms | transferring cryptocurrencies between platforms]] like Binance to Kraken, it is highly recommended to perform a small test transfer first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This allows you to verify that the process works correctly before committing a larger amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Once the small transfer is successful, you can proceed with the larger amount with confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Using QR Codes for Transfer Accuracy
When making transfers from a mobile device, using a [[using_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transfer | QR code for cryptocurrency transfer]] can help ensure the address is accurately copied, reducing the chance of manual errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## [[Transaction fees and network selection for cryptocurrency transfers | Transaction Fees and Network Selection]]

Understanding [[tips_on_avoiding_high_transaction_fees | transaction fees]] and [[choosing_appropriate_networks_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | choosing appropriate networks for cryptocurrency transactions]] is vital for cost-efficient and safe transfers.

### Considering Network Fees
Different blockchain networks have varying commission structures. For instance, an ERC-20 network commission might be 10 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It's important to review the commission rules for your chosen network, as fees can significantly impact the final amount received, especially for smaller transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Optimizing Transfer Amounts for Fees
Network fees are often fixed regardless of the transfer amount. For example, if a fixed fee is 10 USDT, transferring 20 USDT means half your amount goes to fees, but transferring 300 USDT or 4000 USDT would still incur the same 10 USDT fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Therefore, it's generally recommended to transfer larger quantities to minimize the impact of fixed fees, after confirming the process with a small test transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

When engaging in [[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P transactions]], understanding and utilizing user ratings is crucial for a secure and successful experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These ratings provide vital insights into the reliability of other users, helping mitigate risks and ensure smooth exchanges.

## What Are User Ratings?

User ratings reflect the history and success rate of a user's [[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. They indicate:
*   The total number of [[P2P trading method on Binance | P2P transactions]] a user has completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   The percentage of those transactions that were carried out satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## Why User Ratings Are Important

Checking user ratings is paramount because it allows you to assess the trustworthiness of the person you're trading with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. When a [[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P transaction]] is finished, users can rate each other based on:
*   **Speed**: How quickly the transaction was completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Ease**: The simplicity and smoothness of the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Correct Payment**: Whether the payment was received correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

A critical aspect of [[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P transactions]] is the risk that a payment might not be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This is a risk each individual assumes when participating in these payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. High ratings, especially a high percentage of completed orders, help to mitigate this risk, indicating a reliable counterparty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## How to Check User Ratings

User ratings are typically displayed beneath each user's name on the trading platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. For example, a user might have "52 orders and 96.30% completed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It's important to note that a small percentage of uncompleted orders doesn't necessarily mean dishonesty; it could be due to recent transactions that haven't been finalized yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

When performing a transaction, it is essential to consider both the total number of orders a user has made and the percentage of orders they have successfully completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This information, alongside checking the price graphs for the [[currency_exchange_using_p2p | currency exchange]], is vital for informed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

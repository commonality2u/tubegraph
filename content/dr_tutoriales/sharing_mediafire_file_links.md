MediaFire also allows you to upload entire folders, which is useful for uploading multiple files at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28">[03:28]</a>. This option is available via the "Upload" menu as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>.

## Sharing MediaFire Files

Once a file is uploaded, you can easily obtain a link to share it.

### Copying the Link Directly
The most common and useful way to share a file is by copying its direct link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17">[04:17]</a>.
1.  Locate the uploaded file in your MediaFire folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02">[04:02]</a>.
2.  Click the three small dots next to the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12">[04:12]</a>.
3.  Select "Copy Link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14">[04:14]</a>.
4.  The link is now copied to your clipboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21">[04:21]</a>. Anyone with this link can paste it into their browser and download the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24">[04:24]</a>.

### Using the Share Menu for More Options
Alternatively, you can access a more detailed share menu:
1.  Click the "Share" option (different from "Copy Link") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>.
2.  This menu also provides the file link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45">[04:45]</a>.
3.  From here, you can modify sharing settings, such as who can access the link or if it's for single sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49">[04:49]</a>.

Sharing MediaFire file links is a very useful method for distributing files to colleagues or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>.

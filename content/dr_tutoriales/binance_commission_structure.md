Binance charges various commissions for transactions on its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Understanding and reducing these fees can help users save money and invest more in cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The platform imposes [[exchange_commission_structures_and_fees | commission fees]] across five main types of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Commission Categories and Reduction Methods

The five main areas where Binance charges commissions are deposits, internal transfers, trading operations (buy/sell), Visa card usage, and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

### 1. Deposits

Deposits can be made in both fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

*   **Fiat Deposits**: When depositing national currencies like Euro or Dollar, various [[methods_for_reducing_deposit_fees_on_binance | methods to reduce Binance commissions]] are available, including bank transfers, banking cards, or specific wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Recommended Method**: Bank transfer is often recommended for its lower commission costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Bank N26**: For users in Europe, it is advised to use a digital bank like Bank N26 for zero-commission transactions to the UK or other non-EU countries, as traditional bank transfers from an English country might incur additional bank commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Fiat deposits via bank transfer typically take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Deposits**: Binance generally does not charge any [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commission]] for receiving cryptocurrencies from another account or wallet, such as Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. However, the sending platform may impose its own fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Referral Link**: New users can receive a 10% discount on commissions across various transactions, including deposits, by using a referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This is part of [[how_binance_referrals_work | how Binance referrals work]].

### 2. Internal Transfers

Transfers within a user's Binance account, such as moving funds from a spot wallet to a futures wallet, are free of [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_conversion | commission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

### 3. Trading Operations (Buy/Sell)

Commissions on buying and selling cryptocurrencies are structured by VIP levels and can be reduced through specific strategies.

*   **VIP Levels**: Users are assigned VIP levels (VIP 0 to VIP 9) based on their trading volume in spot or futures markets, and their BNB balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. Higher VIP levels result in lower commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
    *   **BNB Balance**: The BNB balance considered for VIP level calculation is the amount held in the flexible savings or available spot wallet, not locked savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Paying with BNB**: A significant way to save on transaction fees is to enable the option to pay commissions with BNB, which grants a 25% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
    *   For example, the standard 0.1% commission is reduced to 0.075% when paying with BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
    *   This option requires having some BNB in your spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.
*   [[using_discounts_on_binance_to_save_on_transaction_fees | Using discounts on Binance to save on transaction fees]] makes BNB a useful cryptocurrency for reducing commissions and improving the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   **Margin Lending/Futures Loan**: Interest rates for margin lending and futures loans are also influenced by the amount of Bitcoin or BNB held in the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.

### 4. Binance Visa Card Usage

Using the Binance Visa card offers a refund (cashback) on payments made with the card, which is determined by the amount of BNB held by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. For instance, holding 10 BNB can result in a 2% refund on card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

### 5. Withdrawals

Withdrawals can be made in both fiat money and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

*   **Fiat Withdrawals**: For withdrawing fiat currency, options like bank transfer or Visa card are available.
    *   A bank transfer may incur an 0.8% commission on euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
    *   Similar to deposits, using Bank N26 is recommended to avoid commissions when receiving money from an English bank account into a Spanish bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
    *   Bank transfers typically take one to two business days, while card withdrawals are faster but potentially cost more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Withdrawals**: When transferring cryptocurrencies to another account or a cold wallet, commissions depend on the network used for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>.
    *   For example, a Bitcoin withdrawal might cost 30 cents, while a BNB chain withdrawal could cost 0.07 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.
    *   Currently, these specific withdrawal commissions cannot be reduced, except for a general discount potentially offered through referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
    *   Users should ensure they are withdrawing to a correct recipient address and note that the commission amount is returned to the current account by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.
    *   A minimum withdrawal amount applies for each cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.

### Methods for Adding Money from Your Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

PayPal provides two primary ways to add money from your bank account:

1.  **Using a [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked bank account]]**:
    *   You can use a bank account already [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Log in to your bank's online services to complete the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  **Manual Bank Transfer**:
    *   Go to your physical bank or use your bank's online transfer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
    *   Perform a transfer to the specific PayPal banking account details provided on the screen (including IBAN and beneficiary bank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   It is important not to put anything in the "concept" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Ensure the name of the beneficiary is correctly entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   You will receive an email confirmation once the transfer is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   Transfers typically take one to two working days to reflect in your PayPal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Important Note on [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | Linking a Bank Account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

*   **Requirement**: It is crucial that the bank account you are using for the transfer is [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to your PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Rejection of Unlinked Transfers**: If you attempt a transfer from a bank account that is not [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to your PayPal account]], the transfer will be automatically rejected because PayPal will not recognize it as associated with your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

2.  **Confirmation**: You will then need to log back into PayPal and confirm the exact amount of that small transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

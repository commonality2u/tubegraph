This guide explains how to view and manage geolocation data and other metadata within photos using a free mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This process allows users to determine where specific photos were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Recommended Application: Xip (Exif Metadata Viewer)

To view photo metadata, a free mobile application called "Xip" (an Exif metadata viewer) is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.
*   **Availability**: It can be found in the Apple App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Searching for "Exif, meta data" will bring up the orange application icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Rating**: The app has 153 reviews and a 4.5-star rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Cost**: While a Pro option exists, the [[free_versus_pro_options_of_photo_location_apps | free option]] is sufficient for viewing metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
*   **Language**: The app interface is in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## How to Determine Photo Location and Other Metadata

1.  **Download and Open**: Once downloaded, open the Xip app on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Grant Access**: The first step is to allow the application to [[using_apps_to_access_metadata_and_geolocation | access your photos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Select Photos**: Choose the photos you wish to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The app allows you to select photos taken by yourself or those sent to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
4.  **View Data**: Once selected, the app displays the metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Understanding the Displayed Information

The app displays various details about the photo, including:
*   **Image Size** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   **Camera Details**: This includes the camera model (e.g., iPhone 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Lens Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   **Geolocation Data**: If enabled, this includes longitude, latitude, and specific coordinates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This data can be viewed on a map within the app, showing the exact location where the photo was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Managing Geolocation Permissions

It's important to note that not all mobile phones have geolocation activated when taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This setting can be controlled in [[location_sharing_and_tracking_controls | permissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. If [[appspecific_location_permissions | location permissions]] were not enabled, the metadata will not show location information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### [[examples_and_use_cases_of_photo_geolocation | Examples and Use Cases]]

*   **Photo with Geolocation**: A photo of a bear graffiti in Bristol, England, clearly shows its location and exact coordinates on a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Similarly, a photo taken at Niagara Falls accurately detected its location from Skylon Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. A photo from an Oxford conference also displayed its location at Mansfield College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Photo without Geolocation**: A photo of a lecture in Switzerland did not display location data because the sender did not have location enabled when taking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Adding and Viewing New Photos

You can add new photos to the app for analysis at any time by pressing the plus button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

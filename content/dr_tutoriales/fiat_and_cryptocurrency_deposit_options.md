## Depositing Funds on Binance

You can deposit both fiat currency and cryptocurrencies directly onto the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Depositing Fiat Currency]]

Fiat currencies are national currencies such as the Euro, US Dollar, Pound Sterling, Rubles, and Czech Crowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. The available deposit methods and their associated commissions can vary depending on the chosen currency and the current market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

Possible methods include:
*   **Visa/MC Bank Card**: May incur a commission, for example, 1.8% for Euro and Pound Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   **P2P Bank Transfer**: Can be 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet Make Cash**: Can be 0% commission, though additional fees might apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
*   **SWIFT Bank Transfer**: For US Dollars, this method might have 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **SEPA Transfers / Quick Payments**: These methods have sometimes been temporarily suspended in certain countries within the European community due to ongoing analysis of transfers and legality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Depositing Cryptocurrencies]]

You can also deposit various cryptocurrencies accepted by the Binance platform, such as TRON (TRX) or Litecoin (LTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. The cost of these deposits will depend on the blockchain network used for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## Using Alternative Platforms for Cost-Effective Deposits

If direct fiat deposit commissions on Binance seem high, an alternative strategy is to use another platform for the initial fiat deposit, [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency | convert that fiat into a cryptocurrency]] with low transfer fees, and then send the cryptocurrency to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. This approach can be beneficial given Binance's range of investment products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### Example: Using Kraken for Fiat Deposit and Crypto Transfer

1.  **Fiat Deposit on Kraken**:
    *   Many platforms like Kraken may allow fiat deposits (e.g., Euros via SEPA/SWIFT) with 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
    *   Such transfers typically take 1 to 2 business days to credit your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

2.  **Convert Fiat to Cryptocurrency on Kraken**:
    *   Converting Euros to a cryptocurrency like Bitcoin on Kraken might incur a commission, for example, around 0.16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. For a 2,000 Euro deposit, this would be approximately 3.2 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>.
    *   It is advisable to [[choosing_payment_methods_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | choose cryptocurrencies]] known for their low transaction costs when transferring between platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Examples of such cryptocurrencies include:
        *   **Litecoin (LTC)**: Has very low shipping costs (e.g., 0.02 LTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.
        *   **TRON (TRX)**: Also has very low costs (e.g., 2 TRX minimum amount, roughly 10 cents USD to send) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

3.  **Transfer Cryptocurrency to Binance**:
    *   Transferring the chosen low-cost cryptocurrency from Kraken to Binance would incur its own transfer fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
    *   Using TRON as an example, the total estimated cost for a 2,000 Euro deposit would be:
        *   Fiat deposit on Kraken: 0 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>
        *   Conversion from Euros to TRON: ~3.2 Euros (0.16% commission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>
        *   TRON transfer fee to Binance: ~0.10 USD (converted to Euro, approximately 0.10 Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>
        *   **Total Estimated Cost**: Approximately 3.3 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

### Other Alternative Platforms

Other platforms like KuCoin and Bit2Me (Coinbase is also mentioned as an option for deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>) can also be used following a similar strategy:
*   **KuCoin**: May offer lower trading commissions (e.g., 0.1%) for converting fiat to crypto compared to other platforms, potentially reducing the conversion cost for 2,000 Euros to 2 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. KuCoin is considered safe for deposits and shipments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
*   **Bit2Me**: This platform might charge very low fees for SEPA transfers (e.g., 0.50-0.75 Euros) for fiat deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. The main cost here would be [[converting_crypto_to_fiat_currency | converting the fiat currency]] to the desired cryptocurrency before transferring to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

Before proceeding, it is important to understand the specifics of blockchain transfers.

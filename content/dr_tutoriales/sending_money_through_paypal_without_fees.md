Sending money from one PayPal account to another can be done in a few simple steps, often without incurring fees, especially when sending to friends within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This process is consistent whether using a computer or a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To send money, you must have an existing PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. If you don't have one, it can be created quickly and easily without needing to [[creating_a_paypal_account_without_a_credit_card | link a bank account or any card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

## Steps to Send Money

1.  **Log In**: Access your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Transfer**: Navigate to the "quick links" section or locate the "send money" option on your dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:06">[01:26:06]</a>.
3.  **Enter Recipient Details**: A screen will prompt you to enter the recipient's PayPal contact information. This can be their username or email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:53">[01:40:53]</a>.
4.  **Specify Amount**: Input the amount of money you wish to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
5.  **Add a Note (Optional)**: You can include a note or description for the payment, such as "subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
6.  **Select Payment Type**:
    *   **Sending to a friend**: Choose this option if the payment is a personal transfer. Sending money to a friend is completely free when paying in euros within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Paying for an article or service**: Select this if you are making a purchase. In this scenario, the seller typically pays a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Payments for goods or services are covered by PayPal's buyer protection, which includes encryption and fraud prevention measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. It is recommended to review the terms and conditions for buying or selling items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
7.  **Confirm Payment Source**: You can use your PayPal balance to send the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
8.  **Finalize Transaction**: Click "send payment now" to complete the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Transaction Confirmation and History

After sending, your PayPal balance will update, reflecting the deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. You can view the transaction history, which displays the payment status (e.g., "unclaimed" if the recipient hasn't accepted it yet) and a transaction ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. You also have the option to print a receipt of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.

## Receiving Money

On the recipient's end, the money will appear in their PayPal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. They can view the details of the incoming payment in their activity history, including the sender's account name, the purpose of the money, and the date received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. Transfers typically take around five minutes to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.

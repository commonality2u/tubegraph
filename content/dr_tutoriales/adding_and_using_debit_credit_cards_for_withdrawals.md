Withdrawing cryptocurrency from a platform like Coinbase to a bank account can be done through various methods, including the use of debit or credit cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24"></a>. This process involves converting your digital assets into conventional fiat money before it can be transferred to your bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32"></a>.

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat

Before any withdrawal to a bank account, including via card, your cryptocurrencies must first be converted into a legal tender currency, such as Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57"></a>. This is because cryptocurrencies like Polygon (MATIC) are not legal tender and cannot be directly stored or transferred to traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50"></a>.

To convert your crypto:
1.  Navigate to the "operate" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06"></a>.
2.  Select the option to sell your coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08"></a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to sell (e.g., MATIC) and convert it to your desired fiat currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11"></a>.
4.  Confirm the sale, noting any commissions involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34"></a>. For example, selling 2.76 MATIC might incur a 1 Euro commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43"></a>. For lower commissions, consider using platforms like [[using_alternative_platforms_for_crypto_to_fiat_withdrawal | Coinbase Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49"></a>.

## Withdrawing Funds Using a Debit/Credit Card

Once your funds are converted to fiat currency, you can initiate a withdrawal:
1.  Go to the "Euro" section of your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10"></a>.
2.  Select the "withdraw funds" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12"></a>.
3.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15"></a>. For instance, you could choose to withdraw 50 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18"></a>.
4.  The system will prompt you to add a debit or credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24"></a>. Your funds will then be withdrawn to the linked account associated with that card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31"></a>.

### Fees and Recommendations

Using a debit or credit card for withdrawals is generally **not recommended** due to high associated commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33"></a>. These fees can be around **21.5%** of the withdrawal amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36"></a>.

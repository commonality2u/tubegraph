This article explains how to automatically organize emails into folders in Gmail, building on the assumption that folders have already been created.

## Organizing Emails Automatically in Gmail

To automatically organize emails in Gmail, users can [[using_filters_in_gmail_to_manage_emails | create filters]] that direct incoming messages to specific folders, bypassing the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This method helps to [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | prioritize and sort emails]] by grouping related messages together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Prerequisites: Existing Folders

Before setting up automatic organization, you must have existing folders (referred to as "labels" in Gmail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Common folder examples might include "YouTube," "Social Networks," "Google," or "Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The process for [[creating_labels_in_gmail | creating these folders]] is covered in a separate tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

### Steps to Automate Email Organization

1.  **Access Gmail**: Open your trusted browser, such as Google Chrome, and navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Identify an Email for Filtering**: Select an email from the sender you wish to filter. For example, to filter YouTube notifications, select an email from `noreply@youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Filter Creation**:
    *   Click on the three vertical dots (More options) located in the email view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   Select "Filter messages like this" from the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Filter Criteria**: A dialog box will appear, pre-filling the "From" field with the sender's email address (e.g., `noreply@youtube.com`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
5.  **Create Filter**: Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
6.  **Configure Filter Actions**: In the next screen, specify how emails matching the criteria should be handled:
    *   **"Skip the Inbox (Archive it)"**: Check this option so that new emails from this sender do not appear in your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **"Apply the label:"**: Check this option and select the specific folder (label) where these emails should be moved (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **"Also apply filter to X matching conversations"**: Check this to move all existing emails from this sender into the chosen folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
7.  **Finalize Filter**: Click "Create filter" to save your settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Outcome

Once the filter is created, all past and future emails from the specified sender will be automatically moved into the designated folder, bypassing the inbox and remaining unread until accessed in their respective folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

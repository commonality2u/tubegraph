## Initial Setup Process

To begin, access the official PayPal website. This can be done by searching for "PayPal" or by using a direct link, often provided in video descriptions or comments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

### Step-by-Step Account Creation

1.  **Accept Cookies**: Upon entering the PayPal page, accept the cookies to proceed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>
2.  **Create a Free Account**: Select the option to "create a free account". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
3.  **Choose Account Type**:
    *   Opt for a **personal account** if your primary goal is to buy, receive money, or return funds without sharing payment information. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
    *   A business account is typically used for buying and selling products in larger quantities, managing invoices, and selling to a wider audience. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>
4.  **Mobile Phone Verification**: Enter your mobile phone number. A verification code will be sent to this number, which you must enter to proceed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>
5.  **Profile Configuration**: Fill in the required personal details:
    *   Email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
    *   First name and surname <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>
    *   A password for your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>
    *   *Note*: Your email address and password will be used for future logins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
6.  **Billing Address and Terms**: Provide your billing address, date of birth, city, and province/residence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> Before finalizing, confirm that you have read the conditions of use and privacy policy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
7.  **Create Account**: Click "accept and create account" to complete this stage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>

## Avoiding Card Linkage

Immediately after creating the account, PayPal may prompt you to [[linking_a_credit_or_debit_card_to_paypal | link a credit or debit card]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> To avoid this, do not proceed with this option. Instead, navigate back to the main PayPal page by searching for "PayPal" and logging into your newly created account. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>

## Email Verification

A critical final step to fully activate your account without a linked card is to verify your email address. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

1.  **Check Notifications**: On the PayPal homepage, look for a notification, often in the bell icon, prompting you to "finish setting up your account" or "confirm the email you received". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
2.  **Confirm Email**: Click "confirm". PayPal will send a confirmation email to the address you provided during registration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>
3.  **Access Email**: Go to your email inbox, open the PayPal confirmation email, and click on the provided link to confirm your address. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
4.  **Enter Password**: You may be asked to enter your PayPal password to confirm your identity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
5.  **Final Check**: After confirming, you might be redirected to a page again suggesting to [[linking_a_credit_or_debit_card_to_paypal | link a credit or debit card]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> Again, ignore this prompt and navigate back to the main PayPal page. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>

You now have a fully functional PayPal account with a confirmed email, ready for activities like [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | receiving payments]], without needing to link a credit or debit card. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>

### Linking a Card Later (Optional)

If you decide to [[linking_a_credit_or_debit_card_to_paypal | link a credit or debit card]] at a later point, you can do so by clicking on the option under your name, often labeled "keep your secure financial information when purchasing on the internet." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> This will allow you to enter your card details. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>

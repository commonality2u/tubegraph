It is possible to [[paypal_account_setup_for_sending_money | create a PayPal account]] without immediately linking a debit or credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This allows users to receive payments and send funds to others within the PayPal platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, or make purchases from various businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. PayPal is a useful tool for receiving payments from platforms like link shorteners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin, access the official PayPal page, which can be found via a direct link or by searching for "PayPal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Upon entering the site, it is necessary to accept cookies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Account Type Selection

When creating a new account, PayPal offers two options:
*   **Personal Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>: Recommended for essential functionalities such as buying, receiving, or [[sending_money_through_paypal_without_fees | sending money]] without sharing payment information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   **Business Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>: Suited for buying and selling mass products, preparing invoices, and selling globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. For creating an account without a card, a Personal Account is typically sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Initial Account Setup

1.  **Mobile Phone Verification**: Enter a mobile phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. PayPal will send a verification code to this number, which must be entered to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
2.  **Profile Configuration**: Fill in your email address, first name, last name, and create a password for your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This email and password will be used for future logins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
3.  **Address and Terms**: Provide your billing address, including date of birth, city, and province <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Confirm that you have read and accepted the conditions of use and privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Bypassing Card Link During Creation

After the initial setup, PayPal will prompt you to link a card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. To create the account without providing card details, return to the main PayPal page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> and log in to your newly created account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## [[Verifying a PayPal account with email | Email Verification]]

The critical step to complete the account setup without a card is to [[verifying_a_paypal_account_with_email | confirm your email address]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

1.  Look for a notification within your PayPal account interface that prompts you to "confirm the email you received" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
2.  Click on the confirmation option, and PayPal will send a verification email to the address you provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
3.  Open the email from PayPal and click the "confirm email" link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
4.  You will be prompted to enter your PayPal password to finalize the email confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

After successful email verification, your PayPal account is fully confirmed and ready for use without a linked credit or debit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. While the option to link a card might still appear as a notification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, it is not mandatory for initial functionality.

### Linking a Card Later (Optional)

If you wish to [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | link a credit or debit card]] at a later time, you can do so by navigating to the "secure financial information" section under your name within the PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

## Making Google the Default Search Engine in Chrome

It's common for Google Chrome to have Google set as the default search engine [00:00:34]. However, there are instances where another search engine, such as Yahoo or Bing, might become your default [00:00:36]. This can sometimes happen inadvertently when downloading certain extensions or programs that modify your browser settings [00:01:28].

This guide will show you how to ensure Google is your chosen default search engine [00:00:57].

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Open Google Chrome** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  **Access Chrome Settings**: Click on the three-dot menu icon located in the top-right corner of your browser window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  **Navigate to Settings**: From the dropdown menu, select "Settings" (or "Configuration" if your browser is in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This action will open a new tab with your browser's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
4.  **Go to Search Engine Settings**: On the left-hand sidebar of the Settings page, look for and click on "Search Engine" (or "Motor de Búsqueda" in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This section allows you to manage different search engines like Yahoo, Google, and many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
5.  **[[managing_search_engines_in_google_chrome | Manage Search Engines]]**: Within the "Search Engine" section, click on the option that says "Manage Search Engines" (or "Administrar Motores de Búsqueda") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
6.  **Set Google as Default**:
    *   You will see a list of search engines currently installed or available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
    *   If Google is listed, ensure it's selected as your default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   If another search engine like Bing, Yahoo, or Ecosia is currently set as default, you can change it here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
7.  **Add Google if Not Listed**:
    *   If Google is not present in the list of your search engines, you will need to add it manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Click the "Add" button (often represented by a pencil icon if editing an existing entry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   In the provided fields, enter "Google" for the search engine name and "google.com" for the shortcut or URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to use `google.com` as the domain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Using country-specific domains like `google.es` or `google.uk` might lead to problems if you are not physically located in that respective country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
8.  **Save Changes**: Once you have made your selection or added Google, ensure you save the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. There is no need to save anything else after this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## PayPal Account Setup for Sending Money

This guide outlines the process of sending money from one PayPal account to another, including how to track transactions and understand buyer protection. The steps described apply to both computer and mobile phone interfaces, as the options are fundamentally similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Prerequisites

To send money via PayPal, you must first have an active PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. If you do not have one, it can be created in a few simple steps without the need to [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | link a bank account]] or any card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Steps to Send Money

1.  **Log In to PayPal**: Access the PayPal platform and log in to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Your balance will be displayed on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Send Money**:
    *   Look for the "quick links" section on the dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Select the "Send money" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This option may also appear prominently at the top of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
3.  **Enter Recipient Information**: A new screen will appear where you need to enter the PayPal contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. You can use either the recipient's username or email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
4.  **Specify Amount and Purpose**:
    *   Enter the desired amount to send, for example, twenty-five euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Add a note or description for the payment, such as "subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
5.  **Continue and Select Payment Type**: Click "continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. You will be prompted to choose the purpose of the payment:
    *   **"For a friend"**: This option is typically free when paying in euros within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   **"For an article or service"**: This is for [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | online transactions]] where you are buying or selling an item <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. With this option, the seller usually pays a fee, and the transaction may be covered by buyer protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
6.  **Select Payment Source**: Choose "PayPal balance" as your payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
7.  **Confirm Payment**: Review the details and click "send payment now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A confirmation message will appear stating the amount sent and to whom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Transaction Details and Buyer Protection

*   **Viewing Transaction History**: After sending money, you can check your transaction history by returning to the main page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Your balance will reflect the deduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. The recent activity section will show the payment status, e.g., "unclaimed" if the recipient hasn't yet accepted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Transaction Details**: Clicking on a transaction shows its status, transaction ID, contact information, and a summary of the action taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. You can also print a receipt for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Buyer Protection
> PayPal offers buyer protection for eligible items or services purchased, which helps safeguard against fraud by encrypting data and monitoring transactions 24/7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. It is recommended to review the conditions of buyer protection, especially when buying or selling items, to avoid being scammed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Receiving Confirmation

The recipient will see the funds credited to their PayPal balance shortly after the sender completes the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The transaction details, including the sender's account name, the purpose of the payment, and the amount received, will be visible in the recipient's activity section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The process typically takes approximately five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

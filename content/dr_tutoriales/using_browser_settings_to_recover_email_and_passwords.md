It is possible to [[recovering_a_forgotten_gmail_password | recover your Gmail password]] or even [[recovering_a_gmail_account_without_remembering_the_email | recover a Gmail account without remembering the email]] itself by leveraging previously accessed devices and browser settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Key Considerations Before Recovery

A vital step for successful recovery is to attempt the process from a computer or mobile phone that has previously accessed the email account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This is crucial because Google uses the device's access history as a reference to verify your identity and facilitate password or account recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Method 1: Recovering Through Google Chrome Settings

This method is highly effective if you have previously accessed your email from the device you are currently using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. It can be used whether you have [[recovering_a_gmail_account_without_remembering_the_email | forgotten the email]] or just the password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Steps to Access Saved Passwords:

2.  **Navigate to Settings**:
    *   Open a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   Go to the three-dot menu on the right side of the browser window and select "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  **Access Password Section**:
    *   Within the [[managing_search_engine_settings_in_google_chrome | settings]] menu, go to the "Autofill" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Click on "Password" to view all saved passwords for various accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

    *   A list of all saved Gmail accounts and their associated passwords will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
5.  **Reveal Password**:
    *   Click the "eye" icon next to the desired account to reveal the password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   You will be prompted to enter your computer's PIN or password for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   Once confirmed, the password along with the associated email account will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

> [!TIP]

*   **Providing a previously used password**: If you remember an old password for the account, Google might recognize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

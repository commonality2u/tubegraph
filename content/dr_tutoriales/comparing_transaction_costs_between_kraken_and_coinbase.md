When considering withdrawing cryptocurrency funds to a bank account, it is important to compare the transaction costs across different platforms. The tutorial highlights that [[using_different_platforms_like_kraken_and_crypto_dotcom_for_better_exchange_rates | Kraken]] is generally preferred over [[comparing_withdrawal_options_and_fees_on_coinbase | Coinbase]] for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Coinbase Transaction Costs

Coinbase is noted to charge higher fees for withdrawing funds directly to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. For instance, when [[using_kraken_to_transfer_ethereum | transferring Ethereum]] from a Coinbase wallet to Kraken, the commission cost observed was between 5.79 and 6.52 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This fee is for the outbound transfer of cryptocurrency from Coinbase, which is part of the overall process if [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms_to_save_on_fees | transferring between platforms to save on withdrawal fees]].

## Kraken Advantages

[[Using_thirdparty_platforms_like_kraken_for_crypto_withdrawals | Kraken]] is recommended as an alternative for withdrawals because Coinbase charges more for direct bank withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Users can also potentially receive a 20% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits on Kraken by using a referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Strategy for Cost Savings

To mitigate the higher withdrawal fees on Coinbase, a common strategy involves [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms_to_save_on_fees | transferring cryptocurrencies]] (such as Ethereum) from Coinbase to Kraken, and then initiating the bank withdrawal from Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This approach leverages Kraken's potentially lower withdrawal fees to the user's bank account.

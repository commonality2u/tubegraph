When performing cryptocurrency transactions, such as transferring Bitcoin from one exchange to another, [[exchange_commission_structures_and_fees | commission fees]] are typically incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. These fees are deducted from the total amount being transferred.

## Understanding Commission Fees on Transfers

For instance, when transferring Bitcoin from a Coinbase account to a Binance account, a [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commission fee]] is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. In one observed case, a transfer of 110.39 units resulted in 109.70 units arriving at the destination, indicating a fee of slightly less than one Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

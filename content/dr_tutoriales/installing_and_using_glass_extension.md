The Glass extension is a [[using_google_chrome_extensions_for_transcription | Google Chrome extension]] designed to convert YouTube video content into text [00:00:00]. It utilizes ChatGPT to perform this conversion, providing a transcript and summary of the video [00:00:17]. While it can be installed in Safari and used from Python, this guide focuses on its use within [[activating_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | Google Chrome]] [00:00:23].

## Installation
To install Glass:
1.  Navigate to the Chrome web store or the relevant page to install the extension [00:00:34].

## Usage
Once the Glass extension is installed in your [[activating_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | Google Chrome]] browser:
1.  Open a new tab and go to the YouTube platform [00:00:40].
2.  Select and enter any YouTube video you wish to transcribe [00:00:46].
3.  After the video loads, a small window titled "transcript and summery" (meaning "Transcript and abstract") will appear [00:00:57].
4.  Click on this "transcript and summery" window [00:01:02].
5.  The extension will display the video's audio segments, and for each minute or sequence of seconds, a paragraph containing the spoken content will appear [00:01:07]. This detailed transcript covers the entire video [00:01:15].

## Copying the Transcript
The generated transcript can be easily copied for external use:
*   **Manual Selection:** You can select the desired text within the transcript window and copy it, then paste it into a document like Word [00:01:27].
*   **Direct Copy:** The extension also provides a direct "Copy here as text" option for immediate copying of the entire transcript [00:01:34].

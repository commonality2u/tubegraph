Reducing the file size of PDF documents is essential for various reasons, such as meeting minimum size requirements for online submissions (e.g., WhatsApp, email, other platforms) or simply to save storage space on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Using I Love PDF for Compression

One effective method for [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | compressing PDFs]] is by using online tools like I Love PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This platform offers various functions, including joining, splitting, and compressing PDF files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Compression Process

1.  **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the I Love PDF website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Select Compression Option**: Choose the "Compress PDF" function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  **Upload PDF**: Select the PDF file you wish to compress from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, a "Fati Case Stadis" document was used, initially weighing approximately 7.82 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
4.  **Choose Compression Setting**: I Love PDF provides different [[comparison_of_compression_settings | compression settings]]:
    *   **Extreme Compression**: Offers the highest reduction in size but results in the lowest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   **Recommended Compression**: A balanced option that provides significant size reduction with acceptable quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Low Compression**: Offers the least size reduction but maintains higher quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    Reducing quality is a sacrifice made to achieve compression, affecting elements like images, videos, and text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
5.  **Initiate Compression**: Click "Compress PDF" to start the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Verifying Compression Results

After compression, the tool will display the reduction achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For instance, a PDF initially 7.82 megabytes was reduced to 1.76 megabytes, representing a 78% decrease in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

To [[checking_compressed_file_size | check the compressed file size]]:
*   Download the new PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Locate the downloaded file.
*   Right-click the file and select "Properties" to view its new size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. In the example, the file size was confirmed to be 1.75 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   The [[impact_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality loss]] might be minimal, especially if the PDF primarily contains text and some images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Further Compression with WinRAR

For even greater size reduction, a PDF compressed using I Love PDF can be [[additional_compression_with_windrard | further compressed]] using [[compressing_files_using_winrar | WinRAR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This combines different [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | compression methods]] to achieve optimal results.

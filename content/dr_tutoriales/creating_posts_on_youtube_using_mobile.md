## Getting Started

To begin, you must have the [[using_the_youtube_app_for_android_and_iphone | YouTube app]] downloaded on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. If you don't have it, download it from the App Store (for iPhone) or Google Play (for Android) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Once the app is installed, open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a> and ensure you are registered/signed in with your official YouTube account from which you wish to publish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Steps to Create a Post

1.  **Access the Creation Menu**: Locate the video camera icon, typically found at the top right of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  **Select "Publication"**: Tapping this icon will present options to [[publishing_videos_lives_and_posts_on_youtube | make a video, a live, or a publication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Choose the "publication" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
3.  **Compose Your Post**: Enter the text for your post, such as "how are you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a> or "Have a nice day" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   **Optional Additions**: From your mobile phone, you also have the ability to [[adding_photos_and_surveys_to_youtube_posts | add photos]] or [[adding_photos_and_surveys_to_youtube_posts | add surveys]] to your post <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
4.  **Publish**: Once your post is ready, select "publish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The post will then be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Viewing Your Post

After publishing, you can view how the post turned out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It will be visible to your followers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

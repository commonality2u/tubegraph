This guide outlines the process for [[inserting_signatures_and_other_elements_in_pdfs | inserting signatures within PDF files]], specifically focusing on how to use your own signature to fill and sign documents digitally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The tutorial covers steps from opening the PDF to saving the signed version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## How to Fill and Sign a PDF

To begin, ensure you have the PDF file you wish to sign, and if using an image, your signature image (scanned or a photo) readily available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Step 1: Open the PDF Document
First, open the target PDF file on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Step 2: Access the "Fill & Sign" Option
Once the PDF is open, locate and select the "Fill & Sign" option, which typically appears on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This option provides features to "fill out, sign, and send" or "obtain the signature of others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. For self-signing, choose "fill and sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Step 3: Navigate to the Signature Area
Scroll down to the desired location within the document where you want to place your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Step 4: Add Your Signature
You have several methods to add a signature:

*   **Type Text:** You can type text, such as "subscribe," in a chosen font style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, with millions of styles available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Draw a Signature:** You can draw your signature directly using your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Use an Image:** Upload an image of your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This image can be a scanned version or a photo of your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To add an image signature:
1.  Click the "Sign" button, typically found at the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Select "Add a signature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
3.  Choose the image file of your signature (e.g., from your desktop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  Once added, you can click and drag the signature to reposition it, and resize it to fit the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Step 5: Save the Signed PDF
After placing your signature, it's crucial to [[saving_signed_pdf_files | save the signed PDF file]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
1.  Go to "File" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Select "Save As" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
3.  Provide a new name for the file (e.g., "file name signed Harriet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

You will then have both the original unsigned PDF and the newly signed version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

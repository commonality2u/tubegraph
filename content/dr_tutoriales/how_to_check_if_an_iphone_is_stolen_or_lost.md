Checking if an iPhone is stolen or lost is a very simple process that is highly recommended before purchasing a second-hand device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This tutorial will guide you through the necessary [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | steps to verify a used iPhone before purchase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Essential Requirements

To perform this check, you will need two main things:
1.  Access to a specific web page (the link is usually provided in the first comment of the video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
2.  The mobile device you wish to check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The most crucial piece of information from the device is its [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### Understanding the IMEI Number

The [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI number]] is the unique identification number for an Apple device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, similar to a fingerprint for your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. When an iPhone is lost, disappeared, or stolen, its [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI number]] can be registered with Apple as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This registration allows potential buyers to determine if a device they are considering purchasing has been reported stolen or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It is always recommended to [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | check the IMEI number]] before buying a second-hand device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## [[locating_the_imei_number_on_your_device | Locating the IMEI Number]]

Before checking the status online, you need to [[locating_the_imei_number_on_your_device | find the IMEI number]] on the iPhone itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### For an Activated iPhone

For a device that is already running and accessible, you can [[locating_the_imei_number_on_your_device | find the IMEI]] by navigating through the device's settings:
1.  Go to **Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Select **General** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### [[understanding_dual_sim_iphones_and_their_imei_numbers | Dual SIM iPhones]]

It's important to note that if your iPhone has [[understanding_dual_sim_iphones_and_their_imei_numbers | dual SIM]] capabilities, it will typically have two [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Each [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI]] is associated with a SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In such cases, you must perform the check for both [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI numbers]] to ensure the device is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### For Locked or Reset iPhones

If the device is locked or has been reset to its initial setup screen (e.g., when buying new or after a factory reset), you can still [[locating_the_imei_number_on_your_device | find the IMEI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The video indicates that a screenshot illustrating how to find the [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI]] on a locked screen is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Additionally, the [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI]] might also be found on the device's casing or within the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Checking the IMEI Status Online

Once you have the [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI number]](s), proceed to the designated web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
1.  **Enter the IMEI:** Copy and paste the [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI number]] into the provided field on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  **Verify Captcha:** Confirm that you are not a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
3.  **Check Status:** Click the "check" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The website will then tell you if the [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI]] is reported as stolen, lost, or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, it will indicate if [[importance_of_find_my_iphone_feature | Find My iPhone]] is activated and whether the device is unlocked or "not in the BlackBook" (meaning it's not reported as stolen) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Remember to repeat this process for all [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI numbers]] if it's a [[understanding_dual_sim_iphones_and_their_imei_numbers | dual SIM iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

By following these [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | steps]], you can ensure that a second-hand iPhone you intend to purchase is legitimate and not a stolen or lost device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

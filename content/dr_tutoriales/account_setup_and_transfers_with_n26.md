This guide explains how to use the [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26 Bank]] application from a mobile device, focusing on basic operations, account setup, and various types of transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The aim is to optimize the banking experience for efficiency and usefulness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Key Features of N26

[[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26 Bank]] is known for not charging commissions on domestic or international transfers, which can be problematic with many other banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for international transactions, such as transfers to the UK or USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Creating an N26 Account
A previous video tutorial covers the step-by-step process of [[introduction_to_n26_bank | creating an N26 account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Users are encouraged to use a referral code, often provided in the video's description, which can grant five euros upon account opening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The speaker uses the standard, basic N26 account, which is completely free and incurs no monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## [[n26_app_menu_navigation_and_setup | N26 App Menu Navigation and Setup]]

The N26 application is consistent across both iPhone and Android operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Users can find the app typically within a "finance" group on their device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Application Layout
Upon opening, the app displays a default screen with two main menus:
*   **Lower Menu:** Features sections like "Start," "Spaces," "Exploring," and "Cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Upper Menu:** Includes options for viewing user profile, accessing help/questions, seeing statistics and upcoming payments, and searching for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Profile Management
The profile section allows users to manage their account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Account Information:** Displays the account's IBAN and a QR code for instant transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Visibility Settings:** Users can activate visibility to allow other N26 users to send them money instantly via QR code, phone number, or email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   **Invite Friends:** An option to invite friends to N26, potentially earning both parties five euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

*   **Bank Change:** N26 offers a service to assist with changing bank accounts, although the speaker uses N26 specifically for [[using_bank_n26_for_commission_savings | international transfers]] rather than as a primary national bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Help and Support
The "questions" section provides access to help, including a chat feature that can connect users with a robot or a physical person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Accessing private chat information requires verification via a paired device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

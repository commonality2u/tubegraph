## Backup Process

It is crucial to back up your [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]]'s recovery phrase, as losing it means you will not be able to access your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

You have two main backup options:
1.  **iCloud Backup**: Allows for cloud backup of your recovery phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
2.  **Manual Backup**: Involves manually copying the 12 words of your recovery phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This can be done by taking a screenshot of the words and then copying them to a secure location like a notepad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. After copying, you will be asked to re-enter the words in the correct order to confirm the backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

## General Security Advice
While [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] is an independent wallet separate from the main Coinbase platform, any transfers between them or other platforms will incur associated blockchain commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

This strategy helps manage costs while securely holding and managing your crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

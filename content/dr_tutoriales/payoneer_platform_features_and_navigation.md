## Accessing the Payoneer Platform

The Payoneer platform can be accessed via a computer for a full view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Navigating the Payoneer Interface

Upon logging in, users will see an interactive menu on the left side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

*   **Beginning Part (Dashboard)**: Displays account balances and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. From here, users can request payments, make payments, or request new currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Receiving**: Allows users to request payments and view their receiving accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Paying**: Enables payments to other Payoneer accounts or directly to recipient bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Withdrawing and Transfers**: Allows users to transfer funds to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Users can select a balance in one currency, such as Euros, and convert it to another, like Dollars, by entering the desired quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. A commission is applied to such exchanges, and users are advised to compare it with the current exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Account Activity**: Provides a detailed view of transactions, payment requests, and allows users to generate monthly account statements, which can be useful for tax declarations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Users can also see their reputation based on reviews and link an Amazon account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Banks & Cards

This section is crucial for [[managing_currencies_and_bank_accounts_in_payoneer | managing currencies and bank accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>:

*   **Receiving Accounts**: Payoneer automatically opens bank accounts for users in various currencies, including USD, Euros, and British Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Users can view details for these accounts, such as bank name and account holder information, and copy them for transfers from other accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Additional currency accounts can be requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. These bank accounts are essential for requesting payments from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **[[payoneer_card_application_and_usage | Payoneer Card]]**: Users can apply for a [[payoneer_card_application_and_usage | Payoneer card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. A requirement for applying is to have received payments of at least $100 in the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Future tutorials will cover the functionality of the [[payoneer_card_application_and_usage | Payoneer card]] in more detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

### Network of Business

For business accounts, this section allows for managing the store, overseeing business operations, viewing companies worked with (who also have company bank accounts), and seeing different business applications linked to the Payoneer platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Users can also refer friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Types of Payoneer Accounts and Their Differences

Payoneer offers two primary [[types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_differences | types of Payoneer accounts]]: individual (or private) accounts and company accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

A key difference lies in transaction compatibility:
*   Users cannot make transfers from a personal bank account to a Payoneer business account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   Conversely, transfers from a Payoneer personal account to a company account are also not permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   For a business Payoneer account, deposits must originate from another compatible company account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Commissions

Information regarding the commissions associated with the Payoneer platform can be found in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Commissions vary depending on the type of transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. While generally not excessively high, it is recommended to review them as they can influence the desirability of certain transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*Note: This tutorial focuses on platform navigation; actual transfers and deposits will be covered in upcoming tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.*

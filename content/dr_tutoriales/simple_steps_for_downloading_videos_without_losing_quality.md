## Steps to Download Facebook Videos

1.  **Locate the Video**
    Navigate to the desired video on Facebook's main page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

2.  **Access Mobile Version**
    In the video's URL, replace "www" and "http" with "m" to access the mobile version of Facebook within your computer's browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This will open the video in the mobile version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

3.  **Open Developer Tools (Inspect)**
    Right-click on a blank part of the video and select "Inspect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This action opens a window, typically on the right side of your screen, displaying the page's code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

4.  **Play the Video Briefly**
    Play the video for two to three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

5.  **Inspect the Video Element**
    Within the developer tools window, click the "inspect video" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Hovering your mouse over the "video" element should highlight the video on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This element represents the original source of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

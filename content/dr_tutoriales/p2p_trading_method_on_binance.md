Binance's Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading platform allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies for fiat currency directly with other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method is particularly useful for converting stablecoins like USDT (US dollar Tether) into USD fiat, an exchange not typically found in standard trading markets on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Accessing P2P Trading

To access the P2P trading interface:
1.  Navigate to the "Trading" section on the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.
2.  Select the "P2P" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

## Understanding P2P Exchange

P2P, or "person to person," facilitates direct exchanges between users through various systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This allows for [[currency_exchange_using_p2p | currency exchange using P2P]] like USDT with the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Selling USDT via P2P

When using P2P to sell USDT for USD:
1.  On the P2P page, select the "Sell" tab for USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
2.  Choose your desired fiat currency for exchange, such as USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. Other cryptocurrencies like BTC, BUSD, or BNB can also be chosen for selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

### Filtering and Selecting Offers
After setting your preferences, available offers from advertisers will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. It's recommended to read and accept the platform's conditions before proceeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

Advertisers display the price of USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. While USDT typically maintains a 1:1 relationship with the USD, advertisers may set their [[how_to_set_prices_for_buying_and_selling_in_p2p | prices for buying and selling in P2P]] to include a small profit margin, e.g., 2 cents per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

You can filter offers by desired payment method, including bank transfer or [[using_paypal_with_binance | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.

### Advertiser Reliability
It's crucial to assess the reliability of advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Key indicators include:
*   **Order History**: The number of orders an advertiser has placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Completion Percentage**: The percentage of completed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. It is recommended to trade with users who have a high completion percentage, ideally above 95%, to avoid potential issues with operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

Advertisers also list their transaction limits (minimum and maximum dollars accepted) and the amount of USDT they have available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Initiating a Sale
To sell your USDT, click the "Sell USDT" button next to your chosen advertiser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. You will specify the amount of USDT you wish to sell and the corresponding USD amount you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

Important considerations during the sale:
*   **Time Limit**: Transactions typically have a payment time limit, e.g., 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Commissions**: The buyer may handle PayPal shipping commissions, which can be a percentage plus a fixed fee (e.g., 54% plus 0.3 USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. For general [[methods_to_reduce_binance_commissions | methods to reduce Binance commissions]] on transactions and withdrawals, using a recommended referral link can provide a 10% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Setting Up Payment Methods
Before initiating a sale, ensure your payment method is attached to your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This can be done by:
1.  Going to "Payment Method" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
2.  Adding a payment method, such as a bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
3.  Verifying the selected payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

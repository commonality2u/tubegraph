This tutorial explains how to [[blocking_and_unlocking_keyboards_on_windows | block and unlock your computer's keyboard]] on Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The methods described are also applicable to Windows 7 and Windows 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This can be particularly helpful if your keyboard has been locked by accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Understanding Keyboard Locking (Filter Keys)

A common way for keyboards to become inadvertently locked is through the activation of the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This feature, when enabled, blocks keyboard input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### How Filter Keys Can Be Activated

The [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] feature can be activated by holding down the **Shift** key for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The Shift key is typically found below the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

Upon holding the Shift key for this duration, your computer will sound, and a screen will emerge asking if you want to turn on the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] of Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. By default, the "Yes" option often appears, and users may unintentionally press it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If "Yes" is selected, the keyboard will cease to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## How to Unlock Your Keyboard

If your keyboard has become locked due to the activation of [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]], you can unlock it using the same method:

1.  **Locate the Shift Key:** Find the Shift key on your keyboard, typically positioned below the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Hold Down Shift:** Press and hold this Shift key for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
3.  **Confirm Activation:** Your computer should make a sound, indicating the keyboard is now active again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. You should now be able to type freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

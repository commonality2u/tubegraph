This tutorial provides methods to [[increasing_microphone_volume_in_windows_10 | increase the volume]] of a microphone on a computer or laptop, which can facilitate subsequent editing, direct streaming, or general listening clarity for subscribers and listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Method 1: Adjusting via Windows Sound Settings

The first method involves directly accessing the [[accessing_sound_settings_on_windows_10 | sound settings]] within [[Increasing microphone volume in Windows 10 | Windows 10]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Steps to Access and Adjust:
1.  **Open Sound Settings**: Go to the Start taskbar and type "sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Select "Sound settings" from the search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Input**: In the sound settings, go to the "Input" section, not "Output" (which is for speakers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
3.  **Select Microphone**: Ensure the desired microphone is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The audio volume should increase as you speak if the correct microphone is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
4.  **Access Device Properties**: Click on "Device properties" for the selected microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Volume**: The microphone volume can be set up to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This represents the maximum volume the microphone can capture without reducing [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | sound quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Quality Note**: Increasing the volume beyond this point might decrease sound quality considerably, while lowering it keeps it within the allowed quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
6.  **Alternative for Older Windows 10**: If a different window appears (common in some [[Increasing microphone volume in Windows 10 | Windows 10]] setups), navigate to the "Levels" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Here, the microphone level can also be set to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Apply the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Method 2: Adjusting via Third-Party Software

This method involves using [[using_thirdparty_software_for_audio_enhancement | third-party software]] to gain more control over audio recording and levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The tutorial refers to a program possibly named "BSR" or "abs raw" which facilitates recording videos at desired volumes and potentially converting them to audio formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Steps to Adjust (using BSR/OBS as an example):
1.  **Access Microphone Settings**: Within the software, go to the "microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Select Microphone**: Click on "settings," then "properties," and choose the microphone you wish to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  **Open Audio Mixer**: Go to the "audio mixer" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  **Access Advanced Audio Properties**: Right-click within the audio mixer window and select "Advanced audio properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This will display different microphones or audio sources interacting in the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Decibel Levels**:
    *   Locate the active microphone (e.g., "electro phone" or the one currently recording) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   The standard volume is often 0.0 decibels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   To [[increasing_microphone_volume_in_windows_10 | increase the volume]], adjust the slider; the volume will rise progressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

    > [!caution] Volume vs. Quality
    > Increasing the volume using this technique might increase the volume but can degrade the [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | quality]] of the audio, making it sound slightly worse though louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This trade-off should be kept in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Both methods are useful for raising microphone volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

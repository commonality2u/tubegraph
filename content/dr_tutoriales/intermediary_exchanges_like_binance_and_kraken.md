Withdrawing capital from the MetaMask platform to a bank account requires an intermediary centralized exchange [00:01:08]. A direct withdrawal from MetaMask to a bank account is not possible [00:01:16].

## The Role of Intermediary Exchanges

A centralized exchange acts as a crucial go-between for transferring funds from MetaMask to a traditional bank account [00:01:22]. These exchanges facilitate the conversion of cryptocurrency into fiat money and enable withdrawals to a bank account [00:01:14].

Examples of suitable centralized exchanges include:
*   [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_platforms | Coinbase]] [00:01:32]
*   [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] [00:01:32]
*   Q Coin [00:01:33]
*   [[using_kraken_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | Kraken]] [00:01:35]
*   Crypto.com [00:01:35]

It is important that the chosen [[using_centralized_exchanges_for_crypto_withdrawals | centralized exchange]] allows SEPA transfers from its platform to your bank account [00:01:41].

### Cost Comparison for Withdrawals
While [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] allows SEPA transfers, it may charge a fee (e.g., one euro) for withdrawals to a bank account [00:01:50]. In contrast, [[using_kraken_for_usdt_to_usd_conversion | Kraken]] or [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_platforms | Coinbase]] typically offer free withdrawals [00:01:54].

*Referral links for creating accounts on these platforms, which may offer bonuses (e.g., 10-15% discount on commissions), are often provided in the first comment of related video tutorials [00:02:06].*

## Supported Bank Accounts for Withdrawals

Not all conventional bank accounts accept withdrawals from [[using_centralized_exchanges_for_crypto_withdrawals | centralized exchanges]] [00:02:37]. Many traditional banks, such as Santander or BBVA, may block these withdrawals, causing the funds to return to the exchange [00:02:46].

For successful withdrawals, it is recommended to use "neobanks" like Revolut or N26 [00:02:57]. These digital banks are designed to handle transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges [00:03:00].

## The Withdrawal Process: Step-by-Step

The withdrawal process involves two main stages:
1.  [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms | Transferring cryptocurrencies between platforms | Transferring]] from MetaMask to the chosen [[using_centralized_exchanges_for_crypto_withdrawals | centralized exchange]] [00:02:26].
2.  Withdrawing from the exchange to your bank account [00:02:29].

### Stage 1: Transferring from MetaMask to Binance

This tutorial primarily focuses on transferring from MetaMask to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] using a mobile device [00:01:00].

1.  **Open MetaMask and Identify Cryptocurrency**: Open the MetaMask app and identify the cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) and the blockchain it is on (e.g., BNB Smart Chain) [00:03:40]. Ensure you have a small amount of the blockchain's native token (e.g., BNV for BNB Smart Chain) to cover gas fees [00:03:52].
2.  **Obtain Deposit Address from Binance**:
    *   Open the [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] app [00:04:05].
    *   Go to "Wallets" [00:04:07].
    *   Select "Spot" [00:04:09].
    *   Tap "Deposit" [00:04:10].
    *   Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., USDT) [00:04:14].
    *   Select the correct network (e.g., BNV Smart Chain) that matches where your cryptocurrency is hosted on MetaMask [00:04:21].
    *   Copy the displayed wallet address [00:04:28].
3.  **Send Funds from MetaMask**:
    *   Return to MetaMask [00:04:29].
    *   Select the cryptocurrency you want to send (e.g., USDT) [00:04:42].
    *   Tap "Send" [00:04:32].
    *   Paste the copied [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] wallet address [00:04:32].
    *   Enter the amount to send [00:04:44].
    *   Review the gas fee, which will be deducted from your BNV balance [00:04:52].
    *   Confirm the transaction [00:05:00].
4.  **Confirm Transfer**: The transaction will be sent and awaiting confirmation [00:05:03]. Once confirmed (typically quickly), the balance will disappear from MetaMask [00:05:10]. You can verify the transaction history in MetaMask's "Activity" section [00:05:29]. The deposit will then be reflected in your [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] account [00:05:38].

### Stage 2: Withdrawing from Binance to Bank Account

Once your capital is on the [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] platform, the next step is to send it to your bank account [00:05:51].

1.  **Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat**:
    *   Within the [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | Binance]] platform, navigate to "Trading Markets" [00:06:28].
    *   Select "Convert" [00:06:32].
    *   Convert your cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) into fiat money (e.g., Euro) [00:06:39].
    *   Review the conversion details; there are usually no commissions for this conversion [00:06:52].
    *   Execute the conversion [00:06:57].
2.  **Initiate Fiat Withdrawal**:
    *   Go to "Wallet" [00:07:03].
    *   Select "Spot" [00:07:04].
    *   Tap "Remove" (Withdraw) [00:07:07].
    *   Crucially, select "Withdraw Fiat" [00:07:14], not "Cryptocurrency withdrawal."
3.  **Choose Withdrawal Method**:
    *   **Bank Transfer (SEPA)**: This method typically charges a minimal fee (e.g., one euro) [00:07:25]. You can select your desired currency (e.g., Euro, Australian dollar, Russian rubles, Uruguayan peso) [00:07:30].
    *   **Bank Card**: This method may incur a higher commission (e.g., 1.8%) [00:07:38].
4.  **Confirm Bank Account**: Reconfirm that the bank account you are using for the withdrawal is compatible with [[using_centralized_exchanges_for_crypto_withdrawals | centralized exchanges]] [00:07:44]. Again, neobanks like Revolut or N26 are highly recommended [00:07:47].

Quizizz is an online tool designed to facilitate didactic tests with students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Teachers can utilize its features to track student performance and promote engagement.

## Registering as a Teacher
To design tests and share them with students, teachers must register as a teacher on Quizizz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This can be done using a Google email or other email accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Tracking Student Performance with Reports
Quizizz provides a "Reports" section that displays information on students who have completed tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This feature helps teachers:
*   Keep track of student grades and qualifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Identify areas where students need reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Determine where to encourage students to improve their scores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Promoting Student Engagement
Quizizz incorporates several elements to enhance student engagement during tests:

### Classes and Notifications
*   The "Classes" section allows teachers to manage groups of students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Students can connect to a class through Google Classroom or a simple link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   This connection enables students to receive real-time notifications about different questionnaires, keeping them engaged and connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Visual Appeal and Memes
*   Teachers can add images to quizzes to make them more appealing and attractive to students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Quizizz uses memes by default to make tests less serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These memes appear at the beginning, during, or at the end of tests to help students relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This contributes to better test performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Sharing Quizzes with Students
Quizzes can be shared with students in several ways:
*   **Assigned Tests:** Teachers can assign a test to a class for a future date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Students in the configured class will receive the assignment at the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Practice Link:** Teachers can generate a practice link that students can copy and paste to access and complete the test at their convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

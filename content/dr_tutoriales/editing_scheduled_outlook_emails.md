To edit an email that has already been scheduled for delivery in Outlook, follow these steps:

## How to Edit a Scheduled Email
Once an email has been scheduled, its delivery date and time can be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

1.  **Locate the Scheduled Email**: Scheduled emails can be found in the "Outbox" or "Drafts" section of your mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Navigate to the part of your mail where scheduled messages appear, typically on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Click on the scheduled email to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Access Delay Delivery Options**: With the email open, go to the "Options" section and select "Delay Delivery" or "Delay Shipment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. This window is where you can program the specific time and day for delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
3.  **Modify Delivery Date/Time**: In the "Delivery before" section, you can change the date and time the email is set to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. For example, if it was set for the 18th, you can change it to the 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
4.  **Update the Schedule**: After selecting the new date and time, click "Close" in the delay delivery options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. Then, click "Send" to update the email's [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduling_emails_in_outlook | schedule]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This action ensures the new delivery time is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

## Important Considerations
*   **Outlook Must Be Open**: For a scheduled email to be sent, Outlook must be open on your computer at the time of the scheduled delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. If Outlook is not open, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This is considered a weak point of Outlook's scheduling feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Expiration Option**: You can also set an expiration date for the scheduled email. If Outlook is not opened before this expiration date, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This option provides a safeguard for unsent emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

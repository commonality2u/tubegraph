This article provides a tutorial on how to apply [[applying_superscript_formatting | superindices]] (superscripts) and [[applying_subscript_formatting | subindices]] (subscripts) in Microsoft Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Applying Superindices and Subindices in Cells

Traditionally, indices and subindices in Excel might be represented by arrows indicating their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, Excel offers a dedicated formatting option.

To apply [[applying_superscript_formatting | superscript formatting]] or [[applying_subscript_formatting | subscript formatting]] to numbers or text within a cell:
1.  Select the specific number or character you wish to format within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  Access the "Format Cells" dialog box, typically by clicking a small arrow icon associated with font settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  Within the dialog, choose either "Superscript" for a [[applying_superscript_formatting | superindex]] or "Subscript" for a [[applying_subscript_formatting | subindex]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   For example, to make a '3' a superscript, select '3', choose "Superscript," and it will appear above the baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   To make a '3' a subscript, select '3', choose "Subscript," and it will appear below the baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Appearance in Cells vs. Formula Bar
While the formatted [[subindices_in_excel | index]] will appear above (for superindices) or below (for subindices) the baseline in the cell itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, it might appear differently in the formula bar (the "rule") where the text is displayed linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Applying Indices in Graphs

[[excel_graph_formatting | Excel graph formatting]] also supports the application of superindices and subindices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. For instance, in a density graph where a '3' might represent a power, it can be formatted as a superscript directly on the graph's labels or titles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The process is similar to applying it in a cell: select the number or character and apply the "Superscript" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

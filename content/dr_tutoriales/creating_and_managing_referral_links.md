Welcome to this tutorial on understanding and utilizing referral programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This article focuses on how to [[Binance referral program | affiliate people]] using your unique link, the benefits for both parties, and how to [[tracking_and_analyzing_referral_activities | track and manage]] your referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Benefits of Referral Links

Referral links offer advantages to both the person sharing the link (referrer) and the person using it (referee):
*   **For the Referee**: By using a referral link to [[paypal_account_setup_with_referral_links | create an account]], you can receive a 10% discount on commissions incurred during deposits, trading operations, or capital withdrawals within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This means a portion of the fees you would normally pay are returned to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **For the Referrer**: You can earn up to a 40% commission each time your referred friends conduct trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example, if you use a link where you receive 10% and the referred person receives 10%, you would receive 10% of the commissions from their transactions, and they would receive 10% off their commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Accessing the Referral Program

To access the referral program section, navigate to your profile on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Hover your mouse over your profile, and you will find a "Referral Program" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Detailed rules for the referral program are also available and recommended for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Referral Program Dashboard
The referral program interface typically includes several key sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
*   **Control Panel**: Provides an overview of your earnings and referral statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **List of Links**: Displays all your generated referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Friends List**: Shows a list of users who have registered using your links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **History of Commissions**: Details the commissions you have earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Shared Commissions**: Reflects the discounts your referred users have received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Creating and Managing Referral Links

You can generate multiple referral links, each with different commission sharing percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Generating a New Link
To [[methods_for_obtaining_amazon_affiliate_links | generate a new link]], navigate to the "generate a link" option within the referral program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Here, you can choose how much commission percentage each party receives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
*   You can select for the referred person to receive 0%, 5%, or 10% of their commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   The default referral link often provides a 10% discount for the user and earns 10% commission for the referrer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Adjusting Commission Percentages
Higher commission percentages for the referrer are possible under certain conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, if your account balance exceeds 500 BNB, you may be able to choose to receive 15% or 20% commission for yourself, while the referred person receives 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. It's recommended to choose links that best benefit the people you refer to encourage usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Tracking and Analyzing Referral Activities

### Referral Statistics
The control panel provides an overview of your referral activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This includes:
*   Total bitcoins earned from referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   Total transactions made by referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   The total number of referrals you have accrued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Friends List
The "Friends List" section displays the users who have opened accounts using your referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. While it maintains user privacy by not showing names, it displays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>:
*   User IDs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   Account type (e.g., spot, mining, futures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   Registration time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Whether they have performed operations and where (e.g., spot trading) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Commission History
The "History of Commissions" allows you to view detailed [[referral_commissions_and_benefits | earnings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. You can filter this history by account type (e.g., spot, futures, mining) to see which operations generated commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

> [!INFO] Commission Currency
> When a referred person makes a transaction, your commission will be earned in the *same cryptocurrency* they purchased or traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For example, if a referred user buys BNB, you will receive your commission in BNB, not Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This allows you to accumulate various cryptocurrencies based on your referrals' activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Mobile Access

You can also access and manage your referral program from the mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Simply open the app, navigate to your profile (usually an icon in the top left), and select the "Referral Program" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The mobile interface provides a similar menu to the desktop version, showing your friends who have used your links and their transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

When [[withdrawing_cryptocurrency_funds_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing capital]] from cryptocurrency platforms like MetaMask to a bank account, it's crucial to follow a safe and reliable process, which often involves an intermediary centralized exchange before reaching the bank account directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This means a direct withdrawal from MetaMask to a bank account is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Need for Compatible Bank Accounts
It's important to understand that the [[choosing_a_compatible_bank_for_withdrawals_from_exchanges | bank account used for withdrawals]] must be a specific type, as not all conventional banks accept withdrawals from centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Traditional banks, such as Santander or BBVA, may block these withdrawals, causing the funds to be returned to the centralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

## Recommended Neobanks: Revolut and N26
For successful cryptocurrency withdrawals, [[using_bank_accounts_compatible_with_cryptocurrency_exchanges | neobanks like Revolut or N26 are recommended]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. These "super neobanks" are highly compatible with various cryptocurrency exchanges and allow transactions that conventional banks might restrict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Benefits and Usage

The use of these neobanks is recommended by the speaker for their reliability in handling cryptocurrency withdrawals from centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. These accounts also come with [[the_benefits_of_n26_for_international_transactions | associated benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## The Withdrawal Process
The general process involves transferring funds from MetaMask to a centralized exchange (e.g., Binance, [[using_thirdparty_platforms_like_kraken_for_crypto_withdrawals | Kraken]], [[using_thirdparty_platforms_like_kraken_for_crypto_withdrawals | Coinbase]]) and then from the exchange to the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The chosen centralized exchange must support SEPA Transfers from its platform to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

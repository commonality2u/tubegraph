Outlook provides a feature to [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | schedule emails]] for future delivery, allowing users to control exactly when a message is sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## How to Schedule an Email in Outlook

To begin [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduling an email]]:
1.  Open Outlook and navigate to the mail section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  Click on "New email" to compose a new message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
3.  Fill in the recipient, subject, and body of the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   *Note: If you're interested in refining your email with professional closes, learn about [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | creating and modifying signatures in Outlook]] in a separate tutorial* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
4.  Once the email content is ready, go to the "Options" tab within the new email window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
5.  Select "Delay shipment" (or "Delay Delivery" depending on your Outlook version) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
6.  In the "Delivery options" section, check the "Do not deliver before" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
7.  Choose the specific date and time you want the email to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. For example, you can set it to arrive on the 18th of the month at 3:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
8.  Click "Close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
9.  Finally, click "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The email will not be sent immediately but will be held in your Outbox until the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Requirements for Scheduled Email Delivery

It is critical to understand the [[requirements_for_sending_scheduled_emails_in_outlook | requirements for sending scheduled emails in Outlook]]:
*   The scheduled email will *only* be sent if your computer is on and the Outlook application is open at the exact scheduled delivery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   If Outlook is not open at the scheduled time, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   This is considered a [[limitations_of_scheduling_emails_in_outlook | weak point]] of Outlook's scheduling feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Expiration Option

Within the "Delay Delivery" window, you can also find an "Expires" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This feature allows you to set an expiration date for the scheduled email. If, for instance, you've scheduled an email for tomorrow at 5:00 PM, but Outlook isn't open at that time, you can set an expiration date beyond which the email should no longer be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Managing Scheduled Emails

To view your scheduled emails, go to the "Messages part" on the right side of your Outlook interface, specifically the Outbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Here, you will see a count of your pending scheduled messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Editing Scheduled Emails

You can [[editing_scheduled_outlook_emails | edit the delivery time]] of a scheduled email before it's sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>:
1.  Open the scheduled email from your Outbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  Go to "Options" and then "Delay delivery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
3.  Adjust the "Do not deliver before" date and time to your desired new schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For example, you can change it from the 18th to the 19th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
4.  Click "Close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
5.  Click "Send" to update the schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The email will now be sent on the new scheduled date and time, provided Outlook is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

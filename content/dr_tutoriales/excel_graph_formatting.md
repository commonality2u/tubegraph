This article explains how to apply superindices (superscripts) and subindices (subscripts) to numerical values within an Excel document, which can be particularly useful for labels or values displayed in graphs. The process involves using the format cell options to modify text appearance.

## Applying Superindices (Superscripts)
Traditionally, superindices might be indicated with an upward arrow next to the number, but Excel offers a direct formatting option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

To apply a superindex:
1.  Select the specific number or character you wish to format as a superindex within a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
2.  Access the "Format Cells" dialog box. This is typically done by right-clicking the cell and selecting "Format Cells," or by clicking the small arrow in the "Font" group on the "Home" tab of the Excel ribbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
3.  Within the "Format Cells" dialog, navigate to the "Font" tab.
4.  Check the box next to "Superscript" (or "Superindex" in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
5.  Click "OK".

While the formatted number will appear as a superindex in the cell (e.g., above the baseline) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, it will still display as a regular character in the formula bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This formatting can be applied to numbers that represent densities or other values within [[superindices_in_excel | Superindices in Excel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.

## Applying Subindices (Subscripts)
Similar to superindices, Excel provides a direct formatting option for subindices.

To apply a subindex:
1.  Select the specific number or character you wish to format as a subindex within a cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
2.  Access the "Format Cells" dialog box (as described for superscripts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
3.  Within the "Format Cells" dialog, navigate to the "Font" tab.
4.  Check the box next to "Subscript" (or "Subindex" in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
5.  Click "OK".

The formatted number will appear below the baseline in the cell, clearly visible as a subscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This method demonstrates the functionality for [[subindices_in_excel | Subindices in Excel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

It is often preferred over other exchanges like [[using_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_for_transactions | Coinbase]] for withdrawals due to lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

To deposit cryptocurrency, such as Ethereum, into your Kraken account:

1.  **Navigate to Kraken**: Access the Kraken platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:52">[01:14:52]</a>.
2.  **Select Cryptocurrency**: Go to the portfolio section and choose the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit, for example, Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Deposit**: Select the "Deposit" option for that cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:20">[01:24:20]</a>.
4.  **Understand Blockchain**: The deposit will typically occur via its native blockchain, such as the Ethereum blockchain for Ethereum, which hosts the cryptocurrency in wallets like [[using_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_for_transactions | Coinbase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>. The estimated deposit time can vary, for example, approximately 14 minutes for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.
5.  **Copy Deposit Address**: Copy the unique deposit address provided by Kraken for your chosen cryptocurrency.
6.  **Transfer from Source Wallet**: Go to your source wallet (e.g., [[using_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_for_transactions | Coinbase]]) and paste the copied Kraken deposit address into the send field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:29">[02:18:29]</a>.
7.  **Confirm Network**: Ensure that the suggested network for the transaction is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
8.  **Review and Confirm**: Review the transaction details, including commissions (e.g., 7.55 to 6.52 USD for certain transactions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:09">[02:28:09]</a>, and then confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:12">[02:37:12]</a>.
9.  **Transaction Execution**: The transaction will be executed, and the funds will appear in your Kraken account once confirmed on the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:06">[02:39:06]</a>. The Ethereum will then be visible within your Kraken account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:54">[03:07:54]</a>.

This article details a method for [[removing_filmora_10_watermark | removing the Filmora 10 watermark]] from edited videos by recording the screen, rather than using Filmora 10's built-in export function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Watermark Problem

When [[removing_filmora_10_watermark | Filmora 10]] videos are exported directly, a watermark appears on the saved file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This can be problematic for content creators who wish to publish their work without the editor's branding.

## Solution: Using OBS Studio to Record Screen

The proposed solution involves using a screen recording program called OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This program records the computer screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, effectively allowing you to capture the edited video playing in Filmora 10 without the watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Steps to Export Without Watermark

1.  **Prepare Video in Filmora 10:**
    *   Import the video you wish to edit into Filmora 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
    *   Edit the video as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Ensure the video preview in Filmora 10 is clearly visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

2.  **Download and Open OBS Studio:**
    *   Download and install OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Open OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

3.  **Configure OBS Studio for Recording:**
    *   Minimize OBS Studio or move it to a second screen if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   Keep Filmora 10 open on the screen you intend to record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   In OBS Studio, select the screen where Filmora 10 is displayed as the recording source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Maximize the Filmora 10 video preview window to fill the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

4.  **Record the Video:**
    *   Click "Start Recording" in OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   Play your edited video within Filmora 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   OBS Studio will record both the screen and the audio from Filmora 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

This method allows you to save your edited video as a file recorded by OBS Studio, bypassing the Filmora 10 export function and thus avoiding the watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

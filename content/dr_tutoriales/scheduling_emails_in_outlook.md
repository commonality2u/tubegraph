## How to Schedule an Email

1.  **Open Outlook and Compose a New Email**
    Begin by opening Outlook and navigating to the mail section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Click on "New email" (or "New mail") located on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Draft Your Email**
    Fill in the recipient, subject, and body of your email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
    *   *Note:* If you're interested in setting up [[configuring_signatures_for_different_email_accounts_in_outlook | powerful signatures]] in Outlook, a separate tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Access Delay Delivery Options**
    Once your email is written, go to the "Options" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. Here, select "[[delaying_email_delivery_in_outlook | Delay shipment]]" (or "Delay Delivery") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Set Delivery Date and Time**
    In the delay delivery window, pay special attention to the "Delivery before" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This allows you to program the email to be sent at a specific time and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. Choose your desired day and time for the email to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. For example, you can set it to arrive on the 18th at 3 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
5.  **Set Email Expiration (Optional)**
    Within the same options, you can also set an expiration date for the shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. This means if Outlook isn't opened by a certain date, the scheduled email can expire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
6.  **Confirm and Send**
    After configuring your delivery settings, click "Close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. Then, click the "Send" button as you normally would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The email will not be sent immediately but will be held until the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Scheduled Emails

*   **Outlook Must Be Open:** It is crucial to understand that a [[important_considerations_for_scheduled_emails | scheduled shipment of mail]] will only be sent if your computer is on and the Outlook application is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. If Outlook is not running at the scheduled delivery time, your email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This is a current limitation of Outlook that needs to be acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Viewing and Updating Scheduled Emails

Scheduled emails are typically found in your "Outbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. If you click on the Outbox, you will see the scheduled mail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

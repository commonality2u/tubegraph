Outlook allows users to schedule emails to be sent at a specific date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This feature enables you to prepare emails in advance and ensure they are delivered precisely when needed.

## How to Schedule an Email

To schedule an email for later delivery:
1.  Open your Outlook application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Mail" section and click on "New Email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
3.  Compose your email, filling in the recipient(s), subject, and body text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    *   *Note:* If you are interested in creating or modifying your email [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | signatures]], a separate tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
4.  Once the email is written, navigate to the "Options" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
5.  Click on "Delay Shipment" (or "Delay Delivery" in English versions of Outlook) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
6.  In the "Properties" window, pay special attention to the "Delivery options" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
7.  Check the "Do not deliver before" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
8.  Choose the desired date and time for the email to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, you can program it for the 18th at 3:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
9.  Click "Close" to confirm the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
10. Click "Send" on the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The email will not be sent immediately but will be held for the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Managing Scheduled Emails

After sending, the email will not appear in your "Sent Items" folder immediately. Instead, it will be visible in the "Outbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   To view scheduled emails, navigate to your "Outbox" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   You can open the scheduled email from the "Outbox" to [[editing_scheduled_outlook_emails | edit its delivery time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Open the email, go to "Options," then "Delay Delivery," adjust the date/time, and click "Close," followed by "Send" again to update the schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Scheduled Emails

> [!important] Outlook Must Be Open
> A critical [[requirements_for_sending_scheduled_emails_in_outlook | requirement for sending scheduled emails]] in Outlook is that the Outlook application must be open and the computer turned on at the exact scheduled delivery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. If Outlook is not open, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This is a recognized [[limitations_of_scheduling_emails_in_outlook | weak point of Outlook]] that some believe should be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Expiration Setting
Within the "Delay Delivery" options, there is an "Expires" setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This allows you to set an expiration date for the scheduled email. If Outlook is not open by the scheduled time, and the expiration date passes, the scheduled delivery will be cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

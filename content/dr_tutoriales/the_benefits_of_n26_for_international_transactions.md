[[introduction_to_n26_bank_and_its_features | N26]] is a bank that stands out for not charging commissions on domestic or international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This feature addresses common problems encountered with many traditional banks when performing such transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Solving International Transfer Challenges
For users in Spain, for example, traditional banks often pose problems when making transfers to the UK or USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. [[introduction_to_n26_bank_and_its_features | N26]] is recommended as a solution for these types of transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The bank can be used to perform international transactions entirely free of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## N26 as an Intermediary
One effective strategy for international transactions is to use [[introduction_to_n26_bank_and_its_features | N26]] as an intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Users can maintain their national bank account but transfer funds to [[introduction_to_n26_bank_and_its_features | N26]] first to facilitate free international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

## Features Supporting International Transfers
Within the [[navigating_the_n26_app_for_basic_operations | N26 app]], several options facilitate money transfers:
*   **Bank Transfers**: Users can send money via bank transfer, which is completely free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Foreign Currency Transfers**: The option to transfer in foreign currency is also entirely free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **QR Code**: Money can also be sent by scanning a [[using_qr_codes_and_instant_transfers_with_n26 | QR code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This system is similar to common mobile-to-mobile transfers linked to bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### N26 Standard Account Benefits
The N26 Standard account, which is a free, basic account without monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, includes "payments in commissions worldwide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. This highlights the cost-saving advantage for global transactions even with the basic account.

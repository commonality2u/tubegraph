Activating comments on YouTube videos is crucial for channel growth, as increased interaction between visitors and the content creator promotes the video more widely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Even negative comments can be beneficial, as any form of interaction helps position videos better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

To ensure comments are enabled, particularly by correctly classifying content as "not for children," there are three key considerations to address within YouTube Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Channel-Level Configuration

The first step is to adjust the overall channel settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Go to "Configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Select "Channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Under "Advanced Settings," confirm that the channel is marked as "not a channel created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If the channel is designated as "created for children," comments will be banned across all videos on the channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Video-Specific Content Setting

The second consideration involves the individual video's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
*   Navigate to the specific video in YouTube Studio and click on "Details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Within the video's details, identify the section concerning content creation for children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Select "no, it is not content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Marking content as "created for children" will cause YouTube to block all comments for that particular video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Allowing Comments within Video Options

Even if a video is not classified as "created for children," its comments can still be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This third consideration ensures comments are explicitly permitted.
*   Within the video's details, find "More options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Scroll down to the "Comments and ratings" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Select "allow all comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Options exist to disable comments entirely or prevent them from being read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, but to encourage interaction, "allow all comments" should be chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

After activating comments, creators can review notifications for new comments and choose to delete those that are inappropriate or lack respect, as they can disrupt the video's dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

This tutorial demonstrates how to analyze and view the metadata, including geolocation, of photos using a free mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Using the Xif (Exif) App

To begin, you need a mobile phone and a free application called "Xif" (also referred to as "Exif") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
In the Apple Store, you can find this app by searching for "Exif, metadata" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The correct application will appear as an orange icon with "photo, video" and details like "one hundred and fifty-three reviews, four point five stars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

Once downloaded, open the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It offers a free option, which is generally sufficient, and a Pro option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The first step is to allow the app to access your photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

When viewing photos within the app, you are seeing data associated with your images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It's important to note that not all mobile phones have geolocation activated by default when taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This setting can be chosen in permissions, and instructions for [[enabling_and_disabling_photo_geolocation | enabling and disabling photo geolocation]] will be covered in future tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Therefore, some photos may have location enabled, while others do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Analyzing Photo Data

When you select a photo, the app displays various details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>:
*   Image size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Camera details (e.g., iPhone 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Lens information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Longitude and latitude, which are the coordinates based on the photo's geolocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

If geolocation is enabled for a photo, you can click on the map within the app to see the exact location where the photo was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This feature can be very precise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For example, a photo of graffiti in Bristol, England, accurately shows its location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Similarly, a photo taken at Niagara Falls accurately displays its location near the Skylon Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. However, a photo sent by someone who did not have location enabled will show no location or metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Editing and Adding Photos

The app also allows you to edit the location data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. To upload a new photo for analysis, tap the "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. You can add photos at any time and view their metadata, including location and camera details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

This article explains how to [[deactivating_airpods_notifications|deactivate notifications]] that are read aloud by [[deactivating_airpods_notifications|AirPods]] from your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing Notification Settings

To manage AirPods notifications, start by going to the "Settings" app on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Once in "Settings," locate and tap on "Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If you cannot find it, use the search bar at the top of the "Settings" menu and type "Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Inside the "Notifications" section, you will see various options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. While general notification display options (such as "Group," "List," or "Count") are visible, these primarily control how notifications from apps like WhatsApp are shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Managing Siri Announce Notifications

To control AirPods-specific announcements, look for the "Siri, Announce Notifications" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Tap on "Announce Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Here, you will find a toggle to either "Announce Notifications" or "Don't announce them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. If "Announce Notifications" is active, Siri will read notifications aloud when your headphones are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

To [[deactivating_airpods_notifications|deactivate notifications]] from being read aloud by your AirPods, simply toggle this option off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If you reactivate it, notifications will be read aloud again, and you may also have the option to respond without confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## [[selecting_specific_apps_for_siri_notification_announcements|Selecting Specific Apps for Siri Notification Announcements]]

Beneath the main announcement toggle, you can further [[customizing_siri_notifications_with_airpods|customize Siri notification settings]] by choosing which specific apps Siri will announce through your headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

For example, if you have the overall "Announce Notifications" activated but want to prevent a specific application (like "Fever") from announcing notifications, you can disable its individual announcement setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This way, even if general announcements are on, selected apps will not have their notifications read aloud through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

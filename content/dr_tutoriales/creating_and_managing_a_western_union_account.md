## Accessing the Western Union Platform

The Western Union platform can be accessed via a computer or through their mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The mobile app is noted for being very simple to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Upon accessing the platform, the default page will typically reflect your current location, such as Spain in the example provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Creating an Account

To initiate a transfer or manage services, you will need to either log in to an existing account or [[how_to_create_a_revolut_account | create a new one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. The account creation process involves setting up a profile with your name, surname, and email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

> When creating an account or making transfers, Western Union advises users to only send money to friends and family members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Do not transfer money if you have been asked to send it for reasons that may indicate fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. A phone number is available for those who suspect they are victims of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Managing Your Account Profile and Settings

Once logged in, you can access a menu at the top of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Under "My Western Union" or "My W," you can manage your profile settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Profile configurations allow you to:
*   Update your banking data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Change your original name and country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Manage email notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   Save recipients for future transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## Initiating and Tracking Transfers

After account creation, you can proceed with a transfer. This involves inputting the recipient's data, including their bank account details if sending to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. You'll also need to specify the purpose of the transaction, the origin of the money, and your relationship with the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

The platform allows you to review the entire transfer, including all associated [[calculating_transfer_fees_and_exchange_rates_with_western_union | commissions and data]] before confirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Once confirmed, you receive a receipt and can [[how_to_send_money_via_western_union_in_2025 | track the transfer]] using a serial number provided for each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Most transfers typically do not take more than one business day to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[western_union_online_vs_cash_money_transfers | Online vs. Cash Money Transfers]]
> Western Union allows for money to be sent online for either cash pickup or direct bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Payments for transfers made by the sender must always be online, either via bank transfer or credit/debit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Transfers paid by credit card or debit card arrive in minutes, while those to a bank account may take one business day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. It's important to note that sending money for cash pickup might involve higher effective commissions, as indicated by a reduced amount received by the recipient compared to bank account transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.

## My Western Union Loyalty Program

Western Union offers a loyalty program called "My Western Union" or "My W" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. By making transfers, you can earn points that provide benefits, including reduced commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. To access these benefits, you need a "My Western Union number," which is provided upon account verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Referral Program

The platform also features a referral program where you can recommend Western Union to friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. If a friend opens an account using your referral link, they can receive an electronic gift code, such as up to $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. A common requirement for the referral bonus is that the new user must send at least $100 within 30 days of creating their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

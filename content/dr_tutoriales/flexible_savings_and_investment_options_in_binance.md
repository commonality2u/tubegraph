Binance offers various financial products to generate returns from cryptocurrency holdings, notably the BNB Vault. This feature allows users to invest their BNB (Binance Coin) to earn profits in other cryptocurrencies. It is found within the "Earn" or "Finance" section of the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## BNB Vault Overview
The BNB Vault is a financial product exclusively for investing BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Unlike some other investment options on Binance, it does not support cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The core concept of the BNB Vault is to "stake" BNB to produce other cryptocurrencies as rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Key Features
*   **Automatic Transfer**: Users can enable an automatic transfer feature that moves available BNB balances from their spot account directly into the BNB Vault every day at 1:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This feature can be activated or deactivated as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Flexible Savings**: BNB invested in the Vault is considered [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This means users can withdraw their BNB at any time without being subject to [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked staking]] periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Multiple Rewards**: Investing in the BNB Vault provides multiple types of rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   **Launchpool Rewards**: The BNB Vault integrates with Binance's Launchpool, providing users with rewards from new projects launched on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. For example, it allows earning cryptocurrencies like LIT and AXS from their respective Launchpools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Savings Rewards**: In addition to Launchpool earnings, users also receive rewards specifically from the savings component of the Vault, effectively re-investing to earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   **Random Rewards**: Binance periodically releases programs that offer random rewards and other cryptocurrencies to BNB Vault participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Comparison with Launchpool
While users can directly invest BNB in the Launchpool to earn new cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, the BNB Vault offers a more comprehensive benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. If BNB is invested directly in the Launchpool, only the cryptocurrencies offered by that specific Launchpool system are obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. However, by investing BNB in the BNB Vault, users gain rewards from the Launchpool *and* additional savings rewards, leading to more overall cryptocurrency benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Getting Started with Binance Investments
For those looking to get started, it is recommended to review how to invest cryptocurrencies on Binance based on individual risk acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. New users can create a Binance account using a referral link to receive a 10% discount on commissions, which applies to deposits, transactions, and withdrawals on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This can help with [[methods_for_reducing_deposit_fees_on_binance | reducing deposit fees]] and general [[using_discounts_on_binance_to_save_on_transaction_fees | transaction fees]] using [[using_referrals_and_discounts_on_binance | referrals and discounts on Binance]].

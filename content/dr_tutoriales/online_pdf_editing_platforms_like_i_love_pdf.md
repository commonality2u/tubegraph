Separating pages from a PDF document is a common task, and there are several effective methods available, including using built-in browser functionalities and dedicated online platforms like [[using_i_love_pdf_to_join_pdfs | I Love PDF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This guide outlines two methodologies for achieving this, requiring no external programs or software installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Method 1: Separating PDF Pages Using Google Chrome

This method leverages Google Chrome's built-in printing functionality to extract specific pages from a PDF without needing additional software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Steps:

1.  **Open the PDF in Google Chrome**: Locate your PDF file on your computer's desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Instead of opening it with Adobe Acrobat, right-click the file and select "Open with" and then "Google Chrome" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The PDF will open in a new tab within the browser, displaying its pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  **Access the Print Dialogue**: Click the "Printer" button, typically found at the top of the browser interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
3.  **Select Custom Pages**: In the print options, locate the "Pages" setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Change the selection from "All" to "Custom" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
4.  **Specify Desired Pages**: Enter the page numbers you wish to extract. For example, to select pages three and four from an eight-page PDF, type "3,4" into the custom pages field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
5.  **Save the New PDF**: Click "Print" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. You will then be prompted to choose a location to save the new PDF, which will contain only the selected pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The resulting file will contain only the specified pages, such as page three and four in the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

This method is straightforward and does not require external software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

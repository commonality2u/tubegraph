Google Chrome allows users to manage pop-up windows, including the ability to block specific websites from sending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. This feature enables a more controlled browsing experience, ensuring that only desired sites can display pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>.

## Accessing Popup Settings

To access pop-up settings in [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]]:
1.  Open the [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]] page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:49">[00:50:49]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "configuration" part, located at the top right of the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.
3.  Click on "advanced settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
4.  Once in advanced settings, you can either:
    *   Use the search bar, labeled "search settings," and type "emerging" (referring to pop-ups), which will bring up the "site configuration" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:14">[01:19:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, go to the "privacy and security" section on the left, then click on "site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:13">[01:30:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

Within "site configuration," locate the option for "windows emerging redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:46">[01:35:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>.

## Blocking Specific Sites

While in the "windows emerging redirects" section, users can configure which sites are allowed or blocked from sending pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>:
1.  You will see an option that indicates whether sites are allowed to send pop-up windows or use redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.
2.  To block specific sites, you can add them to a block list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
3.  For example, to prevent YouTube from sending pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>:
    *   Click "add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:35">[02:15:35]</a>.
    *   Enter the website address, such as `www.youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:34">[02:17:34]</a>.
    *   Click "add" to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.
    *   After this, YouTube will no longer send pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>.

This method allows users to customize their pop-up preferences by enabling pop-ups for all pages, disabling them for all pages, or activating them only for a select few while blocking others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:46">[02:35:46]</a>.

MEGA is a web page primarily used for sharing and downloading content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It facilitates the process where one user uploads files and another user downloads them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. People commonly use MEGA to share and download various types of files, such as series, movies, and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[creating_a_mega_account | Creating a MEGA Account]]

To [[creating_a_mega_account | create a MEGA account]], you simply need to enter an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After providing your email, you will receive a confirmation email that you need to confirm to finalize the account creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Account Plans and Storage

Once your account is created, MEGA presents various plans for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The free plan offers up to 50 gigabytes (GB) of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. While this is considered somewhat limited, it is generally sufficient for storing small or relatively small files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For users requiring more storage, there are paid options such as Lite and Pro accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## [[uploading_files_to_mega | Uploading Files to MEGA]]

To [[uploading_files_to_mega | upload files to MEGA]], navigate to the cloud symbol within your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. From there, you can choose to upload new folders or individual files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | Compressing Files with WinRAR for MEGA]]

To optimize storage space on your MEGA account, especially with the 50 GB limit of the free plan, it is advisable to [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compress files]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. WinRAR is a program commonly used for file compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

**Steps to compress files with WinRAR:**
1.  Right-click on the file or folder you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  Click "Add file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  In the WinRAR window, ensure the file format is set to "Rar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
4.  Set the compression method to "Best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
5.  Select "Create a solid file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
6.  Click "Accept" to start the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

For example, a folder weighing 2.21 GB initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> can be reduced significantly through compression. After compression, the same file can weigh 1.31 GB, representing a compression of approximately 8-9 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Once compressed, you can then proceed to [[uploading_files_to_mega | upload the compressed file]] to MEGA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## [[managing_and_sharing_mega_links | Managing and Sharing MEGA Links]]

Once a file has been [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploaded to MEGA]], you can share it with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

**Steps to [[managing_and_sharing_mega_links | manage and share links]]:**
1.  Locate the uploaded file in your MEGA cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
2.  Right-click on the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
3.  Select the "Manage link" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
4.  The generated link is a "link with key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This means the content is accessible to anyone who has the link and the corresponding decryption key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
5.  To find the decryption key, click on "cipher key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
6.  Copy the provided key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

By providing both the link and this key, others will be able to download the content you have shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

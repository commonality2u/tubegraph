When depositing capital into the [[wise_platform_tutorial | Wise platform]], various methods are available, each with its own associated commissions or fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The fee structure depends on the chosen deposit method, with some options being free and others incurring a charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Deposit Methods and Associated Fees

The [[methods_to_deposit_money_on_wise | methods to deposit money on Wise]] include debit cards, credit cards, PayPal, and bank transfers, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Debit Card / Credit Card
Depositing funds via debit or credit card incurs a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For a deposit of 200 euros, the associated commission is 0.82 euros, resulting in a total payment of 200.82 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The transaction may cost "up to 80 cents" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, and specifically, the example shows losing 82 euro cents for a quick transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Using Visa or Mastercard allows for deposits in a matter of seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### PayPal
Depositing via PayPal typically involves the same commission as using a debit or credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, or possibly "more of the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Bank Transfer
Bank transfers are a free method of depositing funds to Wise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, meaning it does not cost anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. When choosing a bank transfer, Wise provides the necessary bank details for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The user confirms they are the account holder and indicates they will perform the transfer via online banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. A specific reference associated with the shipment must be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Other Methods
Other deposit methods like "Lee" (an electronic account) and "Ideal" are also mentioned, though their specific commissions are not detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The choice of method can depend on the urgency of the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

PowerPoint presentations can be enhanced by embedding videos directly from a computer [00:00:04]. This method allows for offline playback, unlike [[adding_online_videos_to_powerpoint_presentations | online videos]] which require an internet connection [00:02:13].

## Steps to Insert a Local Video

To add a video stored on your computer to a PowerPoint presentation:
1.  Open your PowerPoint presentation [00:00:17].
2.  Navigate to the desired slide where you want to add the video, or create a new slide [00:00:30].
3.  Go to the "Insert" tab in the PowerPoint ribbon [00:00:39].
4.  In the "Insert" tab, locate and click on the "Video" option [00:00:42].
5.  From the dropdown menu, select "Video on My PC" (or "Video computer") [00:00:47].
6.  A file explorer window will appear, allowing you to browse and select the video file from your computer [00:01:50].
7.  Once the video is selected, click "Insert" [00:02:00].

## Playback and Features

After insertion, the video will be embedded directly into the slide [00:02:03]. Videos inserted from a computer offer distinct playback advantages compared to [[how_to_insert_a_video_from_youtube_into_powerpoint | YouTube videos]] or other [[adding_online_videos_to_powerpoint_presentations | online videos]]:

This contrasts with [[how_to_insert_a_video_from_youtube_into_powerpoint | YouTube videos]], which require an internet connection to play [00:01:27], [00:02:19].

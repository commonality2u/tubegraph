## Steps to Switch to the Mobile Version

To change your Facebook view to its mobile counterpart on a computer, follow these simple steps:

    Begin by ensuring you are on a Facebook video page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.
2.  **Modify the URL**
    Locate the `WWW` portion of the URL in your browser's address bar. Remove both `WWW` and `HTTP` from the URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
3.  **Insert 'M'**
    Replace the removed `WWW` and `HTTP` with a single letter `M` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This modification changes the URL to direct you to the mobile version of the site while still on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Transferring Funds from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase

4.  Click "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
5.  Choose the option to "transfer it to Coinbase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   Note the daily transfer limit (e.g., 250,000 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
6.  Select the quantity you wish to transfer (e.g., maximum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   This transfer usually has a zero-euro commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
7.  Click "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The process is instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
8.  Your funds will now be in your regular Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

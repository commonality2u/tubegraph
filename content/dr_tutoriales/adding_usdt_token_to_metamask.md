## Obtaining the USDT Contract Address

To add the USDT token, you will need its contract address:
1.  Open a new tab in your browser and navigate to a cryptocurrency listing website that provides contract details. The link to this platform will be available in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  On the website, use the search engine to look for "USDT" (Tether) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  Once found, the platform will display the USDT contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. You will need to copy this address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Adding USDT to Metamask

There are two primary methods to add the USDT token to your [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] wallet:

### Method 1: Manual Addition

1.  Open your [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] extension or application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  If the token doesn't appear automatically when you search for "USDT", select the option to "Add token" or "Import Tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  Choose to add a custom token or [[usdt_contract_address_usage | contract address token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
4.  Paste the copied USDT contract address into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
5.  [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] should automatically recognize the token symbol (USDT) and decimals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
6.  Confirm the addition, and the USDT token will appear in your [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Method 2: Automatic Addition (via "Little Fox" Icon)

This method is quicker if you have the [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] browser extension installed:
1.  On the cryptocurrency listing website where you found the USDT contract address, you will see a small fox icon (the [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] logo) next to the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  Click on this "little fox" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
3.  A [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] notification tab will open, prompting you to add the token directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
4.  Once loaded, you can confirm to add the token to your [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
5.  Refresh your [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] page, and the USDT token should now be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

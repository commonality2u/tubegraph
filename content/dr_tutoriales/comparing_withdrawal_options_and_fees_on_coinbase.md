Withdrawing funds from Coinbase involves converting cryptocurrencies to fiat money (e.g., Euros) and then transferring them to a linked bank account or other payment methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Cryptocurrencies like Polygon MATIC cannot be directly withdrawn to a bank account as they are not legal tender stored in banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The first step is to convert your cryptocurrencies to a conventional currency that can be withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

To do this, navigate to the "operating and selling" section to convert your coins to Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, to sell MATIC, search for the asset, select "sell," and confirm the conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

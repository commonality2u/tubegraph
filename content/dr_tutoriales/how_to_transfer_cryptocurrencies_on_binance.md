This guide explains how to transfer cryptocurrencies and fiat currency on the Binance platform, covering both internal transfers between different Binance wallets and external transfers to or from other platforms or bank accounts. The goal is to provide a complete overview of these processes on the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Types of Transfers on Binance

Binance allows for two main types of transfers:
1.  **Internal Transfers**: Within the Binance platform, between different wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **External Transfers**: To or from other platforms or bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These include [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | depositing]] and [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | withdrawing]] funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## Internal Transfers on Binance

Internal transfers allow users to move funds between different wallets within their Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. To perform these transfers, navigate to the "Wallet" section and select "Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Binance Wallets
Binance features various wallets designed for different purposes, including:
*   Fiat Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Margin Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Isolated Margin Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Futures Wallet (e.g., Futures Coin-M, Futures USD-M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>
*   Stock Token Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   P2P (Peer-to-Peer) Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Pool Pay Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Options Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

The **Spot Wallet** acts as a general wallet where fiat and cryptocurrencies are initially deposited and held for general use, similar to a physical pocket or wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Funds can be transferred from the Spot Wallet to other specific wallets depending on the intended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### How to Perform an Internal Transfer

1.  **Access Transfer Option**: Within the "Wallet Overview," select the "Transfer" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
2.  **Select Wallets**: Choose the 'from' wallet (e.g., Fiat and Spot) and the 'to' wallet (e.g., P2P, Futures USD-M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. An arrow icon allows you to quickly swap the 'from' and 'to' wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
3.  **Choose Currency and Amount**: Select the desired cryptocurrency (e.g., BUSD, USDT) and enter the amount to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Transfer**: Confirm the transaction. The funds will then appear in the selected destination wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The type of wallet used should align with the desired activity; for instance, transferring to a Futures wallet for futures trading or to a P2P wallet for peer-to-peer trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## External Transfers: Deposits and Withdrawals

#### Depositing Cryptocurrencies
To [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | deposit cryptocurrencies]] from an external wallet or platform (e.g., [[transferring_bitcoin_from_coinbase_to_binance | from Coinbase to Binance]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>:
1.  **Select Deposit Option**: Go to "Wallet Overview" and choose "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  **Choose Crypto**: Select "Deposit Crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
3.  **Select Cryptocurrency**: Choose the specific cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
4.  **Select Network**: This is a critical step. Choose the correct blockchain network (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20, TRC-20, etc.) that the sending platform or wallet uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
5.  **Obtain Wallet Address**: Binance will provide a unique wallet address/code for your account on the selected network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This acts as the destination address for your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
6.  **Initiate Transfer from External Platform**: Copy this address and paste it into the withdrawal section of the external platform or wallet from which you are sending the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

> ### Important Warning
> It is crucial that the blockchain network selected on Binance matches the network used by the sending platform. If the networks do not match (e.g., sending via ERC-20 but selecting TRC-20 on Binance), the cryptocurrency will be lost and will not reach your Binance wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Always confirm the network with the sender if someone is depositing funds to your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The transfer typically takes around 2-3 minutes to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

4.  **Select Network**: Similar to deposits, select the correct blockchain network that the recipient's wallet uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The network chosen can affect transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

> ### Bank Recommendations for Fiat Transfers
> Some traditional banks (e.g., Santander, Sabadell, BBVA in Spain) may block or cancel transactions related to cryptocurrency platforms, preventing the capital from reaching your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
>
> It is recommended to use banking services like N26 or Revolut for fiat deposits and withdrawals, as they are less likely to block transactions with cryptocurrency platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

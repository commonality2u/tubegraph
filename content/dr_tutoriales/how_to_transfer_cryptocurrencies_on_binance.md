## Internal Transfers within Binance

Binance offers several types of wallets within its platform, each designed for different purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. These include:
*   Fiat Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Spot Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Margin Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Margin Isolated Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Futures Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>

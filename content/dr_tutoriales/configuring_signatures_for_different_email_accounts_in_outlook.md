*   Within the signature editing area, you can:
    *   Import images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   Add text in various formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
    *   Include details like your name, company logo, email, and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Assigning Signatures to Email Accounts and Message Types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>

Outlook allows you to configure specific signatures for different scenarios:
*   **Email Account Selection:** Choose which email account the signature applies to, especially useful if you have multiple accounts configured in Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.
*   **New Messages:** Select a default signature to be used for all new emails sent from the chosen account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **[[using_signatures_for_replies_and_forwarded_emails_in_Outlook | Replies and Forwards]]:** Configure a separate signature to be used specifically for replies or forwarded emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. You can choose to use the same signature as new messages, a different one, or no signature at all for these types of communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   Once all selections are made, click "OK" to apply the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

## Verifying Signature Application

To confirm your signature settings:
*   **New Email:** Create a new email. The configured signature should appear automatically based on the selected account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Reply/Forward:** Reply to or forward an existing email. The assigned signature for replies/forwards should be visible in the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

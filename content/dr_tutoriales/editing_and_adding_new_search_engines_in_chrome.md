This guide explains how to [[managing_search_engine_settings_in_google_chrome | manage search engine settings]] within [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]], specifically focusing on how to set Google as your default search engine and how to edit or add other search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Identifying Your Current Search Engine
When using [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]], your default search engine might not always be Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It's possible that when you search, [[troubleshooting_search_engine_issues_in_chrome | Yahoo]] or another type of search engine appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This can sometimes happen inadvertently when downloading extensions or programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Accessing Search Engine Settings

To change or manage your search engine settings:
1.  Navigate to the top right of your [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]] browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  Go to the "settings" or "configuration" section (which is the same in English and Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  In the new tab that opens, find the "search engine" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This section allows you to manage the search engines [[managing_search_engine_settings_in_google_chrome | Google Chrome]] uses, such as Yahoo, Google, and many others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Managing Search Engines

Within the "search engine" section, you'll need to go to "Manage Search Engines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Here, you will see all the search engines currently installed in your browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

While Google may already be set as default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, you might find other search engines like Bing, Yahoo, or Ecosia listed as default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Editing an Existing Search Engine

If you wish to edit an existing search engine (e.g., Bing):
1.  Click the pencil icon next to the search engine you want to edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
2.  You can change its name and, if necessary, the link of the search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Adding Google as a Search Engine

If Google is not listed, or you need to re-add it:
1.  Click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  Enter "Google" as the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
3.  In the ShortCat or URL field, enter "Google.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It's important to use ".com" to avoid potential problems or regional restrictions you might encounter with country-specific domains like ".es" or ".uk" if you are not in that specific country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Saving Changes

Once you have made your desired edits or additions, remember to click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. There is no need to save anything else beyond this step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

To [[uploading_anime_content_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | upload anime content to YouTube without copyright issues]] or bans, it is crucial to edit the original video extensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. YouTube can ban videos due to copied network content, including audio (music, voices) or displayed images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although some videos might be monetized, others can be blocked or banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Strategies for Avoiding Bans

[[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_bans_on_anime_uploads | Strategies for avoiding YouTube bans on anime uploads]] primarily involve modifying both the visual and auditory elements of the original content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Video Editing Software

A video editing program, such as Filmora 9, can be used to modify video content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This allows for [[using_video_editing_software_to_modify_video_content | using video editing software to modify video content]] to circumvent YouTube's copyright detection systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Visual Modification Techniques

Implementing visual changes throughout the entire video can prevent YouTube from tracking copyright through images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

*   **Channel Logo/Watermark:** Integrate a channel logo prominently into the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This logo should be present for the entire duration of the video to modify the image being played <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Visual Effects:** Apply effects provided by the editing software, such as:
    *   **Light Leak:** An effect that alters the video's appearance, potentially making it brighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Borders/Frames:** Add an edge or border around the video, customizable in color (e.g., blue below, white above) to create a blurred effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The size of the video within the frame can also be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Complete Screen with Border and Logo:** A successful technique involves displaying the video on the complete screen with a border and a logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Audio Modification Techniques

Modifying the audio is as important as visual changes to avoid copyright detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Adjusting Volume:** When a video is imported into Filmora 9, it often comes with a default sound volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To prevent YouTube from detecting original audio peaks, slightly reduce the volume of the original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Viewers can still raise the volume on YouTube if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Uploading the Edited Video

After performing the necessary modifications to both the sound and visuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, the video can be exported from the editing software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

*   **Uploading to YouTube:** To upload the edited video, navigate to the YouTube upload section (e.g., "Create" then "Upload videos") and select the modified file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Checking for Restrictions:** Once uploaded, YouTube will process the video. It is important to verify that there are no restrictions on the upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. If successful, the video will be in public visibility without restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

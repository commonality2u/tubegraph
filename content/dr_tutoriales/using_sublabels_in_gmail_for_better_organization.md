Gmail allows users to organize their inbox by using labels and sublabels, which function similarly to folders but offer greater flexibility for sorting emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This method helps in [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | organizing emails]] based on categories such as news, subscriptions, or comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Accessing Label Settings

To begin [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | organizing your Gmail inbox with labels]], first enter your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Then, navigate to the **Configuration** settings by clicking on the gear icon usually located on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Within the configuration options, select the **Labels** window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This section allows you to manage which default labels are shown or hidden on the left-hand tray <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Creating New Labels and Sublabels

The primary function of the Labels window is to [[creating_labels_in_gmail | create new labels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Creation

1.  **Create a Parent Label:** To start, create a main label that will house related emails. For example, a label named "YouTube" can be created to centralize all emails related to YouTube activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
2.  **Create Sublabels (Nested Folders):** Within the parent label, you can [[creating_folders_in_gmail | create different sublabels]] or "folders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
    *   To create a sublabel, name it (e.g., "comments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   Select the option to "nest tag in" and choose the parent label, such as "YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This action visually places the sublabel slightly to the right, indicating its nested position within the parent label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Repeat this process for other subcategories, such as "subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Managing Labels

*   **Deleting Labels:** If you wish to remove a label, you can select the delete option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Modifying Labels:** To change the name or other properties of a label, select the modify option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying Labels to Emails

Once labels and sublabels are established, you can apply them to your emails.
1.  **Select Emails:** Search for or select all emails relevant to a specific sublabel, such as "subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  **Apply Label:** Right-click on the selected emails, choose "Tag how," and then select the appropriate sublabel, for example, "YouTube subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  **Filter View:** Now, filtering by this sublabel will display all emails assigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Visual Distinction with Colors

To further enhance [[managing_email_folders_in_gmail | email organization]], you can [[setting_colors_for_gmail_labels | set colors for your labels]] and sublabels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   For instance, the "YouTube" parent label and its sublabels like "YouTube subscriptions" can be assigned a red color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   Emails tagged with these labels will then appear in red in your inbox, making them easily distinguishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

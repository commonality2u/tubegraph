Investing BNB in BNB Vault offers multiple [[benefits_of_using_binances_bnb_token | Benefits of using Binance's BNB token]] and greater profitability compared to other methods like Launch Pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### [[comparison_between_bnb_vault_and_launch_pool | Comparison between BNB Vault and Launch Pool]]
While Launch Pool allows users to [[generating_cryptocurrencies_with_bnb_vault | generate cryptocurrencies]] by staking BNB (e.g., obtaining `TKO` and `LIT` cryptocurrencies with annual returns of 5% and 3.76% respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, BNB Vault offers superior benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>:
*   **Dual Rewards**: By investing in BNB Vault, you receive rewards from both the Launch Pool and additional rewards from savings, including `BNB` cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. This means you earn cryptocurrencies in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.
*   **Diverse Rewards**: BNB Vault periodically releases programs that can provide random rewards and other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. In contrast, staking BNB directly in Launch Pool only yields the cryptocurrencies offered by that specific system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

### Flexibility and Security
BNB Vault operates as flexible savings, allowing users to withdraw their BNB whenever they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. This means funds are not subject to locked staking periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. It is also considered a secure investment option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

This tutorial provides a step-by-step guide on how to send money using the Western Union platform, accessible via computer or mobile phone application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:18">[00:53:18]</a>. The Western Union mobile application is described as very simple to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:58">[00:56:58]</a>. The example provided uses the Spanish version of the Western Union website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.

## Sending Money with Western Union Online

To begin a transfer, you must first specify the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Western Union supports sending money to a wide variety of countries with different currency conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:88">[01:17:88]</a>.

### [[calculating_transfer_fees_and_exchange_rates_with_western_union | Calculating Transfer Fees and Exchange Rates]]

It is highly recommended to [[calculating_transfer_fees_and_exchange_rates_with_western_union | calculate the price]] to understand the associated costs of sending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:48">[01:33:48]</a>.

When determining the cost, you specify the origin country (which is usually pre-defined based on your location, e.g., Spain) and the recipient country (e.g., USA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:08">[02:07:08]</a>. The platform displays the amount sent in the origin currency (e.g., 100 euros) and the estimated amount the recipient will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:08">[02:20:08]</a>. The maximum amount that can be sent is up to 3,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:78">[02:26:78]</a>.

While the "transfer fee" might appear as zero euros, it is crucial to compare the exchange rate offered by Western Union with the real-time exchange rate between the two currencies involved (e.g., Euro and Dollar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:08">[02:45:08]</a>. For example, 100 euros might convert to 106.68 USD in real-time, but Western Union might offer 104.14 USD, indicating they retain a portion as their commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:08">[03:06:08]</a>.

### [[western_union_online_vs_cash_money_transfers | Recipient and Sender Options]]

Western Union offers different ways for money to be received and sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:08">[01:40:08]</a>.

*   **Recipient's Options:** The recipient can choose to receive money either in cash or directly to their bank account (online transfer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:08">[01:54:08]</a>.
*   **Sender's Options:** The sender must pay for the transfer online, either via credit/debit card or bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:08">[03:36:08]</a>. Cash payments by the sender are not an option for online transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:08">[03:46:08]</a>.

#### Impact of Recipient's Method on Exchange Rate
Choosing how the recipient receives the money affects the exchange rate and implied commission:
*   **Cash Pickup:** If the recipient chooses to receive cash, the exchange rate may be less favorable, resulting in the recipient receiving a slightly lower amount of USD (e.g., 4 USD less per 100 euros compared to a bank account transfer), even if the "transfer fee" is listed as zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:08">[04:30:08]</a>. This is considered a negative point as the platform does not explicitly state this increased commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:08">[04:51:08]</a>. However, Western Union is still considered a relatively cheap platform for international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:08">[04:55:08]</a>.
*   **Bank Account:** Receiving money via bank account generally offers a more favorable exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:08">[04:26:08]</a>.

### Transaction Speed

The time it takes for money to arrive depends on the payment and receiving methods:
*   **Credit/Debit Card Transfer (Sender) to Cash Pickup (Recipient):** Takes minutes to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:08">[03:56:08]</a>.
*   **Bank Account Transfer (Sender) to Bank Account (Recipient):** Typically takes one business day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:08">[04:16:08]</a>.
*   **Bank Account Transfer (Sender) to Cash Pickup (Recipient):** Arrives in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:08">[04:20:08]</a>.

### [[creating_and_managing_a_western_union_account | Creating an Account]]

To proceed with a transfer, you will need to either log in to an existing Western Union account or [[creating_and_managing_a_western_union_account | create a new one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:08">[05:01:08]</a>. Creating an account involves setting up a profile with your name, surname, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:88">[05:17:88]</a>.

### Recipient and Transaction Details

After selecting the payment method, you must provide the recipient's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:08">[05:39:08]</a>. If the recipient is receiving money via bank account, you will need to enter their bank account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:08">[05:53:08]</a>.

You will also need to specify the purpose of the transaction, the origin of the money, and your relationship with the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:08">[05:58:08]</a>. After providing all necessary information, you can review the entire transfer, including commissions and all data, before confirming the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:08">[06:05:08]</a>. Upon confirmation, you will receive a receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:08">[06:10:08]</a>.

## Tracking Transfers

Once a transfer is initiated, it can be tracked from the Western Union platform using the serial number associated with each transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:08">[06:50:08]</a>.

## My Western Union Rewards Program

Western Union offers a loyalty program called "My Western Union" or "My WU," where users earn points for making transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:08">[07:07:08]</a>. These points can provide benefits such as reduced commissions and other advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:08">[07:11:08]</a>.

## Referral Program

Western Union also has a referral program where you can get an electronic gift code (e.g., up to $20) if a friend opens an account using your affiliate link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:08">[07:42:08]</a>.

This tutorial explains how to [[creating_private_videos_on_youtube | create private videos on YouTube]] and [[sharing_private_youtube_videos | share them privately]] so that only selected individuals can view them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method ensures the video is not publicly visible or searchable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Steps to Share a Private YouTube Video

### 1. Set Video Visibility to Private

To begin, access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a> and navigate to the YouTube Channel Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

3.  In the "visibility" section, [[setting_video_visibility_to_private | set the video to private]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

5.  Enter the email addresses to which you want to send the video link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. These individuals will receive an email from YouTube containing a link to the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

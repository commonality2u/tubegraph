## Important Concepts for Transfers

Before initiating transfers, it's crucial to understand key concepts:
*   **Platform Compatibility** Only the Coinbase platform allows direct transfers to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. If funds are in Coinbase Pro, they must first be transferred to Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Name Verification** The name on your Coinbase account and [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | PayPal account]] must match the name on your identity document (e.g., DNI in Spain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | verification]] is simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Commissions**
    *   Transferring funds from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase incurs zero commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   Withdrawing money from Coinbase to PayPal is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   Converting cryptocurrencies within Coinbase Pro before transferring to Coinbase is recommended to avoid higher commissions charged by Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Withdrawing money from Coinbase to a bank account]] in the European Commission region costs 0.15 euros in commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Withdrawing Funds from Coinbase Pro to PayPal (Two Steps)

The Coinbase Pro platform does not allow direct withdrawals to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Funds must be transferred from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase first, then to PayPal. This process involves two steps:

### Step 1: Transferring Funds from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase

1.  Log in to your Coinbase Pro account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  Go to your portfolio ("by folios") to view your cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
3.  **Important**: Before transferring, convert your cryptocurrencies into the desired withdrawal currency (e.g., Euros) within Coinbase Pro to avoid higher conversion commissions on Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
4.  Once converted, click "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
5.  Select the currency you wish to withdraw (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
6.  Choose the option to "Transfer it to Coinbase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
7.  Enter the desired quantity (up to a daily limit of 250,000 euros for transfer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
8.  Confirm the transfer. The commission is zero, and the process is instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The funds will now appear in your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

1.  Log in to your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

3.  Click on the currency amount you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
4.  Click "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
5.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw, or select "Remove everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
6.  Click "Continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

8.  Review the withdrawal details (amount, zero withdrawal fee) and click "Withdraw now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
9.  A notification will be sent when the withdrawal is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Understanding how [[commission_fees for cryptocurrency transactions | transaction fees]] work is crucial when moving cryptocurrency between exchanges or to a bank account. This guide explains key aspects of these fees based on the provided tutorial.

## Withdrawing Cryptocurrency to a Bank Account

The process of withdrawing cryptocurrency to a bank account can be done from a mobile device, or other platforms like Android, iOS, or a computer, as the process is largely the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Exchange Commission Structures and Fees

When choosing an exchange for withdrawals, it's important to compare their fee structures.

### Coinbase vs. Kraken

The tutorial prefers using Kraken over Coinbase for withdrawing funds to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This preference is due to Coinbase charging higher fees for bank account withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Commission Discounts

Some exchanges, like Kraken, may offer [[exchange_commission_structures_and_fees | commission discounts]] through referral programs. For instance, a referral link for Kraken could provide a 20% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Example: Transferring Ethereum

To illustrate the process, the tutorial demonstrates transferring $4.16 in Ethereum from a Coinbase wallet to Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

### Transfer Process and Fees

1.  **Initiate Deposit on Kraken**: Within Kraken, navigate to the portfolio section, select Ethereum, and choose "deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Blockchain Network**: The deposit will be executed via the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
3.  **Transfer Duration**: The transfer is estimated to take approximately 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
4.  **Confirming Transaction**:
    *   The user must confirm the amount to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   The address copied from Kraken is pasted into the sending application (e.g., Coinbase wallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   The suggested network for the transaction is confirmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   The [[commission_fees for cryptocurrency transactions | transaction costs]] or "commissions" are displayed, which in this example ranged from $7.55 to $6.52 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   The user then confirms the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
5.  **Transaction Execution**: Once confirmed, the transaction is executed and marked as "Correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The asset will then appear as "being shipped" in the sending wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
6.  **Funds Arrival**: The specified amount of Ethereum will eventually appear within the Kraken account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

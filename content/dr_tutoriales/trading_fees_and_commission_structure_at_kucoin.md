KuCoin is a cryptocurrency exchange platform that offers various features for trading and managing digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article details the commission structure and fees associated with using the KuCoin platform.

## General Trading Commissions

KuCoin offers competitive trading commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. For both maker and taker orders, the standard commission is 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. These rates are considered relatively low and competent compared to other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>, including [[binance_commission_structure | Binance]], which also offers very low commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Volume-Based Fee Levels

[[exchange_commission_structures_and_fees | Commission fees for cryptocurrency transactions]] on KuCoin can vary based on trading volume and holdings:

*   **Bitcoin (BTC) Holding**: The trading rate level changes depending on the amount of Bitcoin a user holds in their spot account. Higher Bitcoin holdings can lead to reduced commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **KCS (KuCoin Token) Holding**: Fee levels are also influenced by the volume of KuCoin Shares (KCS) held over the most recent thirty days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. For instance, holding 10,000 KCS can significantly lower taker commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. At higher levels, such as level twelve, commissions can even become negative, meaning users are paid to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Deposit and Withdrawal Fees

KuCoin has a distinct approach to [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commission fees associated with cryptocurrency transactions]] and fiat money deposits:

*   **Cryptocurrency Deposits**: KuCoin does not charge any commission for depositing cryptocurrencies. Any fees for deposits are typically charged by the exchange where the user holds their cryptocurrencies before sending them to KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Withdrawals**: KuCoin charges a commission only when cryptocurrencies are withdrawn from the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A minimum withdrawal amount and a specific commission are set for each cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   For example, withdrawing USDT via the KCC network may incur a commission of ten cents of a dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Users can opt to convert their capital into a cryptocurrency with cheaper blockchain transfer fees to minimize withdrawal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Fiat Money Deposits (Indirect)**: KuCoin does not directly accept deposits of fiat money like EUR, GBP, or USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. When users [[buying_cryptocurrencies_on_kuCoin | buy cryptocurrencies]] using methods like Visa, Mastercard, or Apple Pay, KuCoin contracts an external company to facilitate the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   This external company charges an additional commission, making these deposits more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. For instance, a 100 EUR purchase of USDT might result in receiving 100.70 USDT (indicating a fee of 6 USD equivalent) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. For a quick purchase of 100 USD worth of USDT, users might receive 90 USDT, effectively incurring a 10 USDT fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
    *   These fees are often not transparently displayed during the transaction process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Fiat deposits can sometimes incur fees of up to 1-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, which is considerably higher than the fixed ten cents of a dollar for blockchain transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    *   The process involves depositing fiat to an external company, which then converts it into crypto assets accepted by KuCoin before transferring them to the user's account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This indirect method is why higher [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commissions are charged]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.

## P2P Trading Fees

KuCoin also supports Peer-to-Peer (P2P) trading, where users can directly trade cryptocurrencies with other individuals on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The price of cryptocurrencies in P2P transactions is usually similar to the market price, with minor variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Users can view available orders, execute ads, and post ads in the P2P section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

Interaction through comments is crucial for a YouTube channel's growth, as more engagement can lead to a video being promoted more frequently by YouTube's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Even negative comments are seen as beneficial for video positioning because they contribute to user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

While allowing all comments is generally recommended to maximize interaction, content creators may encounter inappropriate or disrespectful comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Strategy for Handling Inappropriate Comments

The approach described involves allowing all comments initially and then actively monitoring and managing them:
1.  **Allow All Comments:** The default setting for comments should be "Allow all comments" to ensure maximum interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
2.  **Monitor Notifications:** Receive notifications for new comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  **Delete Inappropriate Content:** If comments are found to be inappropriate, out of place, disrespectful, or destructive to the video's dynamics, they are deleted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Comment Management: Activating Comments

Before managing inappropriate comments, comments must first be enabled. To [[activating_comments_on_youtube_videos | activate comments]] on YouTube videos, three main considerations must be addressed within [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_comments | YouTube Studio configuration for comments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:

### 1. Channel Configuration
Access the **Configuration** section within [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_comments | YouTube Studio]] and navigate to **Channel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Under **Advanced Settings**, ensure the channel is marked as "No, it is not a channel created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. If marked as "Yes," comments will be banned on all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### 2. Video-Specific Content Setting
For individual videos, go to the video's **Details** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Confirm that the video is not designated as "Content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Setting it as content for children will result in comments being blocked by YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### 3. Video-Specific Comment Permissions
Within the video's **Details**, navigate to "More options" and locate the **Comments and ratings** section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. To allow engagement, select "Allow all comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Other options include disabling comments entirely or holding potentially inappropriate comments for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

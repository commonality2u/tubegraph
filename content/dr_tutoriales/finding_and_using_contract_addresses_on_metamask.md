The process is similar whether you are using a computer or a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Prerequisites
Before starting, ensure you are logged into your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. If you need help with [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | using MetaMask]] or creating an account, a tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Steps to Add USDT Token

### 1. Find the USDT Contract Address
The first step involves locating the contract address for USDT.

*   Open a new tab and navigate to a web page that lists cryptocurrencies and their existing contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. A link to such a platform is typically provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
*   In the search engine of this platform, type "USDT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Once USDT appears, you will see its contract details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Often, there will be a "little fox" icon next to the contract, indicating [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] integration if you have the extension installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 2. Add USDT to MetaMask

There are two primary methods to add the USDT token to your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] wallet:

#### Method A: Manual Addition using Contract Address
If the token does not automatically appear in [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] by searching, you can add it manually using its contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

*   On the cryptocurrency listing page, copy the USDT contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Open your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] extension or app.
*   Look for an option to "Import tokens" or "Add Custom Token" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   Paste the copied contract address into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] should then automatically detect "USDT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   Confirm the addition to see the USDT token listed in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

#### Method B: Automatic Addition via MetaMask Icon
Many listing platforms provide a direct way to add tokens to [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]]:

*   On the cryptocurrency listing page, click the "little fox" icon (MetaMask icon) next to the USDT contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   A [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] notification tab will open, prompting you to add the token <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   Once the loading is complete, you can add the token perfectly to your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   After adding, refresh your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] page, and the USDT token should appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Once the USDT token is listed, you can use it to convert other cryptocurrencies and [[withdrawing_from_metamask_to_bank_account | withdraw]] them if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This method simplifies [[how_to_add_usdt_token_to_metamask | importing the USDT token]] into your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

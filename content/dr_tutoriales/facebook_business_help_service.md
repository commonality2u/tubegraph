[[contacting_facebook_support | Contacting Facebook support]] can be a complex process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Often, the standard Facebook help link directs users to FAQs rather than direct support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. To access direct assistance, it is necessary to go through the "Help for businesses" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Accessing Business Help

Even if you haven't yet created a business account, you can quickly do so using your personal Facebook account without issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Once in the business help section, navigate to "First steps" or "Get in Service with the service contact of attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This leads to the "Help Account Overview for businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, where you can view recent account problems, resolved issues, and active or solved cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Initiating Contact

To get help, select "contact the service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Bypassing Redirection

When prompted to state your problem, a common issue is being redirected to another website if the problem doesn't directly relate to typical business issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. To avoid this, it's advised to select the option: "I think someone has accessed my company without permission," even if your actual problem is unrelated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. You can then explain your specific issue to the support agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Providing Information

After selecting the "unauthorized access" option, you will need to provide specific information to proceed:
*   Your company name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
*   Your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
*   A description of the help you need (e.g., "I need help to [[solving_facebook_account_issues | recover my Page]]") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
*   Your user identifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
*   The date of any suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
*   Indicate whether you have detected any suspicious users or advertising accounts with suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Starting a Chat

After [[providing_information_for_facebook_account_recovery | providing the information]], you can click "initiate" to begin the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The system will show an estimated waiting time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Click "Start chat" to open a [[starting_a_chat_with_facebook_support | chat window]] with Facebook Company Support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. You will then wait for a representative to respond, which may take several minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

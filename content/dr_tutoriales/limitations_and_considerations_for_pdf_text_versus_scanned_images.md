When attempting to translate PDF documents, a crucial distinction must be made between PDFs containing recognized text and those that are essentially scanned images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Recognizing Text-Based PDFs

For translation methods to be effective, the PDF must recognize its content as words, not as a scanned image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. For example, a scientific paper where the text is selectable and editable is in text format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This type of PDF can be opened and translated directly using various tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Limitations with Scanned Pages or Images

Methods for translating PDFs are generally not useful for documents formatted as images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. If a page is scanned, it is ultimately in image format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. To translate a scanned page, it first needs to be transformed from an image into text format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This means that if you want to translate a scanned page, the video tutorial for PDF translation methods will not serve your purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Methods Requiring Text-Based PDFs

Both native software and online tools for PDF translation require the document to be in an editable text format.

### Microsoft Word
Opening a PDF with Microsoft Word converts it into an editable text format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Once in Word, specific paragraphs or even the entire document can be selected and translated using Word's built-in translation feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Online Translators
Online services like Google Translate and DeepL also require the PDF to be in a text-readable format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Google Translate:** Accepts various document types, including Word, PowerPoint, and PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. It is a completely free service for translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **DeepL Translator:** Allows translation of PDF, DOC, or PPTX files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, DeepL may have character limits for free use, requiring a "Pro" subscription for longer documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

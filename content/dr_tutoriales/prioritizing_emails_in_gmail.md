Organizing emails in Gmail automatically helps prioritize incoming messages and keep your inbox clutter-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This method involves setting up filters to direct specific emails to designated [[managing_email_folders_in_gmail | folders]] upon arrival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Prerequisites: Gmail Folders

To begin, you should have [[creating_folders_in_gmail | email folders]] (known as labels in Gmail) already set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. If you need to create them, a separate tutorial can guide you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For this process, a common setup might include folders for YouTube, social networks, Google, and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Automating Email Organization

The goal is to [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | automatically organize]] emails so they bypass the main inbox and go directly into specific folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This allows you to manage emails based on priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Steps to Create a Filter:

1.  **Access Gmail**: Open your trusted browser, such as Google Chrome, and navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Identify Target Emails**: Select an email from the sender you wish to filter. For instance, if organizing YouTube notifications, select an email from `noreply@youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Filter Creation**: Click on the three-dot menu (More) and select "Filter similar messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This action automatically populates the filter criteria with the sender's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  **Configure Filter Settings**:
    *   Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Skip the Inbox (Archive it)**: Check "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" so emails do not appear in your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **Apply the Label**: Check "Apply the label" and select the desired folder (e.g., "YouTube") from the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. This ensures emails are marked as unread inside the folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   **Apply Filter to Existing Conversations**: Check "Also apply filter to matching conversations" to move all existing emails from that sender into the designated folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
5.  **Create Filter**: Click "Create filter" to finalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Once created, all emails from the specified sender will automatically move to the designated folder, skipping the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### [[demonstration_of_email_filtering_in_gmail | Demonstration]]

To illustrate the effectiveness of [[using_filters_to_manage_emails_in_gmail | email filtering]], an example involves sending a new comment notification from a secondary Google account to the main account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
Upon the new email's arrival, the number of emails in the "YouTube" folder increases, indicating the email was directly classified without appearing in the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This confirms that the email is automatically grouped and sorted as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

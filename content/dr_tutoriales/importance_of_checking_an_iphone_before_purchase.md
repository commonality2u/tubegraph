Before purchasing a second-hand iPhone, it is highly recommended to verify its status to ensure it is not reported as stolen, lost, or otherwise compromised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This verification process is crucial for preventing the purchase of a device that may be unusable or problematic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Key Identification: The IMEI Number

Every Apple device possesses a unique identification number known as an "e-mail number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>. This number is used by Apple to register a device as lost, disappeared, or stolen if reported by its original owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>. If a device is reported, its "e-mail number" is marked, making it identifiable as stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Therefore, checking this number is a fundamental [[how_to_identify_if_an_iphone_is_stolen_or_lost | step to identify if an iPhone is stolen or lost]] before a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

To check an iPhone's status, you will need access to the mobile device itself and an online web page designed for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Locating the "e-mail number" on the Device

The "e-mail number" can be found in several locations on an iPhone:

*   **Device Housing:** It may be printed directly on the device's casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **SIM Card Adapter:** The number can also be present on the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
*   **Settings Menu:** For operational iPhones, navigate to:
    1.  "Adjustments" (Settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
    2.  "General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    3.  "Information" (About) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
    4.  Scroll down to find the "e-mail numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Locked Devices:** If the device is locked or has been reset, a screenshot can guide you on how to find the "e-mail number," which is a simple process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

### [[understanding_dual_sim_email_numbers_in_iphones | Understanding Dual SIM "e-mail numbers"]]

Modern iPhones often feature dual SIM capabilities, meaning they will have two distinct "e-mail numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Each "e-mail number" is associated with a SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. If an iPhone has two "e-mail numbers," it is imperative to check both of them to ensure the device is clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## [[using_online_tools_to_verify_an_iphones_status | Using online tools to verify an iPhone's status]]

Once you have the "e-mail number" (or numbers), you can use an online tool to verify the iPhone's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

1.  **Access the web page:** The necessary web page can typically be found through links provided in tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Input the "e-mail number":** Copy the "e-mail number" from your device and paste it into the designated field on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Complete verification:** Confirm you are not a robot by completing any required captcha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.
4.  **Check the status:** The tool will then indicate if the "e-mail number" is reported, stolen, or otherwise flagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

The results will typically show if the iPhone is activated, its "Find My iPhone" status, and whether it is marked as stolen or on a "BlackBook" (blacklist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>. It may also display the iPhone model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This ensures that the device is unlocked and not reported as lost or stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

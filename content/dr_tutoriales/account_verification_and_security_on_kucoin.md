KuCoin is a cryptocurrency trading platform that offers a variety of features and products, which the speaker finds very attractive and worth analyzing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The platform's interface and features are covered in a series of video tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Account Verification (KYC)

To buy, sell, and operate with cryptocurrencies on KuCoin, users must verify their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The verification process, often referred to as KYC (Know Your Customer), involves:
*   Registering with a national ID (DNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   Taking a photo of the ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Taking a selfie with the ID to confirm identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Security Features

The security of your account is paramount, especially since money is held on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. KuCoin strongly recommends using Google Authenticator for enhanced security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Google Authenticator:** This mobile application provides a constantly changing code (every 10-15 seconds) that is required to log in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Importance:** Employing multiple security measures, such as Google Authenticator, helps ensure your capital is insured and prevents unauthorized access to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Fee Levels and Transparency

KuCoin offers competitive trading fees.
*   **Maker/Taker Fees:** The standard maker and taker fees are 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These are considered relatively low and competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. For comparison, [[security_features_and_account_settings_on_binance | Binance]] is also noted for offering very low commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Volume-Based Rates:** Trading fees can decrease further based on your trading volume and the amount of KuCoin's native token, KCS, held in the last 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   For example, holding 10,000 KCS significantly lowers taker commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   At level 12, commissions can even become negative, meaning users are paid to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This system incentivizes users to operate and hold KCS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Deposit and Withdrawal Fees

When reviewing deposit and withdrawal fees:
*   **Cryptocurrency Deposits:** KuCoin generally does not charge commissions for cryptocurrency deposits. These fees are typically charged by the external exchange from which the cryptocurrencies are sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Withdrawals:** KuCoin charges a commission only when users want to [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_kucoin_to_a_bank_account | withdraw]] cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A minimum withdrawal amount and a specific commission are set per cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   For instance, withdrawing USDT via KCC costs ten cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   It's possible to convert capital into a cryptocurrency with cheaper transfer fees to minimize costs when moving crypto between platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

## Fiat Money Deposits and Hidden Fees

KuCoin does not directly accept fiat money (e.g., Euros, Dollars, Pounds) deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Process:** To [[how_to_deposit_capital_on_kucoin | deposit capital on KuCoin]] using fiat currency (via credit/debit card, Apple Pay, SEPA, etc.), users deposit money to an external company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This external company then converts the fiat into a crypto asset (like USDT) that KuCoin accepts and transfers it to the user's KuCoin account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.
*   **Commissions:** This indirect process results in higher commissions, sometimes up to 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For example, depositing 100 Euros might incur a 6 USD commission that is not transparently displayed on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. This lack of transparency regarding additional fees for fiat deposits is a noted negative point for the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.
*   **Fiat vs. Crypto Withdrawal Fees:** A 3% fiat deposit fee for 100 Euros (3 Euros) is significantly higher than a 10-cent blockchain transfer fee for cryptocurrencies, regardless of the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This is an important distinction for users to be aware of to avoid losing money when making deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Other Account Management Features

Beyond verification and security, the account section allows users to manage API settings and create sub-accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

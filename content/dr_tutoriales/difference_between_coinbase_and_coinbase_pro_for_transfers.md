When [[transferring_cryptocurrency_between_platforms | transferring cryptocurrency]] from your exchange accounts to a PayPal account, there is a significant difference in functionality between [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] and [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase Pro]].

## Direct Transfers to PayPal
The primary distinction is that only the [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] platform allows for direct transfers to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>.

### Transfers from Coinbase Pro
If your funds are held within [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase Pro]], you will need to perform a two-step process to transfer them to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>:
1.  **Transfer from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase:** Move your cryptocurrency or fiat currency from your [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase Pro]] account to your [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:08">[01:43:08]</a>. This internal transfer is instant and has no commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:07">[06:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>.
    *   It is recommended to transform cryptocurrencies into the desired withdrawal currency (e.g., euros) within [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase Pro]] before transferring to [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:03">[05:18:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:13">[05:21:13]</a>. This is because conversion fees are generally higher on [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] compared to [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:34">[05:28:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:07">[05:31:07]</a>.
    *   To initiate this transfer from [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase Pro]]: Navigate to "Portfolios," select your currency, and choose "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:03">[05:43:03]</a>. Then select the option to transfer to [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:07">[05:53:07]</a>.
2.  **Transfer from Coinbase to PayPal:** Once the funds are in your [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] account, proceed with the withdrawal to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:25">[01:46:25]</a>.

### Transfers from Coinbase
If your funds are already within your [[comparison_of_binance_and_coinbase_pro | Coinbase]] account, the process is simpler, requiring only one step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>:

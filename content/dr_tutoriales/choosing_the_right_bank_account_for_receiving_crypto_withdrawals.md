When [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing cryptocurrency to a bank account]], it is crucial to select the appropriate bank account, as not all financial institutions accept withdrawals from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Challenges with Conventional Banks

Conventional banks, such as Santander or BBVA, often do not permit withdrawals from centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. In many instances, transactions may be blocked, causing the funds to be returned to the centralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Recommended Neobanks

To avoid issues, it is recommended to use "neobanks" that are more compatible with crypto transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. The following neobanks are suggested for receiving crypto withdrawals:
*   Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>
*   N26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>

These two neobanks are highlighted as powerful options for conducting transactions with crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

This guide explains how to navigate Google Chrome's settings to manage pop-up windows and redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>.

## Accessing Google Chrome Settings

To begin, open the Google Chrome browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">00:00:50</a>. The first step is to access the configuration part, which is located in the upper right-hand corner of the browser window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>. Click on this configuration section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">00:01:03</a>.

## Navigating to Advanced Settings

Once in the general configuration menu, select "advanced settings" to view more detailed menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>.

## Managing Pop-up Windows and Redirects

There are two primary ways to find the settings for pop-up windows and redirects:

1.  **Using the Search Bar**: In the search engine within the settings, type "emerging" or "pop-ups" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">00:01:19</a>. This will lead you directly to the "site configuration" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">00:01:25</a>.
2.  **Manual Navigation**:
    *   Go to the "[[google_chrome_privacy_and_security_settings | Privacy and security]]" section on the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">00:01:30</a>.
    *   Click on "Site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">00:01:32</a>.
    *   Within "Site configuration," scroll down to "Permissions" and locate the option for "windows emerging redirects" (pop-ups and redirects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">00:01:38</a>.

### Enabling or Disabling Pop-ups Globally

By default, the setting for "windows emerging redirects" states "not allowing have sites send windows emerging or use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>. To enable pop-ups for all sites, click on this option and switch it to allow sites to send pop-ups and use redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">00:01:53</a>.

### [[blocking_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | Blocking Pop-ups for Specific Sites]]

You can also block specific sites from sending pop-ups, even if the general setting allows them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">00:02:06</a>.
For example, to prevent [[using_google_chrome_to_loop_youtube_videos | YouTube]] from sending pop-ups:
1.  Locate the section to "Block some specific sites" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">00:02:06</a>.
2.  Click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">00:02:15</a>.
3.  Enter the website address, e.g., "WWW.YouTube.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">00:02:17</a>.
4.  Click "Add" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">00:02:22</a>.
Once added, [[using_google_chrome_to_loop_youtube_videos | YouTube]] will no longer send pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">00:02:23</a>. This allows for fine-tuned control over which pages are permitted to display pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">00:02:27</a>.

In summary, you have the following options for pop-up windows:
*   Activate them for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">00:02:37</a>.
*   Deactivate them for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">00:02:41</a>.
*   Have them activated only for specific pages (by blocking unwanted sites) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">00:02:43</a>.

From: [[dr_tutoriales]] <br/> 

Generating revenue through the Amazon Affiliate Program, even without access to the Amazon API code, is possible using specific WordPress plugins and configuration. The Amazon API code is typically required after completing three initial affiliate sales on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. However, a free plugin can facilitate advertising Amazon products on a WordPress site, enabling users to [[generating_commissions_from_amazon_affiliates | make money with affiliates]] from Amazon without the API <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Plugin Installation: Droxypin and Affiliation Weed Amazon

To begin promoting Amazon products on a WordPress website without needing the API code, a plugin can be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "Plugins" section in the left-hand menu of your WordPress dashboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
2.  Click on "Add New" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

4.  Install and activate the plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This free plugin is highly useful for promoting Amazon products on a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Plugin Configuration

### Entering Your Amazon Affiliate ID

The first step in [[using_amazon_affiliate_account | using the Amazon affiliate account]] with the plugin is to enter your Amazon Affiliate ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This ensures that all purchases made through your links are assigned to your account, attributing sales to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

1.  Go to the "Amazon" section within the plugin settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  Enter your Amazon Affiliate ID and select your country of origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

**How to Find Your Amazon Affiliate ID**:
If you are unsure where to find your ID, navigate to your Amazon Associates page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
1.  Go to "Account settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

### General Settings

Under the "General" section of the plugin settings, you can customize various characteristics of how Amazon products are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

*   **Products per page**: Adjust the number of products displayed per page to avoid saturating your website visitors (e.g., eight products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **"Buy" Button Text**: Customize the text of the purchase button. While it defaults to English, you can change it to "Buy it now," "Buy," or any other call to action you prefer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. A concise message like "Buy" in capital letters can directly encourage sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

Most other advanced customization options are available only in the Pro version of the plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Remember to save your settings after making changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Methods for Promoting Amazon Products

The plugin provides several shortcodes (referred to as "codes" in the transcript) to display Amazon products on your website, facilitating [[creating_amazon_affiliate_links | the creation of Amazon affiliate links]].

### 1. Amazon Search Bar (WPAS_Search)

This code creates a search bar on your website, allowing visitors to search for Amazon products directly from your site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When a user searches (e.g., "Samsung tablet"), a dropdown will appear showing relevant Amazon products based on the search query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Purchases made through these searches will be linked to your affiliate ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

*   **Code**: `[WPAS_Search]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>

### 2. Automatic Product Display (WPAS_Products - Algorithm-Based)

This method allows Amazon to automatically display products based on its algorithms and Google's algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These are typically highly-sold, well-valued, and recommended products that Amazon believes will interest your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. While this can generate commissions if products are purchased, you do not choose the specific products displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This means it might show products unrelated to your website's niche (e.g., books or water bottles on a technology site) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

*   **Code**: `[WPAS_Products]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

### 3. Specific Product Display (WPAS_Products - ASIN Code)

This is a highly useful method for promoting specific products. By using the Amazon Standard Identification Number (ASIN) code, you can display individual products directly on your page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. The ASIN code can be found in the product's URL on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **Code**: `[WPAS_Products asin="ASIN_CODE"]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>
    *   **Example**: To display an iPad, find its ASIN (e.g., B08J72XXXX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a> and use `[WPAS_Products asin="B08J72XXXX"]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. This ensures that the product promoted is exactly what you intend, linked to your affiliate ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

You can also display multiple specific products in a dropdown or row by separating their ASINs with commas within the same code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This is particularly powerful for creating comparison charts or curated lists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

*   **Code for multiple products**: `[WPAS_Products asin="ASIN1,ASIN2,ASIN3"]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>

### 4. Keyword-Based Product Display (WPAS_Products - Keyword)

This method allows you to display Amazon products based on specific keywords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This is useful for promoting products related to a theme or category on your website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. When entering multiple words, use a plus symbol (`+`) instead of a space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

*   **Code**: `[WPAS_Products keywords="your+keywords"]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>
    *   **Example**: To display cheap tablets, use `[WPAS_Products keywords="cheap+tablets"]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. The plugin will then deploy a list of cheap tablets from Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. The number of products displayed will correspond to the "products per page" setting you configured earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

## Optimizing Product Display

To make the "buy" button more prominent and familiar to users, you can customize its appearance to match Amazon's standard yellow color and desired width <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

1.  Go to the "Customize" section of your WordPress theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Additional CSS" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.
3.  Paste custom CSS code (often provided by the plugin developer or found in tutorials) to style the button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This can increase user confidence and encourage clicks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>, contributing to [[optimizing_amazon_product_promotion_for_increased_sales | increased sales]].

By effectively utilizing this plugin and its various shortcodes, you can create a powerful platform for [[benefits_of_amazon_affiliates_program | Amazon affiliate marketing]] on your WordPress site, even without the Amazon API, streamlining [[generating_commissions_from_amazon_affiliates | the process of generating commissions]].

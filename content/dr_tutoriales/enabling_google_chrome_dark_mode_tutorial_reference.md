A previous video tutorial is referenced for users interested in activating dark mode in [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20"></a>. This setting allows users to set [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]] "in dark, in black," which is suggested to cause "less damage to your eyesight" if preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22"></a>.

The speaker notes that some individuals prefer to work with a dark screen and white letters, as opposed to a white screen with black letters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28"></a>. The tutorial for this feature is available via a card presented at the beginning of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20"></a>.

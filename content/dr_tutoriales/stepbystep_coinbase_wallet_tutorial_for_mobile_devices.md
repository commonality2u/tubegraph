Mobile devices are convenient for [[managing_cryptocurrency_wallets | managing cryptocurrencies]] anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

## Availability and Download
Coinbase Wallet is available for download through Google Play for Android devices and the App Store for iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. It can also be added as an extension for Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

To download the application:
1.  Go to Google Play (for Android) or the App Store (for iOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
2.  Search for "Coinbase Wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
3.  Click "Download" (or "Open" if already downloaded) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Wallet

### Initial Setup
1.  Upon opening the app, you can choose to enter with your Google account or create a new wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
2.  Confirm and accept the terms of service and privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
3.  Set a username for your wallet. This username can be public, allowing other Coinbase Wallet users to search for you and send cryptocurrencies, or private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. It is generally recommended to set it as public in case someone wants to send you crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### [[security_and_storage_options_in_coinbase_wallet | Security and Storage Options]]
Coinbase Wallet provides [[security_and_storage_options_in_coinbase_wallet | secure storage]] for your cryptocurrencies, protected with secure multi-factor authentication and a cloud backup option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

1.  **Protect Your Wallet**: You can enable security measures like Face ID (for iPhone) or set a password for your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Backup Your Wallet**:
    *   **Recovery Phrase**: The wallet will ask you to back up your Coinbase Wallet, emphasizing that losing the recovery phrase means losing access to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
    *   You will be provided with a 12-word recovery phrase, which is essentially your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
    *   You can choose to back it up via iCloud or manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:00">[04:12:00]</a>.
    *   For manual backup, copy these words (e.g., by taking a screenshot or writing them down) and store them securely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
    *   After copying, the app will ask you to re-enter the words in the correct order to confirm the backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

## Wallet Interface Overview
Once set up, the Coinbase Wallet interface shows your current balance (e.g., zero dollars initially) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. You can view your coins and NFTs associated with your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.

The bottom menu of the wallet typically includes three main sections:
*   **Wallet**: This is the primary section for managing your crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   **Internet**: Allows you to access online platforms and decentralized applications (dApps) through a built-in browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Settings**: Here you can configure account-related options, active wallets, and clean pending transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. You can also choose the blockchain you are using, such as Ethereum (ETH) or Binance Smart Chain (BSC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

## [[how_to_send_receive_and_trade_cryptocurrencies_using_coinbase_wallet | Sending, Receiving, and Trading Cryptocurrencies]]

The "Wallet" section offers options to Send, Receive, and Trade cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Receiving Cryptocurrencies
1.  Tap "Receive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
2.  Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to receive (e.g., Litecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.
3.  The wallet will display your address (a QR code and text address) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. You can share this address with the sender from platforms like Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
4.  You can also receive payments via your username <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Sharing your username via WhatsApp or other contacts allows other Coinbase Wallet users to send you crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

### Sending Cryptocurrencies
To send cryptocurrencies, you can choose to send from your Coinbase account (main or another connected wallet) or directly from your Coinbase Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
1.  Tap "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
2.  **Connecting to Coinbase Account**:
    *   To send crypto from your main Coinbase account, you will need to connect your Coinbase Wallet to your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.
    *   The app will automatically open your Coinbase account for authorization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
    *   Once connected, you will see the cryptocurrencies and cash you hold in your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
3.  **Sending from Wallet**: If you have crypto already in your Coinbase Wallet, you can scan a QR code or manually enter the recipient's wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.

### Buying Cryptocurrencies
You can buy cryptocurrencies directly through Coinbase Wallet by connecting to the Coinbase platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
1.  Select "Buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.
2.  Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to buy (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount you want to buy (e.g., in USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
4.  You can add a payment method, such as a credit/debit card, or use the cash balance available in your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. When the wallet is connected to your Coinbase platform, all funds, both crypto and cash, are linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Trading/Converting Cryptocurrencies
In the "Trade" section, you can convert cryptocurrencies to dollars or exchange one cryptocurrency for another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. This allows you to manage your crypto portfolio directly within the wallet.

## Using the In-App Internet Browser
The middle button on the bottom menu provides access to the internet, allowing you to connect to online wallet platforms and dApps (decentralized applications) through a search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This connection can be made simply, for example, with networks like PancakeSwap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

## Important Considerations
*   Coinbase Wallet is an independent wallet separate from the main Coinbase exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   Transfers made to or from Coinbase Wallet (or other platforms) will incur commissions associated with the specific blockchain network being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   It is often recommended to use networks with lower transaction fees (e.g., Litecoin or other cheaper networks) for transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>. Once the funds are in your wallet, you can convert them to other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

This allows you to securely store, convert, send, and receive cryptocurrencies directly from your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:00">[10:56:00]</a>.

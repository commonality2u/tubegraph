This guide explains the process of creating and managing video content on YouTube, from initial upload to post-processing checks and visibility settings.

## Uploading Videos to YouTube

Uploading videos to the YouTube platform is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

### Prerequisites

Before uploading, users must access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> and have a YouTube channel created, which is typically associated with a Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Steps to Upload

1.  **Access [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]]**: Once on the YouTube platform and logged into your channel, navigate to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Upload**: Within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]], click on the "upload videos" icon (represented by an arrow) or the "Create" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This menu also offers an option to broadcast live to subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  **Select Video File**: You will need to select a video file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. There are two primary methods for this:
    *   **Drag and Drop**: Drag the video file directly to the YouTube platform window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Select File Button**: Click "select file" and choose the source file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
4.  **Content Editing**: Once the video begins uploading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>, you will proceed to the content editing process. This includes adding the title, description, thumbnail, and integrating playlists or cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
5.  **Finalize Upload**: After entering details, click "next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. The video will then appear in your list of uploaded videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Managing Uploaded Videos

After a video is uploaded, it undergoes processing and can be managed from within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]].

### Accessing Uploaded Videos

All uploaded videos can be viewed by navigating to the "Videos" section on the left-hand menu in [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. New uploads, especially a first video, will appear here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Processing and Checks

YouTube processes the video to check for several factors:
*   **Copyright Rules**: It verifies if any copyright rules are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Platform Requirements**: It ensures the video meets all platform requirements and adheres to YouTube's censorship rules regarding appropriate content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Duplicate Files**: YouTube prevents the upload of duplicate videos; if a file is identical to one already uploaded, the processing will be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Visibility Settings

By default, an uploaded video's visibility is set to public, provided there are no copyright or other restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For viewers to watch your videos, they must be set to public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

Visibility can be adjusted to your preference:
*   **Public**: Visible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Private**: Only visible to you and selected viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Unlisted (Hidden)**: Not visible in search results or channel pages, but accessible via a direct link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Editing Video Details

Within the "details" section of a video, you can edit various features that were initially set during the upload process, such as the title, description, and other video characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

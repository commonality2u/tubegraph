This guide explains how to deposit funds into your PayPal account, whether you're using a computer or a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Process to Deposit Funds

1.  **Log in to Your PayPal Account**
    Access your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

2.  **Navigate to Transfer Money Options**
    *   Once logged in, you can go to the "PayPal balance" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, navigate to "My wallet" and then select "Transfer Money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
    *   Within the transfer options, select "Add money to your balance PayPal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

3.  **Choose Your Deposit Method**
    PayPal offers two primary ways to deposit funds:
    *   **Using a [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked bank account]]:** Log in to your bank's online services to initiate a transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   **Physical bank transfer:** Go to your bank and perform a transfer using the PayPal banking details provided on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Bank Transfers

*   **[[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | Link your bank account]] FIRST:** It is crucial that the bank account you use for the transfer is already [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to your PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. If you attempt a transfer from an unlinked bank account, it will be automatically rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   **Verification Process for Linking a Bank Account:**
    *   Linking typically takes one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   PayPal will make a small transfer (e.g., one cent) to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   You will then need to confirm the exact amount of this transfer within PayPal to complete the [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linking process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Transfer Details:**
    *   When making the deposit, use the provided IBAN and beneficiary bank details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   It is not necessary to put anything in the "concept" or "description" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
    *   Ensure you enter the correct beneficiary name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Processing Time:**
    *   You will receive an email confirmation once the funds are deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
    *   Bank transfers can take one to two business days to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Note that non-working days are not included in this timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

[[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | Uploading videos]] to the YouTube platform is a simple process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Accessing YouTube Studio for Uploads

The first step is to access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. You must have a channel created; if not, you'll need to create one associated with a Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Once on the YouTube platform and with your channel set up, navigate to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Initiating the Upload Process

Within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]], there are two main ways to begin an upload:
*   Look for the upload icon, often depicted as an arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Click the "Create" button, which will also present the "Upload videos" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

After selecting the upload option, you will need to choose a computer file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Uploading Your Video File

Videos can be uploaded using two methods:
1.  **Dragging and Dropping:** Drag the video file directly to the YouTube platform within the upload interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  **Selecting a File:** Click "Select file" and choose the source video file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Once selected, the video will begin to upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Post-Upload Processing and Details

After the video begins uploading, you will move to the content editing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This includes adding:
*   Title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   Thumbnail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   Playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>
*   Cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>

### Video Processing and Checks

Once uploaded, the video will appear in your list of uploaded videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. To view your uploaded videos, navigate to the "Videos" section by clicking the icon on the left in [[youtube_studio_navigation | YouTube Studio navigation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

The video will be "processing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. During this time, [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube]] checks if any copyright rules are violated or if the content meets all requirements and censorship rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Visibility and Restrictions

By default, the visibility is set to "Public," and it should ideally show "no copyright or other restriction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For people to watch your videos, they must be public and free of restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

You can change the visibility by clicking on it and choosing options like [[creating_private_videos_on_youtube | private]], hidden, or public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Duplicate File Warning

[[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] will inform you if the uploaded file is a duplicate of a video you have already uploaded, as you cannot upload the same video twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

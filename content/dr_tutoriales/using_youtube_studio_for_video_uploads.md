To [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_YouTube | upload videos]] to YouTube, the process is designed to be simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This guide will walk you through [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] for uploading videos.

## Accessing YouTube Studio

First, you must access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. You need to have a channel created on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. If you only have a YouTube account associated with Gmail, you will need to create a channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Once your channel is created, navigate to [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Initiating an Upload

Within [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]], there are two main ways to start an upload:
*   Look for an upload icon, typically an arrow pointing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   Alternatively, click the "Create" button, which will also present the option to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_YouTube | upload videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This "Create" option also allows you to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_YouTube | broadcast live]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Selecting Your Video File

To upload your video, you will need to select a computer file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This can be done in two ways:
1.  **Drag and Drop**: Drag the video file directly to the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  **Select File**: Click "Select file" and choose the source file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Once selected, the video will begin to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_YouTube | upload]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Video Processing and Visibility

After the video starts uploading, you will move to the [[content_editing_and_video_management_on_YouTube | content editing]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This stage includes setting the title, description, thumbnail, playlist, and cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

While uploading, YouTube processes the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This processing checks for:
*   Violation of copyright rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Compliance with YouTube's censorship and content appropriateness rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

By default, the visibility is often set to public if no copyright or other restrictions are found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For people to watch your videos, the visibility must be set to "Public" and have no restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. You can change the visibility to your preference, including "Private" or "Hidden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Managing Uploaded Videos

After clicking "Next," the video will appear in your list of uploaded videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. You can access this list by navigating to the "Videos" section on the left-hand side of [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This section displays all your uploaded videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Important Considerations:
*   **Duplicate Uploads**: You cannot [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_YouTube | upload]] the exact same video file twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If you try to upload a duplicate, the processing will be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Video Details**: Within the video details section, you can edit features like the title, description, and other video characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This allows for further [[content_editing_and_video_management_on_YouTube | content editing]] even after the initial [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_YouTube | upload]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

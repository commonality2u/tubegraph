When attempting to [[steps_to_recall_a_sent_email_in_outlook | cancel or delete a sent email]] within Outlook, a critical condition for the recall to be successful is that the recipient must **not** have opened the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Crucial Requirement
> For the email recall feature to function, it is "super important" that the recipient has not yet opened the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the message has already been opened, the recall attempt will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

This specific limitation means that the timing of the recall attempt is vital, as the window for a successful recall closes the moment the recipient views the email.

For further techniques within Outlook, you can learn how to [[using_signatures_for_replies_and_forwarded_emails_in_outlook | edit the signature]] or [[delaying_email_delivery_in_outlook | schedule shipments mail]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

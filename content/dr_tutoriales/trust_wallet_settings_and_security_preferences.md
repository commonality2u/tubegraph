## Wallet Creation and Management

Before using Trust Wallet, users must download the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Upon opening, users have the option to [[creating_and_importing_wallets_on_trust_wallet | import an existing wallet]] or create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Creating a New Wallet
When creating a new wallet, the following steps are required:
1.  **Accept Privacy Policy:** Users must accept the privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  **Set Access Code:** An access code or password needs to be entered twice for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  **Backup Wallet Security:** The application prompts the user to make a copy of the wallet's security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Importing an Existing Wallet
If a user already has a wallet, they will need to [[creating_and_importing_wallets_on_trust_wallet | import]] the 12-word recovery phrase in the correct order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. After entering the phrase, the password must be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Security Features

Trust Wallet emphasizes the importance of [[backing_up_and_securing_your_wallet | backing up and securing your wallet]] through its secret phrase.

### Secret Phrase (Recovery Phrase)
The application will display a 12-word secret phrase which is crucial for wallet recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Users must accept conditions that highlight the risks of losing or exposing this phrase:
*   **Loss of Funds:** Losing the secret phrase means permanent loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Theft Risk:** Sharing or exposing the phrase can lead to theft of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **User Responsibility:** Trust Wallet is not responsible for lost funds if the user loses their phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> It is highly recommended to copy the secret phrase onto a physical paper rather than storing it digitally on a PC, as a PC is vulnerable to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

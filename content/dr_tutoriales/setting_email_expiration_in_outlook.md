When [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduling emails]] in Outlook, you can also set an expiration date for the scheduled delivery of the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This feature specifies a deadline for the scheduled shipment to occur.

## Important Consideration: Outlook Must Be Open
A crucial point to understand about [[delaying_email_delivery_in_outlook | delaying email delivery]] or [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduling emails]] in Outlook is that the email will *only* be sent if Outlook is open on your computer at the scheduled time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. If, for instance, you schedule an email for tomorrow at 5:00, but your Outlook application is not open on your computer at that time, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. The video identifies this as a "weak point" of Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

The expiration setting addresses this limitation.

## How to Set Email Expiration

1.  **Compose a New Email**: Start by creating a new email message in Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Access Delay Delivery Options**: Once your email is written, navigate to the "Options" tab in the email composer window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Select Delay Delivery**: Click on "Delay Delivery" (or "Delay Shipment" if your interface is in another language) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
4.  **Set the Expiration Date**: In the "Properties" dialog box, you will find options for scheduling the delivery date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Within these options, you can also specify an "Expires" date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This date dictates when the scheduled delivery itself expires if Outlook has not been opened by the original scheduled send time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Settings**: After setting the desired expiration date, click "Close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> and then "Send" the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The email will now be queued for sending with the specified delivery and expiration parameters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

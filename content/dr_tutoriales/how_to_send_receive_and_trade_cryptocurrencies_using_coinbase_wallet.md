[[how_coinbase_wallet_works | Coinbase Wallet]] serves as a secure application for storing cryptocurrencies and tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>. It is available on Google Play, the App Store, and as a Google Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>. This guide focuses on its use on mobile devices due to the application's similarity across Android and iOS platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>, allowing for cryptocurrency management on the go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:28">[01:01:28]</a>.

## Getting Started with Coinbase Wallet on Mobile

To begin [[stepbystep_coinbase_wallet_tutorial_for_mobile_devices | using Coinbase Wallet on your mobile device]], first download the application from Google Play (for Android) or the App Store (for iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>. Upon opening the app, you can choose to log in with a Google account or create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:42">[02:02:42]</a>. You'll need to confirm the terms of service and privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:48">[02:02:48]</a>, and set a username <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:53">[02:02:53]</a>.

### Privacy and Security Setup
When setting up, you'll choose your privacy type:
*   **Public**: Allows other Coinbase Wallet users to search your username and send you cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:10">[03:03:10]</a>.
*   **Private**: Prevents other wallets from searching for yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:16">[03:03:16]</a>.

You can protect your wallet using Face ID or a password, depending on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:27">[03:03:27]</a>. Crucially, you must back up your Coinbase Wallet, as losing your recovery phrase will result in permanent loss of access to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:43">[03:03:43]</a>. This backup involves recording a secret recovery phrase (typically 12 words) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:55">[04:03:55]</a>.

Decentralized Finance (Defi) offers opportunities for significant profitability with cryptocurrencies, but it is important to understand the associated risks and how to monitor investments effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. While Defi can provide very good returns, including annual returns greater than 30% or even 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, investors are also exposed to high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Understanding Defi Risks

Defi is described as "not a very sure product," despite its potential for high profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Key risks include:

*   **Platform Responsibility**: Platforms like Binance state they act only as service platforms and do not guarantee that projects will always function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. They are not responsible for losses incurred due to the vulnerability of a project's smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
*   **Project Vulnerability**: Some Defi projects have "disappeared" or failed due to contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.
*   **Variable Returns**: The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in Defi is not a fixed value; it adjusts daily based on chain rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. This means profitability can be negative at times, not always positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

> **Note**: It is strongly recommended to start with a small capital to gain initial experience with Defi products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Key Considerations for [[selecting_defi_projects_for_investment | Selecting Defi Projects]]

Before investing, it is crucial to:
*   **Research the Project**: Inform yourself about the specific Defi project you are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Understand the Cryptocurrency**: Analyze the cryptocurrency involved in the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Analyze Offered Returns**: Carefully review the returns being offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Remember that higher durations for locked capital typically yield more profitability, though this is not always consistent across all products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   **Read the Agreement**: Always read and understand the Defi agreement before accepting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

## [[understanding_flexible_and_locked_defi_staking | Flexible vs. Locked Defi Staking]]

When engaging in Defi, you will typically find two types of staking durations:
*   **Flexible Lock**: This option allows you to deposit cryptocurrencies and withdraw them at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
*   **Locked Defi**: This requires your cryptocurrencies to be held for a specific period, such as 7 or 30 days, depending on your selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Monitoring Your Defi Investments

To monitor your Defi investments, you can navigate to the "Wallet" section, then to the "Earn" part of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.
From there, select the "Defi" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. You will then have the option to view either your "Flexible" or "Blocked" Defi investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. This allows you to see the cumulative profitability of your cryptocurrency and how much you have earned at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.

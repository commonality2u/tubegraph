This tutorial demonstrates how to add [[applying_superscript_formatting | superindices]] (superscripts) and [[applying_subscript_formatting | subindices]] (subscripts) to text within Microsoft Excel cells, including their application within [[excel_graph_formatting | Excel graphs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The method shown avoids traditional workarounds like using arrows to indicate desired positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Applying Superscript Formatting (Superindices)

Superscripts are characters that appear slightly above the baseline, often used for exponents or scientific notation.

### Steps to Apply
1.  Double-click the cell containing the text you wish to format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
2.  Select the specific character(s) you want to convert to a superscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  Right-click the selected character(s) and choose "Format Cells..." (or click the small arrow icon in the "Font" group on the Home tab) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  In the Format Cells dialog box, navigate to the "Font" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
5.  Check the box next to "Superscript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
6.  Click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Appearance
Although the character might appear normally within the cell's text box while editing, once confirmed, it will display as a superscript within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### In Graphs
This method also applies to text within [[excel_graph_formatting | Excel graphs]], such as units like "kg/mÂ³" where the '3' needs to be a superscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The process is identical: select the number in the graph's text, access "Format Cells", and select "Superscript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Applying Subscript Formatting (Subindices)

Subscripts are characters that appear slightly below the baseline, commonly used in chemical formulas or mathematical notation.

### Steps to Apply
The steps for applying a subscript are similar to those for a superscript:
1.  Double-click the cell and select the desired character(s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  Open the "Format Cells" dialog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
3.  On the "Font" tab, check the box next to "Subscript" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
4.  Click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Appearance
Once applied, the selected character(s) will appear below the baseline in the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Both [[applying_subscript_formatting | subscripts]] and [[applying_superscript_formatting | superscripts]] can be viewed clearly when zoomed in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

This guide outlines the steps to activate and install your electronic DNIe (ID card) on your computer, allowing you to validate and use its digital certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the installation, ensure you have the following:

1.  **DNIe PIN Code**: This code is essential for activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It is typically issued when you receive your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
    *   If you do not have your PIN code, you can obtain it from an automatic machine at the nearest police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. You will need to log in with your ID card to these machines to retrieve the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. For more detailed instructions on [[steps_to_obtain_a_dnie_code | obtaining a DNIe code]], refer to the tutorial linked in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **ID Card Reader**: An electronic ID card reader is required to interact with your DNIe chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A recommended model is available for purchase via a link in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
3.  **Necessary Software Links**: Two primary links are needed for software installation, usually found in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
    *   One from the government headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   One for the electronic signature software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

3.  Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
4.  Under "System type," you will see if your operating system is 64-bit or 32-bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Download Software

Navigate to the provided links and download the correct versions based on your system architecture (Windows 64-bit/32-bit, or Linux/macOS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:

1.  **Electronic Signature Software**: Download the version compatible with your operating system (e.g., Windows 64-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **FNMT Configurator**: Download the latest version of the FNMT configurator (e.g., 1.82 for 64-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Install Software

1.  **Install FNMT Configurator**:
    *   Run the installer for the FNMT configurator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

## [[verification_and_installation_process_for_digital_certificates | Verification and Installation Process for Digital Certificates]]

To confirm your DNIe and reader are working, you can validate the certificate:

1.  Access the verification link provided in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This link is typically associated with the electronic signature or FNMT service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Click on "Validate certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
3.  When prompted, select "Select Certificate" and open the self-signature application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
4.  The self-signature application will read the electronic certificates stored within your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. You will see different certificates associated with your name, such as authentication and signature certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
5.  Choose any certificate (e.g., the DNIe electronic signature certificate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
6.  Enter your secret PIN code when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
7.  A "valid certificate" message should appear, displaying your name, surname, and DNIe information, confirming successful activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

[[how_to_use_google_calendar | Google Calendar]] allows users to organize their schedule and offers flexible options for [[sharing_google_calendar_with_others | sharing the calendar]], either publicly or privately with specific individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Accessing Sharing and Configuration Settings

After [[creating_a_new_google_calendar | creating a new calendar]], such as a "YouTube video tutorials" calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, you can configure its visibility and sharing options. To do this, locate the calendar on the left side of the screen, click the three dots next to its name, and select "configure and share" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Sharing Options

There are two primary ways to share a Google Calendar:

### 1. Public Sharing

To make a calendar accessible to everyone, regardless of whether they have a Gmail account, you can select the option to "Share it publicly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This allows people using various email providers like Yahoo or photomail to view the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This method is useful for calendars with subscribers, or for sending reminders about video uploads or other public events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### 2. Private Sharing with Specific People

If you only want to share the calendar with a select group, choose the option "share with certain people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

To do this:
1.  Click "add people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  Enter the email address of the person you want to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  Assign specific permissions to that individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>:
    *   **See all events**: Allows the person to view all calendar events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   **Make changes**: Grants permission to modify events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   **Administrator privileges**: Gives full control over the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
4.  Once added, the person will receive an invitation to access the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Sharing with Non-Gmail Users Privately

If you wish to share a calendar privately with someone who does not have a Gmail account, the simplest solution is for them to [[creating_a_new_google_calendar | create a Gmail account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This process is quick, usually taking less than five minutes, and enables private sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Calendar Notifications

In addition to sharing, users can [[configuring_notifications_and_events_in_google_calendar | configure notifications]] for their calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Notifications can be set to alert users about events with a specified lead time, such as ten minutes or four hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Other notifications can be configured for various events, including canceled events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These features are valuable for daily organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

When an event is created, such as "video calendar tutorial," on a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, and assigned to a shared calendar (e.g., "YouTube video tutorials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, a notification will be sent to email and/or mobile devices depending on how the recipient has configured their settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

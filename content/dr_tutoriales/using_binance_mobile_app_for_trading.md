## Accessing the Binance Mobile App

To begin [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_phone | buying USDT on the mobile phone]], you must first have the application installed on your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:05">[05:03:05]</a>. Once the application is open, the default view is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Understanding Trading Pairs

When viewing trading pairs, such as BTC/USDT or USDT/BTC, the order of the cryptocurrencies is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>:
*   If USDT appears first (e.g., USDT/Bitcoin), and you click "Buy," you would be buying USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   If the other cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) appears first (e.g., Bitcoin/USDT), and you click "Buy," you would be buying Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Conversely, to acquire USDT in this pair, you would need to "Sell" Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

It is important to always consider which asset appears first when operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.

## Executing a Trade (Example: Selling Bitcoin for USDT)

To [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_Binance | acquire USDT]] by selling another cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, follow these steps:
1.  Select a trading pair where USDT is the second asset (e.g., Bitcoin/USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
2.  Go to the trade interface, which includes a graph and options to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.
3.  Choose the "Sell" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

### Using a Market Order
For immediate execution at the current market price, select a "Market Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>. This means the order will be executed at the price currently available in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.

1.  Input the desired quantity of USDT you wish to acquire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. You can specify the quantity in terms of the base currency (e.g., Bitcoin) or the total value in the quote currency (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
2.  Confirm the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. If you have the necessary amount of the base currency in your [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | spot wallet]], the USDT will be purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Checking Your Wallet

After purchasing USDT, you can check your holdings by going to the "Wallet" section, then selecting the "Spot Wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. The spot wallet is where your purchased cryptocurrencies are stored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Here, you will find the USDT, along with its balance, if the transaction was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

Learn how to create a professional form using Google Forms step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide will cover how to access Google Forms, add various question types, configure form settings, customize its appearance, and share it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Accessing Google Forms

To begin, ensure you are logged into your Google account within Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Navigate to the Google applications icon (usually on the top right) and look for Google Forms. It has a purple logo with "Forms" written on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Starting a New Form

Upon accessing Google Forms, you will see several [[google_forms_templates | templates]] such as "Contact Information," "RSVP," or "Party Invite" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. To learn how to [[creating_a_survey_using_google_forms | create a survey]], start with a blank form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Form Title and Description

Assign a title to your form, for example, "Doubts form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Provide a quick description, such as "This form is used to transmit your doubts to me and see if we can solve them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Adding and Customizing Questions

Google Forms allows you to add various question types and customize their properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Question Types and Examples

*   **Short Answer:** Ideal for brief responses like names or email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
    *   *Example:* "Gmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   **Paragraph:** For longer text responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Explain your doubts" (Google Forms may auto-detect it's a long response based on keywords like "explain") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Multiple Choice:** Allows respondents to select one option from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Select" with options like "You have subscribed to the channel," "You have given Like the video," "No you are interested in my this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This can encourage interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes:** Allows respondents to select multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Dropdown:** Similar to multiple choice but presents options in a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **File Upload:** Enables respondents to upload files, which are stored in Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Upload screenshots if you need it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   You can set a maximum number of files (e.g., one) and a maximum size (e.g., 100MB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   It's important to **not** make file upload mandatory if respondents might not have anything to upload, as it will prevent them from submitting the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Date and Time:** Useful for scheduling or event-related forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Asking "when you could use having a meeting" for consulting businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Linear Scale:** For rating on a numerical scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Satisfaction of the tutorial," rated from "very dissatisfied" (1) to "very satisfied" (5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Making Questions Mandatory

For any question, you can toggle the "mandatory" option to ensure it must be answered before submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This is part of [[mandatory_fields_in_google_forms | setting up mandatory fields in Google Forms]].

### Reordering Questions

You can move questions up or down to organize your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Form Settings and Configuration

Access the "Configuration" tab to adjust various settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   **Turn into a questionnaire:** This option assigns scores and correct answers, but it's not applicable for general feedback forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Responses:**
    *   **Collecting email addresses:** You can choose to automatically collect email addresses of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
    *   **Allow response editing:** Allows users to modify their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Limit to one response per user:** For a form about doubts, it's generally not recommended to limit to one response, as a user might have new questions later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Total size limit of all uploaded files:** You can set a maximum storage limit for all files uploaded to the form (e.g., 1 GB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Presentation:**
    *   **Display progress bar:** Shows respondents their progress through the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
    *   **Random question order:** Not recommended for forms where questions have a logical flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   **Confirmation message:** Customize the message shown after a respondent submits the form (e.g., "Reply sent Correct. Subscribe.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   **Show link to send another response:** Allows users to submit the form multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   **Show results summary:** Displays a summary of responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Defaults:** Adjust default settings for new forms you create, such as whether to collect email addresses by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

## Customizing the Theme

To [[how_to_customize_surveys_in_google_forms | customize surveys]], use the "Customize theme" option to change the header, fonts, and colors of your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. You can add emojis to decorate the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Sending the Form

Once your form is complete, use the "Send" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. These are the [[sharing_and_customization_options_in_google_forms | sharing options]]:

*   **Email:** Invite specific people by email. Be aware that your email address will appear to the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Link:** Generate a shareable link to your form. You can choose to shorten the URL for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This is recommended if you want the survey to be anonymous, as sending by email reveals your address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Embed HTML:** Generate HTML code to embed the form directly into a web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   **Note:** If your form includes a "file upload" question, Google Forms will **not** generate HTML code for embedding. You would need to remove the file upload option to get the embed code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

You can preview your form at any time to see how it looks to respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Mandatory questions are indicated by an asterisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

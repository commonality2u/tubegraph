This article explains how to use a mobile application to reveal and understand the metadata and geolocation information embedded within your photos.

## Introduction
Many digital photos contain hidden information, including the exact location where they were taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This data is part of the photo's metadata, and it can be accessed using specific tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Recommended Application: Xip
To view this information, you will need a mobile phone and a free application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.
1.  **Search**: In the Apple Store, search for "Exif, metadata" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  **Identify**: Look for an orange-colored application named "Xip" which displays "photo, video" and has approximately 153 reviews with a 4.5-star rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  **Download**: Download the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
4.  **Features**: The app is in English and offers both a free and a "Pro" (paid) option; the free option is sufficient for most uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Accessing Photo Data
1.  **Allow Access**: Upon opening the Xip app, you will first need to grant it permission to access your photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Select Photos**: Once access is granted, you can select the photos you wish to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Understanding Photo Metadata
When a photo is selected, the application displays its metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This can include:
*   **Image Size**: Dimensions of the photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Camera Details**: Information about the device and lens used, such as iPhone 11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Geolocation Data**: Longitude and latitude coordinates, which specify the exact location where the photo was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This data can also be edited within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Geolocation Explained
Not all mobile phones have [[enabling_and_disabling_photo_geolocation | geolocation]] activated by default when taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This setting can be controlled through camera permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Some photos will have location data, while others will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

#### Viewing Geolocation on a Map
If a photo has [[enabling_and_disabling_photo_geolocation | geolocation]] enabled, the Xip app allows you to view the exact location on a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This feature is highly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   A photo taken in Bristol, UK, can show its precise location on the map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, including street-level detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   A photo taken at Niagara Falls accurately indicates the location near the Skylon Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, a photo sent by someone who did not have location services enabled will not display any location data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Adding Photos for Analysis
You can upload photos to the Xip app for analysis by clicking the "+" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. After adding a photo, it will display its metadata, including location if available, and camera details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

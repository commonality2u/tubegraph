Screen recording is a versatile technique that can be employed for various purposes, including creating video tutorials or, as detailed in this guide, for [[exporting_videos_without_watermarks | exporting videos without watermarks]] from editing software [00:01:36].

## Bypassing Watermarks with Screen Recording

When [[using_video_editing_software_to_modify_video_content | video editing software]] like [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] is used, directly exporting a video can often result in a watermark [00:01:16]. A method to circumvent this is by screen recording the playback within the editor itself [00:01:36].

### Using [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]] for Screen Recording

[[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]] is a recommended program for screen recording [00:01:26]. It can record the screen and audio simultaneously [00:01:31].

#### Step-by-Step Process:

1.  **Prepare Video in [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]]**: Import and edit the desired video within [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] [00:00:49]. For instance, a video tutorial on disabling Airpod notifications is used as an example [00:00:56]. Once the video is fully edited, it's ready for the next step [00:01:02].
2.  **Open [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]]**: Ensure [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]] is open and ready to record [00:01:26].
3.  **Arrange Screens**: Place [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] on one screen (or maximize its window) and [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]] on another, if possible [00:01:57]. The goal is to make the [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] preview window large enough to be clearly recorded [00:02:30].
4.  **Configure [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]]**: Set [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]] to record the specific screen where [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] is displayed [00:02:22].
5.  **Start Recording and Playback**: Initiate recording in [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]], then play the video within [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] [00:02:45]. [[using_obs_studio_for_screen_recording | OBS Studio]] will capture both the video content and its accompanying sound as it plays [00:03:11].
6.  **Review**: The result is a video file of the [[filmora_10_video_editing_tips | Filmora 10]] playback, without the software's watermark [00:01:39].

This technique allows users to obtain edited video content free of watermarks, effectively bypassing the standard export process of the editing software [00:03:14].

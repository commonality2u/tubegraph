Decentralized Finance (DeFi), also known as Decentralized Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, is a product that allows users to obtain profitability from their cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While it offers the potential for high returns, it is also associated with significant risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Many believe DeFi is the future of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## What is DeFi?

DeFi is inspired by blockchain technology, similar to what underpins Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This technology allows multiple entities to hold a copy of transactions, meaning it is not controlled by a single central source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

On Binance, DeFi products are categorized under "high quality risk products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Binance itself acts as a services platform for these projects, offering "the best mining projects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. However, it does not guarantee that these projects will always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Profitability in DeFi

DeFi offers the potential for very good profitability for cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While the annual percentage yield (APY) can vary, there are times when annual returns can exceed 30% or even 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The APY adjusts daily based on chain rewards, meaning it is a variable, not fixed, value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

Currently available DeFi products on Binance, such as the one for DAI cryptocurrency, offer an 8.79% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Risks in DeFi

DeFi is considered a high-risk product and is not very safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Key risks include:
*   **No Guarantees**: Binance does not guarantee that the projects will always work as intended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
*   **Contract Vulnerability**: Binance is not responsible for losses incurred due to the vulnerability of a project's contract on the corresponding blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Instances exist where projects have disappeared, leading to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Variable Returns**: Profitability is not always positive; sometimes it can be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

It is crucial to be informed about the specific project and cryptocurrency being invested in, and to analyze the returns it offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## How to Engage with DeFi on Binance

To access DeFi products on Binance:
1.  Navigate to the "Earn" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Select "DeFi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Once there, you will see a list of available DeFi products, often with details like:
*   Annual Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Minimum locked amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
*   Subscribe option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>

### Understanding Flexible vs. Locked Staking

DeFi offers two main types of investment durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>:
*   **Flexible Lock**: Allows you to deposit cryptocurrencies and remove them whenever you wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Locked**: Requires your cryptocurrencies to be held for a specific period, typically 7 or 30 days, depending on the selected option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Normally, locking your capital for longer periods yields greater profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Investing in a DeFi Product

1.  Select the desired cryptocurrency and duration (flexible or locked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
2.  Enter the amount you wish to invest, adhering to the specified minimum and maximum limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. These limits can vary based on the duration selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
3.  Review the value date, interest period, interest end date, and refund date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
4.  Accept the user agreement. It is important to read this agreement to understand the terms and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Monitoring DeFi Investments

To view your DeFi investments:
1.  Go to the "Wallet" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
2.  Select the "Earn" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the "DeFi" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
4.  You can then choose to view "flexible" or "blocked" investments to see the cumulative profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Recommendation

It is recommended to try DeFi products with a small amount of capital initially to gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Always prioritize informing yourself and understanding where your money and cryptocurrencies are being placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Depositing funds into your PayPal account from your bank requires linking and verifying your bank account first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This tutorial focuses on how to do this using a computer, but the process is identical on a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Accessing Deposit Options

To begin, ensure you are logged into your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

You can initiate the process in two ways:
*   Go to the "PayPal balance" section and select "Transfer money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Navigate to "My wallet" and click "Transfer Money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Once you select "Transfer money," you will be given options to [[transferring_money_between_a_bank_and_paypal | transfer money]] from PayPal to a bank, or from a bank to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Choose "Add money to your balance PayPal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Crucial Step: Linking Your Bank Account

PayPal will instruct you to "Use a bank account linked to PayPal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. It is critical that your bank account is already linked to your PayPal account before attempting to make a transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. If you try to transfer funds from an unlinked bank account, the transfer will be automatically rejected because PayPal will not recognize the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### The [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | Verification Process for Linking Bank Accounts]]

To link your bank account:
1.  PayPal will initiate a small transfer of a few centimiles (cents) to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  You will then need to confirm the exact amount of this transfer within your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. For example, if PayPal sends one penny, you must confirm that it was one penny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
3.  This linking process typically takes one to two days to complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Once confirmed, your bank account will be linked to your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Depositing Funds After Linking

Once your bank account is successfully linked, you can proceed with depositing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   You will be provided with specific PayPal banking details, including an IBAN and the beneficiary's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   It is important not to put anything in the "concept" or "description" field of your bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   You will receive an email confirmation once the transfer is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   Bank transfers can take one to two business days to reflect in your PayPal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Weekends and holidays are not counted within this timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

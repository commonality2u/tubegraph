This tutorial provides a guide on how to use the futures application on [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] within a mobile device for [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | trading]] with and without leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The aim is to understand important concepts for utilizing and generating [[maximizing_profit_from_cryptocurrency_investments | profitability]] from [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin, users can open the [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] application on their mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Within the bottom menu, locate and select the "Futures" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. It is assumed that users already have a futures account open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Futures Options: USDⓈ-M vs. Coin-M

Inside the futures option, different categories are presented: USDⓈ-M, Coin-M, and Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This tutorial focuses on the USDⓈ-M section, which is the main area for operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **Coin-M:** This section features assets compared to the dollar, such as Bitcoin US permanently or quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **USDⓈ-M:** This is the primary section for [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | trading]], allowing users to filter and select various assets like IOTA/USD for operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Transferring Funds to Futures Account

Before [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | operating]], money must be transferred from the user's Spot wallet to the Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "Wallet" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Futures" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Select the "Transfer" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Avoid "Loan" or "Repayment" options due to associated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
4.  Funds must be transferred in USD, as it is the asset used for exchange with [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | cryptocurrencies]] like Bitcoin/USD, Ethereum/USD, or IOTA/USD within futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
5.  Confirm the transfer to see the USD balance increase in the Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Having the amount in the Futures wallet is crucial for [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | operating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Modifying Margin Mode and Leverage

Once in the Futures section, selecting an asset (e.g., Bitcoin, XRP) is the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Margin Modes: Cross vs. Isolated

A crucial setting to modify is the margin mode:
*   **Cross Mode:** In this mode, all orders under the same asset share the same balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. In case of liquidation, all assets in kind, along with any open positions, can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This means losses from leverage can extend to other wallets if the futures ticket balance is insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   **Isolated Mode:** The margin assigned to a position is restricted to a certain amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If this amount is exceeded, only that specific position is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This mitigates the risk of losing more money than what is in the Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

It is recommended to work in **Isolated Mode** to prevent broader losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Adjusting Leverage

After selecting the margin mode, users can adjust leverage. The default might be "twenty times," but it can be set anywhere up to "seventy-five" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Lowering leverage will also change the maximum position size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A high leverage setting will trigger a warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Placing Market Orders

To place an order, select between "Buy" or "Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. The simplest order type is a "Market" order, which executes immediately at the current [[market_analysis_for_cryptocurrency_trading | market]] price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

1.  Choose the amount of the asset (e.g., XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The maximum amount depends on the available USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
2.  Input the desired quantity. Note that there might be a minimum quantity requirement for an order (e.g., less than five XRP might not be purchasable) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
3.  Click "Buy" or "Sell" to execute the [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## [[managing_cryptocurrency_to_maximize_profits | Managing]] Positions and Order History

After placing an order, its status can be viewed.
*   **Open Orders:** This section displays orders awaiting execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Positions:** For executed orders, this section shows open positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. The "NLP" value indicates the balance of the operation (positive or negative) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Within an open position, leverage can be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Closing a Position:** To close an operation, a "Sell" order can be placed for the full amount of the asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Alternatively, "Close Everything" can be used for residual values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Order History:** Located on the right, this shows completed orders, including both [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | buy]] and [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | sell]] transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Price Awareness:** It is essential to clearly understand and note down the prices and values at which you wish to [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | operate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   **Volatility:** [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | Cryptocurrencies]] are highly volatile assets, requiring constant attention to [[market_analysis_for_cryptocurrency_trading | market]] fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   **Leverage Caution:** Extreme care must be taken with leverage due to the increased risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Platform Preference:** While mobile trading is possible for clear operations, working from a computer is generally recommended for better oversight and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The example provided demonstrated a [[strategic_buying and selling in cryptocurrency markets | market]] purchase within futures with "zero leverage," which is essentially a 1x leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

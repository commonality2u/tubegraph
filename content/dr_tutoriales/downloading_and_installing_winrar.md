WinRAR is a program designed to [[compressing_files_using_winrar | compress]] and decompress files, making it easier to transport them, reduce their size, and send them via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For instance, services like Gmail typically have a 25 megabyte limit for attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, so [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | WinRAR]] helps in sending more files in a single email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## How to Download WinRAR

If you don't already have WinRAR installed, the process is straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>:
1.  Open your preferred search engine, such as Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  In the search bar, type "WinRAR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  The first search result should provide an option to download the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
4.  Proceed to download the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The installation process itself is not detailed in this guide as the presenter already had the software downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. However, it is highly recommended to install it if you need file compression capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Compressing Files with WinRAR

Once WinRAR is installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, you can [[additional_compression_with_windrard | compress]] your desired files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Checking Original File Size

Before compression, it's useful to check the original file size. For example, a video file initially weighed 55.6 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, which is too large to send via Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

To check file size:
1.  Right-click on the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
2.  Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Steps to Compress

1.  Right-click on the file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  From the context menu, select the option with the book icon that says "Add to archive..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This opens the compression settings window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Compression Settings

In the compression settings, you can configure several options:

*   **Archive name**: Choose a name for your compressed file. The `.rar` extension indicates a compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Compression method**: Set this to "Best" for optimal compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Dictionary size**: Set this to the "least possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Split to volumes**: Set this to "0" to keep the file as a single volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Compression options**: Select "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   **Password**: You have the option to set a password for the compressed file for added security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Advanced options**: No changes are typically needed in the "Advanced" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The compression options may vary depending on the source file type; for instance, video files might already be optimized and not offer further compression options through WinRAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

After configuring the settings, click "OK" to start the compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Compression Result

In the example, the video file, which was originally 55.6 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, was compressed to 43.9 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>, resulting in approximately 20% compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> There are other methods for video compression, such as using VLC media player, which can also be very effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

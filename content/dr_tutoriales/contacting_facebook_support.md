To [[contacting_facebook_support | contact Facebook support]], a specific, multi-step process is required, as directly reaching support can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The standard Facebook help link often leads to frequently asked questions and does not provide an immediate option to contact support directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Accessing Business Help Service

To initiate contact, navigate to the [[facebook_business_help_service | Help for businesses service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   If you haven't already, you might need to create a company profile, which can be done quickly using your existing Facebook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
*   Within the business help section, select "First steps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   This section offers options to "find answers" or "Get in Service with the service contact" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   You will then be directed to the "Help Account Overview for businesses," where you can view "Recent Problems" and "Resolved Problems" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Initiating Support Contact

To get help, click the "contact the service" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   When prompted to describe your problem, be cautious, as sometimes selecting a problem will redirect you to another website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Bypass method**: To ensure you can proceed to chat, select the option "I think someone has accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This option allows you to move forward even if it's not the actual issue you need help with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   Provide your company name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, followed by your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### [[providing_information_for_facebook_account_recovery | Providing Information]]

When providing information for your specific issue, such as [[solving_facebook_account_issues | account recovery]]:
*   Clearly state your need, for example, "I need help to recover My Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   For the "Identifier user," copy the current URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Specify the date of any suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Answer questions about detecting suspicious users or advertising accounts with suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   After filling out the necessary information, click "initiate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   You will see an estimated wait time before clicking "Start chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   A [[starting_a_chat_with_facebook_support | Facebook Company Chat]] will open on the right side of your screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

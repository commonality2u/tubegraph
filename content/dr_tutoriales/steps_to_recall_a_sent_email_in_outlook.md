If you've sent an email within Outlook and need to [[how_to_cancel_or_delete_an_email_in_outlook | cancel or delete]] it, Outlook provides a feature for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process allows you to either delete the message entirely from the recipient's mailbox or replace it with a modified version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Prerequisite for Successful Recall

The most crucial condition for a successful email recall is that the recipient **has not opened the message** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the email has already been opened, the recall attempt will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Steps to Recall or Modify a Sent Email

1.  **Locate the Sent Email**: Navigate to your "Sent Messages" folder within Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
2.  **Open the Email**: Click on the specific email you wish to recall or modify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This will open the email in a new window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  **Access Recall Options**: In the email's ribbon, look for a button with a specific symbol (often related to "File" or "Message" tab, then "Actions" or "Move" group, depending on your Outlook version, though the video points to a direct button with a symbol) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Click on this button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
4.  **Choose an Action**: You will be presented with two main options:
    *   **Delete the message completely**: This aims to remove the email from the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Delete and send another modification**: This option allows you to recall the original email and immediately send a revised version in its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For example, if you forgot to include a greeting, you could [[editing_and_modifying_sent_emails_in_outlook | modify]] it and resend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
5.  **Confirmation and Notification**:
    *   You can choose whether Outlook should notify you if the recall or modification was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   If you select to simply delete the message, confirm your choice by clicking "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
6.  **Recall Confirmation**: Outlook will provide a confirmation indicating that you have attempted to recall the message, including the date and time of the attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. You will also receive a confirmation if the email was totally eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

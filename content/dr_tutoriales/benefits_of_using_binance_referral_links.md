Binance offers a referral program that allows users to invite others to the platform and earn commissions, while the invited users receive discounts on their transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system creates a mutual benefit for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## How Binance Referrals Work

The [[how_binance_referrals_work | Binance referral]] system operates on a shared commission model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. When a new user opens an account using a referrer's unique link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, they become an affiliate. Commissions are generated whenever the referred person completes operations such as deposits, transactions, or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Benefits for the Referred User

New users who sign up using a referral link can receive a discount on their transaction commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
For example, a common discount is 10% on commissions whenever they make deposits, operations (trading), or withdraw capital within their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This effectively [[using_discounts_on_binance_to_save_on_transaction_fees | reduces Binance commissions]] for the new user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Benefits for the Referrer

Referrers can earn a commission from the trading fees paid by their invited friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Depending on the referral link configuration, this commission can be up to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For instance, if a referrer gives a 10% discount to the referred user, the referrer typically receives the remaining percentage of the commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
It is recommended to refer people who are likely to make investments or actively use their money to invest cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

Commissions earned by the referrer are paid in the same cryptocurrency that the referred user used for their transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For example, if a referred user buys BNB, the referrer will receive BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This allows referrers to accumulate a diverse range of cryptocurrencies in their wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Setting Up and Managing Referral Links

[[setting_up_and_managing_binance_referral_programs | Managing Binance referral programs]] involves navigating to the "Referral Program" section within your Binance profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

The referral dashboard provides access to:
*   **Control Panel:** Shows earned bitcoins, total transactions made by referrals, and the number of active referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **List of Links:** Allows you to see and manage your created referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Friends List:** Displays users who have signed up with your link, including their user ID, account type (spot, mining, futures), and registration time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. User names are kept private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Commission History:** Provides a detailed history of commissions earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, which can be filtered by account type (e.g., spot, futures, mining) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Shared Commissions:** Shows commissions shared with your referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Customizing Referral Percentages

Users can generate new referral links and choose the percentage split of commissions between themselves and their referred friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
Available options for the referrer's commission share are 0%, 5%, or 10% for the referred user, with the referrer taking the rest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. If the referrer maintains an account balance higher than 500 BNB, they can create links where the referrer takes 15% or 20% commission while the referred person receives 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Accessing Referrals via Mobile App

The referral program can also be accessed through the [[using_binance_referrals_via_mobile_app | Binance mobile app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
To do so, open the Binance app, go to your profile section (usually top-left), and select "Referral Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This will display a menu similar to the desktop version, showing friends who have used the link and transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

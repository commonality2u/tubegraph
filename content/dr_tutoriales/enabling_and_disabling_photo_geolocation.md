This article explains how to determine where a photo was taken, focusing on the use of a free mobile application to view and understand photo geolocation data.

## Finding Photo Locations with the Exif App

To find the location where photos were taken, a free mobile application can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

### Downloading and Opening the App

1.  **Download the Application**: Search for "Exif metadata" in the Apple Store to find an app called "Exif" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This app typically appears as an orange icon with "photo, video" and has good reviews, often around 4.5 stars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The free version of the app is sufficient, though a Pro option exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
2.  **Allow Access**: Upon opening the app, you will need to grant it permission to access your photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Understanding Geolocation Data in Photos

The app displays various [[understanding_photo_metadata_and_geolocation | metadata]] from your photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. It's important to note that not all mobile phones have [[understanding_photo_metadata_and_geolocation | geolocation]] activated by default when photos are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This setting can be adjusted in the phone's permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Some photos may have location data enabled, while others may not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

*   **Example with Geolocation**: A photo of a bear shows a location in Bristol, an English city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Similarly, a photo taken at the Niagara Falls last year also detected its location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, specifically from the Skylum Tower overlooking the falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Another example is a conference photo from Oxford, which shows the location as Mansfield College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Example without Geolocation**: A photo received from someone else, taken during a lecture in Switzerland, did not display any location data because the sender did not have location enabled when the photo was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. There was no [[understanding_photo_metadata_and_geolocation | metadata]] or information present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

### Viewing Photo Details and Location

When you select a photo with [[understanding_photo_metadata_and_geolocation | geolocation]] enabled, the app displays:
*   Image size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Opening details (e.g., camera used) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Lens information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Longitude and latitude, which are the coordinates of the photo's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Camera details, including the iPhone model used (e.g., iPhone 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

You can also click on the map within the app to see the exact location where the photo was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The app allows for [[analyzing_and_editing_photo_metadata | editing photo metadata]], including location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Importing Photos into the App

To analyze a photo, select it within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. You can add new photos by tapping the plus button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Once added, the app will display the location and camera details if available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

This tutorial demonstrates how to reduce the file size of PDF documents, making them easier to send via platforms like WhatsApp or email, and saving space on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Checking Initial PDF Size

Before compressing, you can check the original size of your PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
1.  Right-click on the PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   For example, a PDF file named "Fati Case Stadis" was initially found to be approximately 7.82 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Compressing PDFs with I Love PDF

[[using_i_love_pdf_for_file_compression | I Love PDF]] is an online tool that offers various [[pdf_compression_techniques | PDF compression techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

1.  **Access the Website**: Go to the [[using_i_love_pdf_for_file_compression | I Love PDF]] website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The link can typically be found in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  **Select Compress PDF**: Once on the [[using_i_love_pdf_for_file_compression | I Love PDF]] page, navigate to the "Compress PDF" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   The website also provides other functions like [[merging_pdf_files | merging PDF]] files or [[using_pdf_tools_to_split_pdf_documents | splitting PDFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  **Choose Your PDF File**: Click to select the PDF file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Locate and open your PDF document (e.g., "Fatic Case Stady" from the desktop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Understanding Compression Options and Quality

[[using_i_love_pdf_for_file_compression | I Love PDF]] offers different compression levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
*   **Extreme Compression**: Achieves the smallest file size but will result in the most significant reduction in [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Recommended Compression**: Balances file size reduction with [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Low Compression**: Offers the least reduction in file size but maintains higher [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> The more you compress a file, the less [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] it will have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This is because compression involves sacrificing factors like the [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] of images, videos, and text within the PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

This concept is similar to [[how_to_compress_files_with_winrar | compressing with WinRAR]], where extreme compression also impacts [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. A separate tutorial on [[how_to_compress_files_with_winrar | how to compress files with WinRAR]] is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Performing the Compression

1.  **Select Recommended Compression**: For a good balance, choose the "Recommended" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Compression**: Click "Compress PDF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
3.  **Monitor Progress**: The website will show the upload progress and estimated time remaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Reviewing the Compressed PDF

Once the compression is complete, the website will display the reduction achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   In the example, a 7.82 MB file was reduced to 1.76 MB, achieving a 78% reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
    *   This compressed file can be downloaded automatically or by clicking to download again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

To verify the compressed file:
1.  Open the newly downloaded PDF. In the example, minimal [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] loss was observed since the original document was primarily text with some images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  Check the file size in your downloads folder by right-clicking and selecting "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The example showed the new file size as 1.75 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

This method allows you to compress a PDF by up to 75% or more, depending on the chosen [[effects_of_compression_on_pdf_quality | quality]] setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Even greater reduction is possible by choosing "Extreme Compression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

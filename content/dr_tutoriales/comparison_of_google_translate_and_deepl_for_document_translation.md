This article explores various [[methods_to_translate_pdfs_from_english_to_spanish | methods to translate PDFs]], with a specific focus on comparing two popular [[online_tools_for_translating_pdfs | online tools for translating PDFs]]: Google Translate and DeepL. Before delving into the tools, it's crucial to understand a key prerequisite for successful PDF translation.

## Important Prerequisite for PDF Translation

For any of the translation methods to work, the PDF document must recognize its content as editable text, not as a scanned image [00:00:43]. If a PDF is a scanned page, it is essentially in image format [00:00:56], and direct translation tools will not work. To translate scanned documents, the image would first need to be transformed into text format [00:01:00]. The methods discussed here are designed for PDFs that are already in text format [00:01:04].

## Method 1: [[using_microsoft_word_for_pdf_translation | Using Microsoft Word for PDF Translation]]

One initial method for translating PDFs involves opening them directly with Microsoft Word [00:01:18]. This process converts the PDF into an editable Word document [00:01:34].

Once in Word:
1.  Select the text you wish to translate (e.g., an abstract of a scientific paper) [00:01:49].
2.  Right-click the selected text [00:01:51].
3.  Choose the "Translate" option [00:01:53].
4.  Specify the target language (e.g., Spanish) [00:02:04].
5.  Click "Insert" to replace the original text with the translation [00:02:17].

This method allows for translation of individual paragraphs or the entire document by selecting all text [00:02:23]. After translation, the document can be saved as a Word file [00:02:38].

## Method 2: [[online_tools_for_translating_pdfs | Online Translators]]

After converting the PDF to a Word format (or starting with a text-based PDF), [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | online translators]] can be used. These tools are typically accessed via web browsers like [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] [00:02:51].

### Google Translate

Google Translate offers a document translation feature:
*   **Access**: Navigate to the "documents" section of Google Translate [00:03:17].
*   **Accepted Formats**: It accepts various document types, including Word, PowerPoint, and PDF files [00:03:26].
*   **Process**: Users can explore their computer to select the desired PDF or Word file [00:03:30] and then click "Translate" [00:03:37].
*   **Outcome**: Google Translate processes the file and provides a downloadable translated version [00:04:09]. The service is described as completely free and does not require a "Pro" subscription [00:05:08].

### DeepL Translator

DeepL is another online document translator:
*   **Access**: Similar to Google Translate, it can be accessed online [00:03:46].
*   **Accepted Formats**: It also supports PDF, DOC, and PPTX files [00:03:49].
*   **Process**: Users select a file from their computer and initiate the translation [00:03:51]. Users can choose the target language, such as Spanish [00:04:36].
*   **Outcome and Limitations**: While it performs the translation, DeepL has a character limit for its free service [00:04:56]. For longer documents, it prompts users to subscribe to DeepL Pro [00:04:52], which is a paid service [00:05:02].

## Comparison Summary

*   **Google Translate**: Appears to be a completely free service for document translation, handling files like Word and PDF without character limits or prompting for paid subscriptions [00:05:08].
*   **DeepL Translator**: Offers high-quality translations but has a character limit for its free document translation service, requiring a DeepL Pro subscription for longer documents [00:04:56].

In conclusion, for completely free and unlimited document translation, Google Translate is highlighted as a robust option [00:05:11]. DeepL, while effective, introduces limitations that may require a paid upgrade for extensive use [00:05:02].

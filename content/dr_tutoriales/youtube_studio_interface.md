The [[youtube_studio_navigation|YouTube Studio]] interface is a platform for content creators to manage their YouTube channels and videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. It allows creators to upload and manage videos, and access various settings that affect channel and video behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Activating Comments via YouTube Studio

The [[youtube_studio_navigation|YouTube Studio]] is crucial for enabling comments on videos, which is important for [[promoting_interaction_and_engagement_on_youtube|interaction and engagement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Greater interaction, even from negative comments, can help position videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. To activate comments, three main considerations must be addressed within the [[youtube_studio_navigation|YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### General Channel Settings

The first step is to navigate to "Configuration" within the [[youtube_studio_navigation|YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. From there, select "Channel" and then "Advanced Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. To ensure comments are active across all videos, the channel must be marked as "not created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. If a channel is designated for children, comments will be universally banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Individual Video Settings

The second consideration involves settings for individual videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. For a specific video, access its "Details" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Similar to channel settings, if the video is marked as "content created for children," YouTube will automatically block all comments for that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Therefore, it should be marked as "not content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Advanced Comment Settings

Even if a video is not designated for children, comments can still be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The third consideration requires going to "More Options" within the video's details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Scroll down to the "Comments and ratings" section and select "Allow all comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Options exist to disable comments or prevent them from being read, but choosing "Allow all comments" ensures [[promoting_interaction_and_engagement_on_youtube|interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Creators can manually delete inappropriate comments after they are posted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

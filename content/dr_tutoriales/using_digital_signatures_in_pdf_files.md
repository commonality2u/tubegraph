This article outlines the process of [[how_to_insert_a_signature_in_a_pdf_document | how to insert a signature in a PDF document]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, focusing on [[adding_signatures_to_pdfs | adding signatures to PDFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Preparing Your Signature

Before you begin, you will need a PDF file and a signature image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
For privacy reasons, it is advisable not to use your actual signature for demonstration purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

For personal use, there are various [[techniques_to_scan_and_add_signatures_to_pdfs | techniques to scan and add signatures to PDFs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, including:
*   Scanning your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Taking a photo of your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Downloading a signature image from the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Once you have your signature, transfer the image to your computer to be able to paste it directly into the PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## [[steps_to_fill_out_and_sign_pdf_documents | Steps to Fill Out and Sign PDF Documents]]

To insert your signature into a PDF document:

1.  **Open the PDF File**: Begin by opening the PDF document you wish to sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Access Signing Options**: After opening the PDF, navigate to the "Fill out and sign" option, typically found on the right-hand side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This option allows you to fill, sign, and send documents, or obtain signatures from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Signing**: Click on "Fill and sign" to proceed with signing the document yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
4.  **Position Your Signature**: Scroll to the desired location within the document where you want to place your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
5.  **Choose Signature Type**: You have several [[options_for_signing_pdfs_including_text_and_image_signatures | options for signing PDFs including text and image signatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
    *   **Text Signature**: You can directly type text (e.g., "subscribe") into the document. This can be customized with various fonts and styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   **Drawn Signature**: You can draw your signature using your mouse or a stylus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   **Image Signature**: This method involves including a scanned or photographed signature image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
6.  **Add an Image Signature**:
    *   Click "Sign" at the top right of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Select "Add a signature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
    *   Choose an image file from your computer (e.g., your desktop) that contains your signature in image format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Once inserted, you can freely move, resize (make it bigger or smaller), and position the signature within the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Saving the Signed Document

After placing the signature:

1.  **Save the File**: Go to "File" and select "Save as" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  **Name the File**: Give the signed PDF a new name, for example, "Document_Signed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
3.  **Confirm Save**: Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

You will now have two PDF files: the original unsigned document and the newly signed version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Opening the signed file will display your embedded signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

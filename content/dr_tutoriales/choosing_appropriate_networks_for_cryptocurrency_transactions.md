When performing [[sending_receiving_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrency transactions]], particularly deposits and withdrawals, selecting the correct blockchain network is critical to ensure your funds reach their intended destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This choice affects not only the success of the transfer but also the associated [[transaction_fees_and_network_selection_for_cryptocurrency_transfers | transaction fees]] and processing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Network Selection for Deposits

When depositing cryptocurrencies onto a platform like Binance, you must choose the blockchain network from which the deposit is originating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. For example, if you are depositing USDT, you might have options like "ERC-20" or "BEP-20" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. Each network will have its own unique deposit address and potentially different average arrival times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### The Importance of Matching Networks

It is crucial that the network selected on the receiving platform matches the network used by the sending platform or wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. If, for instance, a deposit order is initiated using the ERC-20 network, but the receiving platform is configured for BEP-20, the cryptocurrency will "fly around in the blockchain network" and never reach its destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

The sending party must inform you which network they are using (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Depending on the chosen network, a different deposit address (code) will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Failure to input the correct matching code will result in the permanent loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Network Selection for Withdrawals

Similarly, when withdrawing cryptocurrencies to another wallet or platform, you will need to select the appropriate network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This choice directly impacts the [[transaction_fees_and_network_selection_for_cryptocurrency_transfers | commissions]] charged by the network for processing the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Some networks may incur higher fees than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Always ensure the withdrawal network matches the deposit network of the receiving wallet to prevent loss of funds.

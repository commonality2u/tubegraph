Trust Wallet incorporates several security and privacy measures to help users protect their digital assets and personal information. Understanding these features is crucial for secure cryptocurrency management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Wallet Security

Upon first use, Trust Wallet guides users through essential security steps:
*   **Privacy Policy Acceptance** Users are required to accept the privacy policy before proceeding with wallet creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   **Access Code/Password** An access code or password must be set up and re-entered to secure access to the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Security Copy/Backup** The application prompts users to make a copy of their wallet's security information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Protecting Your Recovery Phrase

A critical component of Trust Wallet security is the 12-word secret phrase (also known as a recovery or seed phrase). This phrase serves as the master key to your funds:
*   **Irrecoverable Funds** If you lose this secret phrase, you will lose access to your funds permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **Risk of Theft** Sharing or exposing your secret phrase can lead to your funds being stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **User Responsibility** Trust Wallet is not responsible for lost funds due to users losing their secret phrase or exposing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Privacy** The secret phrase is censored within the application for [[privacy_and_security_in_ios | privacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Recommended Storage for Your Recovery Phrase
It is highly recommended to copy your secret phrase to a physical paper rather than storing it digitally on a PC, as PCs are vulnerable to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Storing it on physical paper reduces the risk of digital compromise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

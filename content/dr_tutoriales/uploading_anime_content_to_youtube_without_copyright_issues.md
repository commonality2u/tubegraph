Uploading fragments of series, chapters, or films, especially anime, to YouTube can lead to videos being banned or blocked from public view due to copyright infringement [00:00:21][00:00:25][00:00:28][00:00:30][00:00:33][00:00:36][00:00:39][00:00:47]. This often occurs because of copied audio (music, voices) or images within the content [00:00:28][00:00:30][00:00:33]. While some videos might be monetized, others face complete bans [00:00:42][00:00:45][00:00:47].

To avoid these issues, it is essential to edit the content [00:00:50][00:00:54]. The video demonstrates [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | techniques for uploading edited anime content successfully]] using the Filmora video editing program [00:01:19][00:01:20][00:01:22][00:01:24].

## Editing Strategies to Bypass Copyright

Effective [[editing_audio_and_video_to_bypass_copyright_detection | editing audio and video to bypass copyright detection]] is crucial. The following [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_bans_on_anime_uploads | strategies for avoiding YouTube bans on anime uploads]] are suggested:

### 1. Image Modification

Modifying the video's image makes it harder for YouTube's copyright detection system to track the content [00:02:25][00:02:53][00:04:07][00:04:09][00:04:12][00:04:15][00:04:17].

*   **Channel Logo:** Place your channel's logo consistently throughout the entire video [00:02:08][00:02:10][00:02:11][00:02:15][00:02:17][00:02:20][00:02:22][00:02:29][00:02:32][00:02:35][00:02:40][00:02:43][00:02:46][00:02:48].
*   **Light Leak Effect:** Add a light leak effect using Filmora's built-in effects to subtly alter the visual appearance [00:03:00][00:03:03][00:03:05][00:03:08][00:03:09][00:03:11][00:03:20][00:03:22].
*   **Borders:** Apply a border around the video, leaving a blurred effect. This can be customized (e.g., blue below, white above) and helps modify the video's size and presentation [00:03:30][00:03:32][00:03:35][00:03:38][00:03:42][00:03:46][00:03:48][00:03:50][00:03:53][00:03:57][00:04:00][00:04:02][00:04:04][00:04:07].

### 2. Audio Modification

Altering the video's audio is also essential to prevent copyright detection [00:04:20][00:04:22][00:05:10][00:05:12].

*   **Volume Adjustment:** When importing a video into Filmora, the default audio volume is often at zero [00:04:25][00:04:27][00:04:35][00:04:40][00:04:44]. Slightly lower the original video's volume from this default setting [00:04:46][00:04:48]. While viewers might need to raise their volume on YouTube, this prevents YouTube from detecting audio peaks and flagging the content [00:04:51][00:04:52][00:04:54][00:04:57][00:05:01][00:05:04][00:05:07].

## Exporting and Uploading the Video

Once the video and audio modifications are complete, the video is ready for export [00:05:15][00:05:16][00:05:18][00:05:20][00:05:25][00:05:28].

1.  **Export:** Export the edited video from Filmora.
2.  **Upload to YouTube:**
    *   Navigate to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]].
    *   Select "Create" and then "Upload videos" [00:05:52][00:05:56].
    *   Choose the edited video file [00:05:58][00:05:59][00:06:02].
    *   Proceed through the upload steps, setting audience details [00:06:06].
    *   The video will process [00:06:44][00:06:50].
    *   After processing, check for any issues or restrictions. If edited correctly, the video should have public visibility and no restrictions [00:06:50][00:06:53][00:06:57][00:07:00][00:07:05][00:07:11][00:07:14].

This method aims to ensure [[video_visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | video visibility and copyright considerations on YouTube]] are met, allowing the content to be uploaded without being banned [00:06:41][00:06:44][00:06:50][00:06:53][00:07:11][00:07:14].

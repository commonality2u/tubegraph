Phone number verification is a necessary step for YouTube channel owners to unlock specific features beyond the basic functionalities of a newly created account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This process enables creators to upload longer videos and access other important features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Why Verify Your Phone Number?

When a new [[registering_and_logging_into_youtube_account | YouTube account]] is created, the platform initially restricts the upload of videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. [[youtube_account_verification | Verifying your YouTube account]] with a phone number lifts this restriction and enables additional features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Key features requiring phone verification include:
*   Uploading videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
*   Using custom thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Starting live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

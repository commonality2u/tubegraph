By default, YouTube channels may not be able to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. If this permission is not enabled, attempts to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload longer videos]] may result in the video being blocked or stuck at 99% processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is a permission that new channels need to enable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Enabling Longer Video Uploads

To enable the ability to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos longer than 15 minutes]], follow these steps:

1.  **Access YouTube Studio**: Navigate to the [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] for the channel you wish to update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Switch to Classic Version**: Within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], switch to the "classic version" as this allows for faster access to the necessary settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
3.  **Go to Channel Settings**: Once in the classic version, click on the "channel" option located in the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  **Locate "Longer Videos"**: In the channel settings, you will find various options and permissions for your channel. Identify the section related to "longer lasting victims" (interpreted as "longer videos") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This window controls the ability to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos exceeding fifteen minutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
5.  **Verify Status**: For channels where this feature is not yet enabled, it will typically display "No" or indicate that it is not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Verification Process

To activate the permission for [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | longer video uploads]], you will need to undergo a [[verification_process_for_uploading_longer_videos | verification process]] to confirm that the YouTube account belongs to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Steps for Verification

1.  **Initiate Verification**: Access the "longer videos" section and proceed with the verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
2.  **Receive Confirmation Code**: YouTube will send a confirmation code to your registered mobile phone, Gmail, or email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
3.  **Enter Code**: Use this confirmation code to complete the verification process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Once this [[verification_process_for_uploading_longer_videos | verification process]] is successfully completed and the permission is enabled, you will be able to [[enabling_longer_video_uploads_in_youtube_studio | upload videos longer than fifteen minutes]] without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

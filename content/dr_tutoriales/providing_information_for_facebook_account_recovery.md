[[contacting_facebook_support | Contacting Facebook support]] can be a complicated process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. While direct Facebook help links often redirect to general questions and don't allow direct support contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, there is a workaround to initiate a chat with a support agent.

## Accessing Support Through Business Help Service

To get around the difficulty of directly contacting support, you can utilize the [[facebook_business_help_service | Help for businesses]] service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   If you haven't already, you can quickly create a company profile using your existing Facebook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   Once in the [[facebook_business_help_service | Help Account Overview for businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, navigate to "First steps" or "Get in Service with the service contact of attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Avoid selecting other listed options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Look for the option "If I need them Help" to [[contacting_facebook_support | contact the service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Submitting a Problem to Initiate Chat

When prompted to describe your problem, be aware that many issue submissions might redirect you to another website instead of allowing direct contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. To circumvent this, it's recommended to select a specific type of problem that will reliably lead to a chat option:
*   Choose the option "I think someone You have accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if this isn't your exact issue, it's a method to open a chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. You can explain your true problem to the support agent later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

When looking to withdraw capital from cryptocurrency platforms like KuCoin into a traditional bank account, it's often necessary to use an intermediary platform. This process allows users to convert their digital assets into national currencies (fiat) and transfer them to their bank. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>

## Why Use an Intermediary Platform?

Platforms like KuCoin may not offer direct withdrawal options for national currencies (fiat) such as euros, dollars, or pounds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> While KuCoin allows deposits of fiat currencies, an intermediary company handles these deposits but does not perform the same function for withdrawals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> Therefore, to [[understanding_cryptocurrency_withdrawal_processes | withdraw earnings]] or needed funds, users must first [[transferring_cryptocurrency_between_platforms | transfer their cryptocurrency]] from KuCoin to another platform that supports fiat withdrawals. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

## Withdrawal Process via Kraken

The general process for withdrawing capital from KuCoin using a third-party platform like [[using_kraken_for_cryptocurrency_conversion | Kraken]] involves several steps:

### 1. Transfer Cryptocurrency from KuCoin

*   **Access Assets:** On KuCoin, navigate to the "Assets" section to view your portfolios (e.g., main account, trading account). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   **Initiate Withdrawal:** Select the "Withdraw" option. KuCoin will only allow withdrawals of cryptocurrencies, not national currencies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>
*   **[[cryptocurrency_selection_for_withdrawal | Choose a Cryptocurrency]]:** Select a cryptocurrency with relatively low blockchain transaction fees. For example, USDT (Tether) on the TRC20 network is suggested due to its low commission fees (e.g., 1 USDT) compared to networks like ERC20 (which can charge $20-$25). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>
*   **Obtain Deposit Address from Kraken:** On the [[using_kraken_for_cryptocurrency_conversion | Kraken]] platform, go to "Funds" and select the desired cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT). Choose "Deposit" to generate a unique wallet address for that cryptocurrency on Kraken. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>
*   **Paste Address and Confirm:** Copy the Kraken deposit address and paste it into the withdrawal field on KuCoin. Enter the amount to withdraw and confirm the transaction, including any trading codes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a> The transaction status can be checked in KuCoin's withdrawal history. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>

*   **Consider Kraken Pro:** For larger amounts, using Kraken Pro might be more cost-effective due to lower transaction commissions, and then transferring back to standard [[using_kraken_for_cryptocurrency_conversion | Kraken]] for withdrawal. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>

*   **Add Bank Account:** You will need to add your bank account details. Withdrawal options might include wire transfer (SEPA, SWIFT) or card. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>

### [[choosing_a_compatible_bank_for_withdrawals_from_exchanges | Choosing a Compatible Bank]]

It is crucial to note that some conventional banks (e.g., Santander, BBVA, ING) may block or experience issues with transactions originating from crypto exchanges. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> In such cases, the money may be returned to the exchange platform. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>

For smoother withdrawals, it is recommended to use [[using_neobanks_like_revolut_and_n26_for_crypto_withdrawals | neobanks]] such as:
*   **N26** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
*   **Revolut** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
*   **Living** (likely a specific neobank) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

These [[using_neobanks_like_revolut_and_n26_for_crypto_withdrawals | neobanks]] are typically free to open and are more compatible with crypto exchange transactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>

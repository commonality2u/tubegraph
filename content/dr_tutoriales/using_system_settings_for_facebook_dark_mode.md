[[how to activate dark mode on Facebook | Setting dark mode]] within the Facebook application on a mobile phone offers several options, including one that synchronizes with your device's system settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Accessing Dark Mode Settings

To begin, ensure you have the Facebook application [[facebook_application_setup_on_mobile_phones | downloaded]] and [[updating_facebook_app_on_iphone_and_android | updated]] to the latest version on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. This process works for both iPhone and Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

1.  Open the Facebook application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the three lines icon located in the bottom right corner of the menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
3.  Within the "Configuration and privacy" section, find the "Dark Mode" option, which is represented by a moon icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
4.  Click on the "Dark Mode" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## The "System" Option

Among the [[adjusting_dark_mode_preferences_in_facebook | three options]] available for dark mode, the "System" option is typically selected by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

*   When "System" is chosen, Facebook will automatically adjust its appearance to match your mobile device's system-wide display settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
*   For example, if your mobile phone is set to dark mode, Facebook will also display in dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, if your mobile is set to a bright or white mode, Facebook will revert from dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   This option ensures consistency across all applications that support system-wide dark mode settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

### Other Dark Mode Options

While the "System" option provides dynamic adjustment, you can also [[adjusting_dark_mode_preferences_in_facebook | deactivate]] dark mode to always view Facebook in white mode, or [[how to activate dark mode on Facebook | activate]] it to always view Facebook in dark mode, regardless of your device's system settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Note on Dark Mode Appearance

It's important to note that Facebook's "dark mode" is not a pure black, but rather a shade of gray, slightly lighter than a true dark black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

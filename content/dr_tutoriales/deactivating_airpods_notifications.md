This guide explains how to manage and deactivate notifications from your mobile phone that are read aloud by your [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods notifications]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Accessing Notification Settings

To begin, you will need to access the settings on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, specifically where your AirPods are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the [[iphone_settings_for_airpods | Settings of your iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Locate and select the "Notifications" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   If you cannot immediately find it, use the search bar at the top of the settings menu and type "notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Managing Siri Announce Notifications

Within the Notifications section, you will find settings related to how Siri announces notifications.

1.  Scroll down to find "[[managing_app_notifications_with_siri | Siri, Announce Notifications]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Tap on "Announce Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  Here, you will see an option to either activate or deactivate the "Announce Notifications" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
4.  To stop notifications from being read aloud by your AirPods, toggle the setting off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This will prevent your iPhone from audibly reading notifications through your headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   If you wish to re-enable them, simply toggle the option back on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Customizing App Notifications

You can also [[customizing_notification_preferences | choose which specific apps notify you]] via Siri when wearing your headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

*   Even if the general "Announce Notifications" setting is active, you can individually configure apps to prevent their notifications from being announced through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   To stop an app from announcing notifications, adjust its specific setting within the list of applications below the main "Announce Notifications" toggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This will stop the [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods notifications]] for that particular application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## How to Deactivate Siri Notification Announcements

To prevent notifications from being read aloud by Siri when you are using your AirPods, follow these steps:

1.  Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the **Notifications** section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If you cannot find it, you can use the search bar within Settings by typing "Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  Within the Notifications settings, locate and tap on **Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This setting is usually found under the "Siri" sub-section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
4.  Here, you will see an option to activate or deactivate the announcement of notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
5.  To deactivate, toggle off the option that announces notifications when you have headphones on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Turning this off will stop Siri from reading your notifications aloud through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Customizing Notifications for Specific Apps

In addition to deactivating all notification announcements via AirPods, you can also [[selecting_specific_apps_for_siri_notification_announcements | choose which specific apps Siri announces notifications for]] when your headphones are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Even if the general "Announce Notifications" setting for headphones is active, you can individually manage apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

To stop announcements from a particular application:
*   Within the **Announce Notifications** settings, scroll down to see a list of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Select the desired app and toggle its setting to prevent Siri from announcing its notifications through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

This article provides a guide on how to apply superscripts (superindices) and subscripts (subindices) to text within Microsoft Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The demonstration uses an Excel document from a past degree project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Traditional Indications vs. Proper Formatting

Traditionally, people might indicate superscripts with an upward arrow or subscripts with a downward arrow next to the number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. While this might be seen in [[copying_transcribed_text_to_word | Word]] documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, Excel offers a dedicated [[formatting_text_in_excel | formatting]] option.

## Step-by-Step Guide to Applying Superscripts

To apply a superscript in Excel:
1.  Select the character (e.g., '3') that you want to elevate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Home" tab and locate the "Font" group. Click the small arrow in the bottom-right corner of this group to open the "Format Cells" dialog box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  Within the "Format Cells" dialog box, go to the "Font" tab.
4.  Under "Effects," check the "Superscript" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
5.  Click "OK." The selected character will now appear as a superscript in the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
6.  To return to normal text entry, ensure that the "Superscript" option is deselected when typing subsequent characters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Even if the text appears standard in the input bar, it will be displayed as a superscript in the actual cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Applying Subscripts

The process for [[using_subscripts_in_excel | applying a subscript]] is very similar:
1.  Select the character you wish to format as a subscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  Open the "Format Cells" dialog box by clicking the small arrow in the "Font" group on the "Home" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  On the "Font" tab, under "Effects," check the "Subscript" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
4.  Click "OK." The character will now appear below the baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

After applying both, you can visually compare the superscript and subscript formatting within your Excel sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

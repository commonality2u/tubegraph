The [[Binance]] Visa card offers users the ability to receive refunds on payments, effectively helping to reduce overall [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] and improve the user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## How it Works

When payments are made using the [[Binance]] card, users can receive a refund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. The percentage of this refund is directly tied to the amount of BNB (Binance Coin) a user holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For instance, holding 10 BNB can result in a 2% refund on all payments made with the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Benefits

The primary benefit of using the [[Binance]] card is the cashback feature, which essentially acts as a discount on spending, contributing to overall savings on transaction costs. This mechanism allows users to receive a portion of their spending back, based on their BNB holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Future Information

Further tutorials will be made available to explain the process of creating and utilizing the [[Binance]] Visa card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

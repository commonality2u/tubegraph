N26 is a bank designed to simplify financial operations, especially for international transactions, by offering commission-free services [00:00:29]. The bank aims to provide an easier, more efficient, and useful banking experience through its mobile application [00:00:10].

## Getting Started with N26

Before using the app, it's recommended to watch a tutorial on [[how_to_create_and_manage_an_n26_account | how to create an N26 account]] [00:00:25]. Users can receive a five-euro bonus by using a referral code when opening an account [00:00:55].

The [[navigating_the_n26_app_for_basic_operations | N26 application]] is consistent across both iPhone and Android devices [00:01:19].

## N26 Account Types

N26 offers different account types:
*   **Standard Account** This is a free basic account with no monthly fees [00:01:54].
*   **Premium Accounts** Other account types, such as N26 Metal and N26 You, are available for a monthly fee and offer additional features like unlimited withdrawals and more "spaces" for organization [00:02:01]. N26 Metal, for example, costs seventeen euros a month [00:14:21].

## Navigating the N26 App

The [[navigating_the_n26_app_for_basic_operations | N26 app]] features two main menus:
*   **Lower Menu** Includes "Home," "Spaces," "Exploring," and "Cards" [00:01:45].
*   **Upper Menu** Provides options to view your profile, access help, check statistics/upcoming payments/statements, and search transactions [00:02:15].

### Profile Management
The profile section displays your account details, including your IBAN and a [[using_qr_codes_and_instant_transfers_with_n26 | QR code]] for instant transactions [00:02:39]. Users can activate visibility to allow others to send money instantly via QR code, phone number, or email, similar to common mobile transfer concepts [00:02:50]. This section also allows you to manage personal information, application settings, and security features like changing your PIN or password [00:03:48].

N26 provides an option to manage a "bank change" for users who wish to transfer addresses and payments from an existing bank to their N26 account [00:04:27]. However, many users, particularly for international transactions, may choose to keep their national bank and use N26 as an intermediary for free international transfers [00:04:51].

### Help and Support
The "Questions" section provides access to help resources, including a chat feature where you can interact with a robot that may escalate to a physical person [00:05:05].

### Transactions and Balance
The app allows users to view their current balance, which can be made visible or invisible [00:06:05]. It also provides options to receive and send money, view upcoming payments, and access statistics [00:06:14].

## Managing Funds and Cards

### Receiving Money
Funds can be received via bank transfer, debit or credit card, or by requesting money using a [[using_qr_codes_and_instant_transfers_with_n26 | QR code]] [00:06:26].

### Sending Money
Users can send money through various methods:
*   **Monet Bim** For instant transfers to other N26 account holders [00:06:46].
*   **Bank Transfer** Completely free [00:06:51].
*   **Foreign Currency Transfer** Also free [00:06:54].
*   **Scan QR Code** To send money by scanning a [[using_qr_codes_and_instant_transfers_with_n26 | QR code]] [00:06:57].
*   **Donations** The app also includes an option to donate to Women for Women International [00:07:00].

### Adding Funds
A minimum of ten euros is required in your account for a physical card to be issued [00:07:08]. The first deposit into an N26 account using a credit or debit card is free [00:07:41]. This allows users to deposit funds to activate card features [00:07:47].

### Card Features
N26 provides both virtual and physical cards:
*   **Virtual Card** An active virtual card is immediately available and can be added to mobile wallets like Apple Wallet or Android Pay for immediate mobile payments, even before receiving a physical card [00:10:25].
*   **Physical Card** After an initial deposit, users can request a physical card, which costs ten euros for normal delivery (two weeks) or a higher fee for express delivery (three days) [00:08:37]. The card chosen depends on the account type (e.g., transparent card for the free standard account) [00:08:52].

Users can manage their cards by activating or deactivating them, viewing information, or locking them [00:11:57]. The standard account offers free withdrawals, though the number may be limited compared to premium accounts [00:12:07].

## Spaces and Offers

### Spaces
The "Spaces" feature allows users to create subaccounts to organize their money, set savings goals, and diversify their finances (e.g., a space for savings, another for spending) [00:12:50]. This feature is typically a premium offering, with standard accounts receiving a 59 to 60-day trial period [00:12:57].

### Explore
The "Explore" section displays various offers and promotions, such as discounts on brands like Reebok [00:14:51]. More exclusive offers are available for users with a Premium Plan [00:15:01].

N26 is presented as a valuable tool for optimizing personal finances, especially for international transactions, due to its low costs and comprehensive mobile features [00:15:18].

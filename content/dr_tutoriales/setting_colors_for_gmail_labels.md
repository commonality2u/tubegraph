[[Organizing Gmail inbox with labels | Organizing emails in Gmail]] can be further enhanced by applying colors to your labels, making it easier to distinguish them at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## How to Set Label Colors

To assign a color to a [[creating_labels_in_gmail | Gmail label]]:
1.  Navigate to the [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | labels]] section within your Gmail settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
2.  Locate the desired label (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
3.  Choose a color for that label. For instance, the "YouTube" label can be set to red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
4.  Optionally, apply the same color to any [[using_sublabels_in_gmail_for_better_organization | sub-labels]] (e.g., "subscriptions" and "comments" within "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Visualizing Colored Labels

Once colors are applied, emails associated with these labels will appear in the chosen color in your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. For example, all emails related to "subscriptions" and "YouTube" will appear in red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

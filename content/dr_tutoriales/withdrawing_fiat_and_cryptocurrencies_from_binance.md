## Accessing Withdrawal Options

Within the Binance platform, navigate to the "Wallet" section and select "Overview". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> Here, you will find options for [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | deposit]], withdraw, or transfer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> The transfer option is for internal movements within Binance wallets, while "withdraw" is for external transfers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

## Withdrawing Cryptocurrencies

To withdraw cryptocurrencies to another wallet or platform:
1.  Select "Withdraw" from the overview. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
2.  Choose the specific cryptocurrency you wish to withdraw, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or BNB. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
3.  Enter the wallet address of the recipient. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a> If you've used an address before, it might be found in your transaction book. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
4.  **Crucially, select the correct blockchain network** (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20, BEP-2). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
    *   It is vital that the network you select matches the network of the receiving wallet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a> If there is a mismatch, your cryptocurrency will be lost and will not reach its destination. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   The chosen network will display the associated commissions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> Commissions can vary depending on the network used. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>

## Withdrawing Fiat Currency

To withdraw fiat currency (e.g., Euro, Dollar) to a bank account:
1.  Go to "Withdraw Fiat". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
2.  Select the currency you wish to withdraw. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> For example, withdrawing Euros may incur a commission of 0.8 Euros. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>
3.  Enter the desired amount and the bank account details where you want the funds to be sent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>
4.  Available withdrawal methods will vary depending on the chosen currency. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> Methods like bank transfers or card payments may be offered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>

### Important Note on Bank Compatibility

Some conventional banks, such as Santander, Sabadell, or BBVA in Spain, may block transactions from cryptocurrency platforms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> If a transaction is blocked, the money may not reach your bank account and could remain in limbo. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>

It is recommended to use accounts from banks like N26 or Revolut for fiat withdrawals and [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | deposits]] on cryptocurrency platforms, as they are less likely to block these transactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

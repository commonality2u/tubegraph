This article outlines the process of [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing funds]] from your Coinbase Wallet to a bank account, primarily by first transferring the cryptocurrency to an exchange like Kraken. This tutorial can be followed using a mobile device (Android or iOS) or a computer, as the process is identical across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Why Use Kraken for Withdrawal?

It is recommended to use Kraken for withdrawing funds to your bank account over [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Coinbase]] because [[avoiding_high_transaction_fees_when_withdrawing_from_coinbase | Coinbase charges higher fees]] for this specific transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

If you don't have a Kraken account, a referral link offering a 20% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits is available in the first comment of the original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Withdrawal Process

The process involves transferring your cryptocurrency from Coinbase Wallet to Kraken, and then initiating the withdrawal from Kraken to your bank account.

### 1. Preparing for Transfer (On Kraken)

1.  **Navigate to Kraken**: Open the Kraken application or website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Access Portfolio**: Go to the "portfolio" section within Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  **Select Cryptocurrency**: Choose the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., Ethereum) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Deposit**: Click on the "deposit" option. If using a mobile device, you might need to click the three dots at the top first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
5.  **Copy Deposit Address**: The deposit will occur via the Ethereum blockchain (or relevant blockchain for your cryptocurrency), where your funds are hosted in your Coinbase Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Copy the generated deposit address provided by Kraken. This address is crucial for sending your funds from Coinbase Wallet.

### 2. Transferring from Coinbase Wallet to Kraken

1.  **Open Coinbase Wallet**: Access your Coinbase Wallet where your funds are held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  **Select Cryptocurrency**: Choose the cryptocurrency you intend to transfer (e.g., Ethereum).
3.  **Initiate Send**: Select the option to "send" your cryptocurrency.
4.  **Enter Amount**: Specify the amount you wish to send. You can opt to send the entire balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
5.  **Paste Kraken Address**: Paste the deposit address you copied from Kraken into the recipient address field in your Coinbase Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
6.  **Review and Confirm**: Before confirming, review the transaction details, including the network suggested and the transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. For an example transaction of Ethereum, commissions were shown between $5.79 to $6.52 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
7.  **Execute Transaction**: Confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The transaction will then be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

After confirmation, the asset will no longer appear in your Coinbase Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. The transfer typically takes around 14 minutes to complete and appear in your Kraken account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### 3. Withdrawing from Kraken to Bank Account

Once the funds are successfully deposited into your Kraken account, you can proceed with [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_kucoin_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing money from Kraken to your bank account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

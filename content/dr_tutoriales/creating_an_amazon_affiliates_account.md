To begin, navigate to the Amazon homepage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Once on the main Amazon site, locate and access the "Affiliate Program" link, typically found at the bottom left of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Starting the Application
Upon reaching the affiliate program page, select the "Join for free" option, usually located in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

#### 1. Account Information
The first step involves entering basic account details, such as your address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. If you already have an Amazon account, much of this information might be pre-filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. You must also specify the main owner of the account (e.g., the beneficiary indicated in the address) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

#### 2. Website/App List
A crucial part of the application is providing a website or app where you intend to promote products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

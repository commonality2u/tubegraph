To quickly [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | view responses]] from a Google Form, you can set up email notifications [00:00:00]. This feature allows you to be informed every time someone submits a response to your form [00:00:40].

## How to Enable Email Notifications

1.  Access the "Responses" tab within your Google Form [00:00:38].
2.  Click on the three dots icon (More options) [00:00:40].
3.  From the dropdown menu, select the option to receive email notifications for new responses [00:00:40].

## Other Response Options

Beyond email notifications, Google Forms offers several ways to manage and [[visualizing_and_analyzing_google_form_responses | analyze responses]]:

*   **Download Responses**: You can [[exporting_google_form_responses_to_csv_or_excel | download responses]] in CSV format [00:00:45].
*   **Open in Google Sheets**: Responses can be directly opened and managed in [[using_google_sheets_with_google_forms | Google Sheets]] [00:00:47]. This displays responses grouped by timestamp, showing the date, hour, and minute of submission, along with all submitted answers [00:01:39].
*   **Unlink Form**: You have the option to unlink the form from its response destination if needed [00:00:45].

For further analysis, you can [[visualizing_and_analyzing_google_form_responses | visualize responses]] in different ways within the form interface, including a summary view, by individual question, or by individual respondent [00:01:07]. The summary view is often preferred for seeing all responses collectively [00:01:22].

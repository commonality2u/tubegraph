## Navigating the MediaFire Interface

Upon creating an account, you will see your MediaFire platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The left panel displays your folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   The main panel shows options such as "Upload" (or "Applaud" in Spanish), "Filter," and other file management options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   You have the option to create new folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, a folder named "youtube tutorial" can be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Uploading Files

To [[uploading_and_managing_files_on_mediafire | upload files]] to a folder:

2.  Click the "Upload" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
3.  Select the file you wish to upload from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, a PNG thumbnail file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
4.  Click "Begin Upload" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
5.  The file will be queued and then uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Once complete, you can close the upload window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The uploaded file will appear in the folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Uploading Folders and Websites
*   The upload option also allows you to [[uploading_and_managing_files_on_mediafire | upload entire folders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This is useful for uploading multiple files within a single folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The option to upload websites is exclusive to premium users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. As a basic account user, this feature is not available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

## Sharing Files

Once a file is uploaded, you can [[sharing_mediafire_file_links | share the file]] by obtaining its link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
1.  Locate the file you want to share (e.g., the PNG file) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
2.  Click the three dots next to the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
3.  Select "Copy Link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
4.  The link is now copied to your clipboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
5.  Paste the link into a new tab or send it to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Anyone with the link can download the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Advanced Sharing Options
*   Clicking the "Share" option (instead of "Copy Link") provides a different menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   From this menu, you can modify who the link is shared with (e.g., for single sharing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   You can also see download options and direct download links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

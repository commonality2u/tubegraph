The KuCoin platform offers various order types to facilitate strategic buying and selling of cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Understanding these orders can make managing purchases and sales much easier within the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

To access these orders, navigate to the "Trade" section and then to "Spot Wallet Market" on the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The orders discussed are applicable to other market types as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. For a broader understanding of the platform, refer to the [[kucoin_platform_overview_and_interface|KuCoin platform overview and interface]] tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Additionally, KuCoin offers [[kucoin_investment_products|investment products]] like staking, flexible terms, and KCS bonus, which can help make cryptocurrencies profitable and generate compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The main order types available are:

## Market Order

A market order is executed in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. It allows you to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at its current market value the instant you click to execute the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For example, if KCS is trading at 10.689, a market order to buy KCS would be executed at that value immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The price at which the order is executed is the exact price of the crypto asset at that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

## Limit Order

A limit order allows you to set a specific price and quantity for a buy or sell order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The order will only be executed when the real market price reaches or surpasses the determined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

To use a limit order:
1.  **Set a Price:** You can use the interactive graph to identify support and resistance levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For instance, if you believe KCS will drop to 9.984 before rising again, you can set a limit buy order at that price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
2.  **Set a Quantity:** Define how much cryptocurrency you wish to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
3.  **Execution:** The order is placed on the market and will only execute once the asset's price reaches your specified limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If the price does not reach the set value, the order will remain open until manually cancelled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Open orders can be viewed and cancelled in the "Open Orders" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Stop Limit Order

The stop limit order introduces two key prices: a **limit price** and a **stop price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Limit Price:** This is the price at which the order is initially placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Stop Price:** This is a trigger price. When the market price reaches the stop price, the limit order becomes active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

**How it works:**
The order begins to execute gradually when the market price reaches the **limit price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. It will continue to execute piece by piece as the price moves towards the **stop price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. One hundred percent of the order is executed only when the price reaches the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. If the price does not reach the stop price, only a percentage of the order will have been executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

This order type is crucial for reducing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, as it ensures that if the price doesn't follow the desired pattern, you won't lose all the money committed to the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Stop Market Order

The stop market order is similar to the stop limit order but executes at the market price instead of a set limit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Stop Price:** This is the trigger price.
*   **Market Execution:** Once the market price reaches the stop price, a market order is placed immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

**How it works:**
You set a stop price (e.g., 11.041 for a buy order) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. When the market price reaches this stop price, the system will start buying or selling at the current market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Similar to the stop limit, the order executes progressively, with 100% execution when the price reaches the defined stop point from the initial market point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

You can view active stop market orders in the "Stop Orders" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a> and cancel them at any point, even if partially executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

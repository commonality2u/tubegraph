Inserting videos into PowerPoint presentations can be very useful for enhancing your content and engaging your audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. For example, you might want to include a video in a final degree project presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Adding an Online Video

To add an [[adding_online_videos_to_powerpoint_presentations | online video]] from YouTube to your PowerPoint presentation, follow these steps:

1.  Ensure you have a PowerPoint presentation open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Add a new slide where you want the video to appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the **Insert** tab in the PowerPoint ribbon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
4.  In the "Media" section, click on **Video** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
5.  Select **Online Video** from the dropdown options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This option is distinct from [[inserting_videos_from_a_computer_into_powerpoint | inserting a video directly from your computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
6.  Locate the YouTube video you wish to insert and copy its link (URL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
7.  Paste the URL into the provided field and click **Insert** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The video will then be ready to view directly within your presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Requirements for Online Videos

[!WARNING]
To view an online video (like one from YouTube) during a PowerPoint presentation, an active internet connection is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If there is no Wi-Fi or internet connection, the YouTube video will not be visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This differs from [[inserting_videos_from_a_computer_into_powerpoint | videos inserted from your computer]], which can be viewed at any time without an internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

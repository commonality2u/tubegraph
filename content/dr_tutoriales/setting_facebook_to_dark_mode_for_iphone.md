This tutorial explains how to [[activating_dark_mode_on_facebook | activate dark mode on Facebook]] on your mobile phone, including iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The instructions are also applicable for [[setting_facebook_to_dark_mode_for_android | Android devices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Before You Start

Ensure you have the Facebook application downloaded and [[updating_facebook_app_for_new_features | updated]] to the latest version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, as this is crucial for accessing new features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   **Check for Updates:** Go to the App Store, search for "Facebook," and either download it if you don't have it, or select "Update" if an update is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. If it's already fully updated, select "Open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Activating Dark Mode

1.  **Open Facebook:** Once the app is updated or opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Menu:** Tap the three horizontal lines located on the bottom right of the screen to open the menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **Find Settings & Privacy:** In the menu, locate and select "Settings & Privacy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
4.  **Select Dark Mode:** Within the "Settings & Privacy" section, find the option labeled "Dark Mode," which is typically represented by a moon icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Tap on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Dark Mode Options

Upon selecting Dark Mode, you will find three choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>:

*   **System (Default):** This option, selected by default, means Facebook will automatically adjust its appearance based on your iPhone's [[system_settings_integration_with_facebook_dark_mode | system settings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. If your iPhone is set to dark mode, Facebook will appear in dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If your iPhone is in light mode, Facebook will also switch to light mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Deactivate:** This forces Facebook to display in light mode (white), even if your iPhone's system is set to dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Activate:** This forces Facebook to display in dark mode, even if your iPhone's system is set to light mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This allows you to view Facebook in dark mode independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

The recommended setting is "System" to maintain a consistent visual experience across your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Dark Mode Shade
> Facebook's dark mode does not use a pure black background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Instead, it features a darker shade of gray that is lighter than absolute black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

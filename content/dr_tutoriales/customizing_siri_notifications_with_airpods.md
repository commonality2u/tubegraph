This guide explains how to customize how Siri announces notifications through your AirPods on an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This includes options to deactivate announcements entirely or select specific applications for Siri to announce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Accessing Notification Settings

1.  Open the **Settings** app on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Ensure your AirPods are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the **Notifications** section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If you cannot find it, use the search bar at the top of the Settings screen and type "notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  Tap on **Notifications** to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Managing Siri Announce Notifications

Within the Notifications settings, you will find options related to how notifications are displayed (e.g., group, list, or count) for general applications like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To customize Siri announcements for AirPods:

1.  Look for **Siri, Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Tap on **Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  Here, you can choose to activate or deactivate Siri announcing notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   To deactivate Siri from reading notifications aloud when wearing headphones, toggle the option off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   If you want Siri to announce notifications, ensure this option is activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. When active, you may also have the option to respond without confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Selecting Specific Apps for Siri Announcements

You can further refine which apps have their notifications announced by Siri through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

*   Scroll down within the **Announce Notifications** section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   You will see a list of your installed applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   For each app, you can individually choose whether Siri announces its notifications through your headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, if you have Siri announcing notifications through headphones generally, but wish for a specific app like "Fever" to stop announcing, you can toggle its individual setting off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

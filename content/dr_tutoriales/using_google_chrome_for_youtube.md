[[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] is a trusted search engine and browser that works perfectly for accessing YouTube [00:00:36]. This tutorial demonstrates how to use [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] to put YouTube videos on a loop on a PC [00:00:05].

## Looping YouTube Videos

Looping a video on YouTube allows it to restart automatically after it finishes, without needing to hit replay or start it again [00:00:09]. This feature is useful for listening to music or watching videos continuously [00:01:17].

### How to Activate Loop Mode

1.  Access any YouTube video within [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] [00:00:44].
2.  Right-click on the video frame [00:01:07].
3.  A dropdown menu will appear [00:01:12].
4.  Click on "Loop" from the menu [00:01:13].
5.  Once activated, the video will start again automatically when it ends [00:01:16].

### How to Deactivate Loop Mode

1.  While the video is playing, right-click on the screen again [00:01:45].
2.  The dropdown menu will reappear [00:01:47].
3.  Click on "Loop" again in the same way to deactivate it [00:01:48].
4.  Once deactivated, the video will end and pause playback when it finishes, rather than restarting [00:01:57].

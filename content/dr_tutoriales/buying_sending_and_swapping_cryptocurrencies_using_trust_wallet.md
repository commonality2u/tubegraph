[[how_to_use_trust_wallet_step_by_step_in_2025 | Trust Wallet]] is a mobile application available for both [[trust_wallet_functionalities_for_android_and_ios | Android and iOS]] devices, offering identical functionalities across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin using Trust Wallet, the application must first be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Upon opening, users have two primary options: [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | import an existing wallet]] or [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | create a new one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Creating a New Wallet
If creating a new wallet, the process involves:
1.  Accepting the privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.
2.  Setting an access code (password) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.
3.  Making a copy of the 12-word secret phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:29">[01:01:29]</a>. This phrase is critical; its loss means loss of funds, and sharing it makes funds vulnerable to theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:36">[01:01:36]</a>. It is highly recommended to store this phrase on physical paper rather than a PC due to hacking risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>.
4.  Verifying the secret phrase by re-entering the words in the correct order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:11">[01:02:11]</a>.

### Importing an Existing Wallet
If importing, users simply need to provide their 12-word recovery phrase in the correct order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

## Core Functionalities

Once the wallet is set up, the main interface displays options for notifications and viewing accepted cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:27">[01:02:27]</a>. Users can filter which coins are visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. The primary actions available are sending, receiving, buying, and swapping cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Receiving Cryptocurrencies
To receive cryptocurrencies, users select the "Receive" option for the desired coin (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. This will display a QR code and a textual address for the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. It's crucial to ensure that the correct blockchain is used for the transaction, as different cryptocurrencies may require specific blockchains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Many different cryptocurrencies can be received in Trust Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

### Sending Cryptocurrencies
The "Send" option allows users to transfer cryptocurrencies from their Trust Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. However, funds must be present in the wallet to initiate a send transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This function is integral for [[sending_and_receiving_cryptocurrencies_with_coinbase_wallet | sending and receiving cryptocurrencies]] and [[transferring_cryptocurrency_between_platforms | transferring cryptocurrency between platforms]].

### Swapping Cryptocurrencies
The "Swap" function enables users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another directly within the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Trust Wallet aims to use the best market rate for swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. An example rate of 1 BNB for 951.638 ERGO is given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Buying Cryptocurrencies
Users can buy cryptocurrencies directly through Trust Wallet using third-party providers like Simplex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>. For example, to buy BNB, the current cost might be around US$150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Choosing a provider like Simplex redirects the user to their page to complete the purchase via card payment or other necessary methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. This function can be compared to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | buying and selling cryptocurrencies on Binance]].

## Other Features

Other staking options like Solana are also visible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

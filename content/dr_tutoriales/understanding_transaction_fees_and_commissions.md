## Transaction Fees in Practice
When transferring Bitcoin from a Coinbase account to a Binance account, a commission fee is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. For example, a transfer of 110.39 units of currency might result in 109.70 units being received, indicating a commission of slightly less than one euro was charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

This commission is deducted directly from the amount being sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The transaction is confirmed on both the sending platform (Coinbase) and the receiving platform (Binance) through a verification code sent to a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> and through confirmation messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Transactions typically take around 10 minutes to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The successful transfer and applied commission can be viewed in the transaction history and wallet balances on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Users also receive email confirmations for transfers, which can serve as collateral in case of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

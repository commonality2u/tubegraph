This tutorial outlines the process of withdrawing capital from a platform like Trust Wallet to a bank account via an exchange like Binance, using a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. The steps are demonstrated on an iPhone, but the process is identical for Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.

## General Withdrawal Principle

The core principle involves sending cryptocurrency from one wallet or platform to a conventional exchange that supports fiat withdrawals to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Exchanges like Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and Kraken are examples of platforms that allow withdrawals to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Withdrawal Process

### 1. Initiate Transfer from Trust Wallet

*   **Open Trust Wallet**: Launch the Trust Wallet application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
*   **Select Cryptocurrency**: Identify the specific cryptocurrency you wish to withdraw. In this example, BNB (Binance Coin) is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Send Cryptocurrency**: Tap "Send" within the Trust Wallet interface to initiate the transfer of your BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Specify the amount you want to send (e.g., $56 worth of BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### 2. Obtain Deposit Information from Binance

*   **Open Binance**: Open the Binance application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
*   **Select Deposit**: Choose the "Deposit" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Choose Cryptocurrency**: Search for and select the cryptocurrency you are depositing (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   **Select Blockchain Network**: It's crucial to choose the correct blockchain network. For BNB, the "Beacon Chain" (BEP2) is specified in this example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Copy Wallet Address and Memo**: Copy the unique deposit wallet address provided by Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. If a memo (or destination tag) is also provided, copy that as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### 3. Complete Transfer in Trust Wallet

*   **Paste Address and Memo**: Return to Trust Wallet and paste the copied Binance wallet address into the appropriate field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. If a memo was copied, paste that into its designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Confirm Transaction**: Review the transaction details, including any associated commissions (e.g., two cents per dollar for this transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   Your capital has now been transferred from Trust Wallet to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The funds will appear in your Binance Spot Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

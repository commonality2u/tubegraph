This article details a common method for [[blocking_and_unlocking_keyboards_on_windows | blocking and unlocking keyboards on Windows]] computers, specifically addressing issues that can arise from accidental keyboard lock. The tutorial is applicable to Windows 7, 8, and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Accidental Keyboard Locking

A common cause for a keyboard to stop responding is the accidental activation of the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Windows Filter Keys]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This can occur if the Shift key is held down for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

When activated, a prompt asking "Do you want to turn on the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter keys]] of Windows Ten?" may appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The "Yes" option often appears by default, and users may unintentionally select it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Once enabled, the keyboard becomes unresponsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Unlocking the Keyboard

To [[how_to_unlock_keyboard_on_windows_10 | unlock a keyboard]] that has been disabled by the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] feature:

2.  A sound will indicate the feature has been reactivated, and the keyboard should regain full functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

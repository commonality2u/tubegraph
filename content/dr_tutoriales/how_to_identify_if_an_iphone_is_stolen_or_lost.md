This tutorial explains how to check if an iPhone is stolen, lost, or reported missing using its IMEI number and an online tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process is straightforward and involves two main components: the mobile device itself and a specific web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Understanding the IMEI Number

Every Apple device possesses a unique identification number called an IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This number is crucial because when a mobile phone is lost or stolen, Apple can register that IMEI as a lost, disappeared, or stolen device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

It is highly recommended to [[importance_of_checking_an_iphone_before_purchase | check the IMEI number]] when purchasing a second-hand device to confirm it has not been reported as stolen or missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## [[steps_to_check_email_number_of_an_iPhone | Steps to Find the IMEI Number]]

The IMEI number can be found in several locations on an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### For an Active iPhone

1.  Navigate to **Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Go to **General** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
3.  Select **Information** (or "About") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  Scroll down to find the IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### [[understanding_dual_sim_email_numbers_in_iphones | Dual SIM iPhones]]

If your device has dual SIM capability, you will see two IMEI numbers, one associated with each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. It is essential to check both IMEI numbers to ensure neither is reported as stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### For a Locked or Reset iPhone

If the device is locked or has been recently reset, the IMEI can still be found. A screenshot illustration can show how to find it in such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Other Locations

The IMEI may also be found on the device's housing or SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## [[using_online_tools_to_verify_an_iphones_status | Using an Online Tool to Verify iPhone Status]]

Once you have the IMEI number(s), you can use a specific web page to check the device's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. The link to this page is typically provided in the first comment of the video tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### Verification Steps:

1.  Access the specified web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
2.  Copy and paste the IMEI number into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
3.  Complete the "I am not a robot" verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  Click "Check" to see the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The tool will indicate if the IMEI is reported, stolen, or associated with any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, it might show if "Find My iPhone" is active, if the device is unlocked, or if it is on a "BlackBook" (a list of stolen devices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

> For instance, a check might reveal: "activated," "Finding the iPhone," "crazy," and "not in the ie which is not stolen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Or, "Find the iPhone," "it's unlocked," and "not is on the BlackBook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

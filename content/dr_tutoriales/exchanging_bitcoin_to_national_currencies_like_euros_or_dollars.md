## Key Considerations

When you withdraw benefits to a bank account, it is necessary to declare those benefits and pay taxes in your country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

The platform recommended for these operations is Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. If you need to create an account, a referral link offering a 10% discount on commissions is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Converting Bitcoin to National Currency

Assuming you have Bitcoin in your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, the process involves navigating to the relevant market on the platform.

### Recommended Conversion Strategy
It is generally recommended to [[converting_bitcoin_to_other_cryptocurrencies | convert Bitcoin to another cryptocurrency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> rather than directly to a national currency, as national currencies tend to devalue over time compared to cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. However, to [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency | withdraw capital from the platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, conversion to national currency is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Steps to Convert Bitcoin to Euros (Example)
1.  **Search for the Market**: On the main page, search for the BTC-Euro market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
2.  **View Chart**: A tab will open showing the Bitcoin-Euro chart, which can be viewed in various timeframes (e.g., 4-hour, 1-day) to observe Bitcoin's variation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  **Sell Bitcoin**: Locate the "Sell Bitcoin" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This action [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | transforms Bitcoin into euros]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
4.  **Enter Amount**: Choose the amount you wish to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. You can enter a specific number, or select the total/maximum available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Minimum Order**: Be aware of minimum order requirements (e.g., 10 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   **Order Types**: You can choose between a limit order (specifying a price) or a market order (selling at the current market price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. A market order executes immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Sale**: Once the amount is defined, confirm the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. The equivalent amount in euros will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Converting Other Cryptocurrencies to National Currency

Some cryptocurrencies cannot be directly converted to euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> (e.g., Volkswat, as mentioned in the transcript, only allowing conversion to Bitcoin, dollar, or other cryptos but not euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>).

In such cases, a two-step process is required:
1.  **First Conversion**: Convert the cryptocurrency to Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
2.  **Second Conversion**: Then, from Bitcoin, [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | transfer it to your national currency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This ensures you can convert any cryptocurrency to your desired national currency using Bitcoin as an intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

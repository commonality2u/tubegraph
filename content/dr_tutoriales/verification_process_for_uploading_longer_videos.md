YouTube channels typically face a restriction that prevents them from [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | uploading videos longer than fifteen minutes]] unless a specific permission is enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. If an unenabled channel attempts to upload a video exceeding this duration, the upload process will block the video and get stuck at ninety-nine percent processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is not a mistake but a required permission for new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Enabling Longer Video Uploads

To resolve this and allow [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | longer video uploads]], the channel owner must enable this permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Accessing YouTube Studio Settings

The first step is to go to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] for the channel you wish to enable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Once in [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], it is recommended to switch to the classic version for quicker navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

From the classic version, click on the "channel" window located in the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section displays various options and current channel permissions, such as upload status, monetization, and live broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Locating the Longer Video Upload Option

Within the channel settings, find the window labeled "longer lasting victims" (likely referring to longer duration videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This specific setting is what allows [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | uploading videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For channels that have not enabled this feature, it will typically show as "No" or "not allowed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

### The Verification Process

To activate this feature, you will need to access this window and initiate a [[youtube_account_verification | verification]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This [[youtube_account_verification | verification]] confirms that the YouTube account belongs to you, regardless of whether you are accessing it via a computer, Android, or iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

During the verification, YouTube will send a confirmation code to your registered mobile phone, Gmail, or email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. By entering this confirmation code, you verify ownership of the [[youtube_account_verification | YouTube account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Once this verification is complete and the "longer lasting victims" option is enabled, you will be able to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos]] with a duration greater than fifteen minutes without any further issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

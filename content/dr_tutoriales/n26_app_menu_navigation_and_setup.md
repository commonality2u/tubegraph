The N26 mobile banking application is designed for efficient and useful banking operations directly from a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This tutorial covers its basic operations and features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The N26 app is notable for its commission-free domestic and international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. It is compatible with both iPhone and Android devices, as the application's interface is identical across operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## App Layout and Main Menus

Upon entering the N26 application, users will find two primary menus:
*   **Lower Menu:** Consists of `Start`, `Spaces`, `Exploring`, and `Cards` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Upper Menu:** Provides four options: `Profile`, `Questions` (help), `Statistics`/`Upcoming Payments`/`Statements`, and `Search` for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The standard N26 account is free and does not incur monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Upper Menu Functionality

### Profile
The profile section displays personal account information, including the IBAN and a QR code for receiving instant transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Visibility Activation:** Users can activate their visibility to allow other N26 users to send them money instantly via QR code, phone number, or email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This feature is similar to common mobile transfer concepts in some regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
*   **Invite Friends:** An option to invite friends is available, offering a 5 Euro bonus to new users who open an account using a referral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Configuration:** This area allows for managing personal information, application settings (e.g., language, proximity sensor mode, promotional codes, marketing communications), and security settings (e.g., PIN/password changes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Users can also log out or open a new session for a different account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Change of Bank:** N26 provides an option to facilitate a change of bank, handling the transfer of addresses and payments to the N26 account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Questions/Help
This section provides access to customer support, including a chat feature that can connect users with a robot or a physical person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. It also contains information on payments, transfers, account types, and subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Chat access requires user verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Statistics, Upcoming Payments, Statements
These features are mentioned as accessible but are covered in more detail later in the app's lower menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Search Transactions
A magnifying glass icon allows users to search through all their transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Lower Menu Functionality

### Home (Start)
The `Start` screen displays the current balance, which can be made visible or invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Key options include:
*   **Receive Money:** Users can request money via bank transfer, debit/credit card, or QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

*   **Adding Funds:** To issue a physical card, a minimum balance of ten euros is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The first instant transfer to fund the N26 account via credit or debit card is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. The app guides the user through adding funds, including card details and authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

### Cards
This section manages both virtual and physical cards.
*   **Ordering Physical Card:** Once funds are added, users can order a physical card for ATM withdrawals and in-store payments where mobile payments are not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   **Card Options:** Users can choose their card type based on their account (e.g., transparent for free accounts, metal or black for premium accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
    *   **Shipping:** Normal delivery costs ten euros and takes approximately two weeks, while express delivery takes three working days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
    *   Order confirmation is provided, and updates are visible on the app's start screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Notifications confirm the card order and provide estimated arrival dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Virtual Card and Mobile Wallet Integration:** An active virtual card is immediately available and can be added to mobile wallets like Apple Wallet (Apple Pay) or Google Wallet (Android) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This allows users to pay with their mobile phone even before receiving the physical card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The process involves confirming card details and accepting terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Card Management Options:** Users can view card information, lock the card, and adjust card settings (e.g., enable/disable payments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. This provides control over card activation, deactivation, and blocking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals:** The basic account offers free withdrawals in extra currency, though with quantity limits; premium accounts offer unlimited withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### Spaces
The `Spaces` feature allows users to create subaccounts to organize their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Trial Period:** A trial of 59-60 days is offered for free users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
*   **Premium Feature:** This feature is primarily for premium users, allowing them to create up to two (or more, e.g. 10 for N26 Metal) subaccounts, set savings goals, and easily move money between spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.
*   **Management:** Users can edit their main account space, receive/send money, or modify it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. They can view transaction history and customize the space (e.g., rename, change image, view excerpts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Funds sent will go to the designated space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. This feature helps in diversifying finances, such as creating separate spaces for saving or spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

### Explore
The `Explore` section displays different offers and the contracted service plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Account Information:** Users can view details about their N26 Standard account, including statistics, free withdrawals, commission-free worldwide payments, and help chat access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   **Account Types:** Information on other N26 account types, such as N26 Metal (more expensive, around seventeen euros a month) and N26 You (around ninety euros a month), is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. These premium accounts offer additional benefits like more free withdrawals and more `Spaces` subaccounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
*   **Exclusive Offers:** This section features exclusive offers that are regularly updated, such as discounts (e.g., thirty percent off Reebok) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Premium plan holders typically have access to more offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

Optimizing finances within the N26 application is recommended due to minimal expenses and access to numerous services, especially with a premium account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

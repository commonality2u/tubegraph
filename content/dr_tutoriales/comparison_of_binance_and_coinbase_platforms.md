This article compares the features and costs associated with the Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance platforms, aiming to determine which platform offers the best value for buying cryptocurrencies or investing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The comparison will evaluate account fees, deposit fees, trading commissions, investment products (staking), and withdrawal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Overview of Platforms

The comparison uses a spreadsheet to detail the different aspects of each platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The previous video tutorial already covered the [[using_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_for_transactions | comparison between Coinbase and Coinbase Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, with Coinbase Pro generally being superior for commissions and associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Account Fees

All three platforms — Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance — offer free accounts, meaning no charges for simply having an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This category results in a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Deposit Fees

Deposit fees vary significantly across the platforms:

*   **Coinbase**: Charges a commission ranging from 1% to 4%, depending on the specific deposit method and region (e.g., 3.99% for Chile) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: A SEPA transfer costs 0.15 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Binance**: Offers varied options for fiat deposits:
    *   Visa/Mastercard: 1.8% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   SEPA transfer: 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   iDeal: 1.3 Euros commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   SWIFT transfer (USD): 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Quick Payments (GBP): 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

It is recommended to use bank transfers for fiat deposits to avoid high card commissions, which can be up to 1.8% on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Paying commissions means losing money that could otherwise be reinvested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

**Winner for Deposits**: Binance generally wins this category as it offers several 0% commission options for bank transfers (SEPA, SWIFT, Quick Payments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Users can also save up to 10% on commissions on Binance by using a referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Trading Fees

When it comes to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | buying and selling cryptocurrencies]], the trading commissions are a key factor:

*   **Binance**: Standard commission is 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This can be reduced significantly (down to 0.02%) based on the amount of Bitcoin or BNB held, with up to nine levels of reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Additionally, by selecting the option to pay commissions with BNB, users can reduce fees by up to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. For example, a 0.1% fee can become approximately 0.075% when paid with BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Coinbase**: Fixed commissions can range from 0.99 Euros to 3 Euros, depending on the amount of Bitcoin or money held on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: Commissions range from 0.04% to 0.50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

For most users who are not large investors (e.g., with over 50,000 or 100,000 Euros), the maximum commissions are usually applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

**Winner for Trading**: Binance clearly wins for trading commissions, offering rates up to five times lower than Coinbase Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

## Staking and Investment Products

For [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | investing cryptocurrencies]] and earning returns:

*   **Binance**: Offers a wide variety of products, including flexible, locked, and high-risk options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. These products allow users to achieve very high returns; for example, staking Cake can yield 37.49% for 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This is a significant advantage for those looking to maximize their crypto earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Coinbase and Coinbase Pro**: Their offerings for investment products are significantly more limited and less competitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

**Winner for Staking/Investment Products**: Binance is the undisputed winner in this category due to its diverse and high-yield investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Withdrawal Fees

Withdrawal fees for fiat currency:

*   **Binance**:
    *   Euros (SEPA transfer): 0.8 Euros commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   Bank card: 1% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
    *   Pound Sterling (Quick Payments): 1.5 Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   Dollars (SWIFT): 30 Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
    *   The platform also offers a Binance Card, which allows users to pay with cryptocurrencies directly without withdrawing to a bank, offering benefits like cashback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.
*   **Coinbase**: Charges up to 4% or a maximum of 10 Euros per withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: Generally offers lower withdrawal fees than Binance for certain methods. For example, wire transfers for Pound Sterling and SEPA transfers are cheaper on Coinbase Pro, and SWIFT transfers are 25 dollars less than Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

**Winner for Withdrawals**: Coinbase Pro takes the lead for standard fiat withdrawals in some currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. However, the use of the Binance Card is highly recommended to avoid withdrawal fees altogether and gain cashback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## Conclusion

Based on this [[comparison_of_different_platforms_for_deposits | comparison of different platforms for deposits]], trading commissions, investment products, and withdrawal options, **Binance is recommended as the superior platform** for operating with cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>.

Binance stands out for:

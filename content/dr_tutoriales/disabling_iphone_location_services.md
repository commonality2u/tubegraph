*   In the **Location Services** menu, you can toggle the main switch to **Off** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This action will deactivate location services system-wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

You can also cancel location sharing globally:

*   Within the **Location Services** section, there is an option to **Share My Location** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. You can tap this to manage or disable it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Disabling Location for Specific Applications

You can control location access for individual apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>:

1.  From the **Location Services** screen, scroll down to see a list of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  Tap on an app to adjust its location permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. You will typically find the following options:
    *   **Ask Next Time Or When I Share**: The app will ask for permission each time it attempts to use your location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   **Never**: The app will never be allowed to access your location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **While Using the App**: The app can use your location only when it is active and in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   **Always**: The app can access your location at any time, even when not in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
3.  You can select the option that best suits your needs for each app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Location permissions can be managed differently depending on the application and its intended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Some applications, like ride-sharing services (e.g., Uber, Bolt), may require location services to function correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

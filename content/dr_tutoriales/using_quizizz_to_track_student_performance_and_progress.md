Quizizz is an online tool that allows teachers to create didactic tests for students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. After registering as a teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>, users can access various features to manage and track student performance.

## Accessing Student Reports

The "Reports" section within Quizizz provides an overview of student performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:41">[02:17:41]</a>. This feature displays reports for students who have completed quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:35">[02:19:35]</a>.

## Tracking Notes and Qualifications

The reports help teachers keep track of the notes and qualifications students have obtained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:41">[02:23:41]</a>. This information is useful for:
*   Identifying areas where students may need reinforcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:80">[02:28:80]</a>.
*   Determining where to encourage students to improve their grades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:80">[02:31:80]</a>.

## Managing Student Groups and Notifications

Quizizz integrates with Google Classroom for organizing student groups, though students can also connect via a direct link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:90">[02:40:90]</a>. This allows for:
*   Students to receive notifications from different questionnaires in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:70">[02:59:70]</a>.
*   Teachers to assign quizzes to specific classes, which will arrive at a set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:40">[07:31:40]</a>.

The platform includes features like default "memes" that appear during tests to help students relax, which can contribute to better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:40">[04:06:40]</a>. Ultimately, the results reflecting student performance are visible to the teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:90">[04:20:90]</a>.

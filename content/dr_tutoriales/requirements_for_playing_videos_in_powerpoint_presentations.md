PowerPoint presentations can incorporate videos, either directly from a computer or from online sources like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The method of insertion and the playback requirements differ for each type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Inserting Videos

To insert a video into a PowerPoint presentation, navigate to the "Insert" tab and select "Video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. From there, two options are available:

3.  Click "Insert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Playback Requirements

The primary requirement for playing videos in PowerPoint depends on whether the video is sourced online or locally.

### Online Videos (e.g., YouTube)

For online videos, an active internet connection is necessary for the video to play during the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If there is no internet connection, the video will not be visible or playable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Local Videos (from Computer)

Videos inserted directly from your computer do not require an internet connection to play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These videos can be viewed at any time, even without Wi-Fi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

| :--------- | :-------------- | :------------------- |
| Online     | YouTube, etc.   | Internet connection  |

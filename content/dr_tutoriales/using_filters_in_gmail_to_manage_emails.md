This guide details how to automatically organize your Gmail emails into specific folders using filters, allowing for better prioritization and management of your inbox.

## Getting Started: Setting Up Automatic Email Organization
To begin organizing emails automatically, you first need to ensure you have [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | email folders]] set up in your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. If you're unsure how to [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | create folders]], a separate tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The goal is to [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | organize emails automatically]] so they bypass your main inbox and go directly into designated folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Accessing Gmail and Identifying Folders
The process begins by accessing your Gmail account through your preferred browser, such as Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Once in your mail, the first step is to review the existing folders. For example, you might have folders for YouTube, social networks, Google, and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The aim is to classify emails from specific accounts, such as YouTube, to go directly into their respective folders, bypassing the "Received" or "Inbox" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This allows you to [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | prioritize and sort]] emails based on importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Creating a Filter for Automatic Email Sorting

The main objective is to group all emails from a specific sender (e.g., YouTube notifications) into a designated folder and [[filtering_emails_from_specific_accounts | create a filter]] so they automatically enter there without passing through the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. These emails will then appear as unread within their folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, which is crucial for giving priority to certain messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Steps to Create a Filter:
1.  **Select an email from the target account:** Choose an email from the sender you wish to filter. For instance, an automatic mailbox like "no-reply@youtube.com" that sends notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
2.  **Filter similar messages:** Click the three-dots menu on the selected email and choose "Filter similar messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This action helps identify all emails from that specific account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
3.  **Create the filter:** After identifying the sender, instruct Gmail to "create a filter for this account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
4.  **Configure filter settings:**
    *   **Skip the Inbox (Archive it):** Select "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" to ensure emails do not go to your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **Apply the label:** Choose the specific folder/label where you want these emails to be directed (e.g., "YouTube" folder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Also apply filter to matching conversations:** Check this option to apply the filter to all existing emails that meet the criteria (e.g., all past emails from "no-reply@youtube.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
5.  **Create filter:** Click "Create filter" to activate the rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Verification of Automatic Filtering
Once the filter is created, all emails from the specified sender (e.g., "no-reply@youtube.com") will be automatically moved into their designated folder and marked as unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

To demonstrate, sending a new comment notification from a secondary Google account will show that the email directly enters the YouTube folder, bypassing the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The folder count will increase, and the new email will be found automatically classified within that folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

This method of [[filtering_and_managing_emails_in_gmail | creating filters]] effectively [[organizing_emails_with_labels | organizes your email]] automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

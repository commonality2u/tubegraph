[[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] serves as a secure application for storing cryptocurrencies and tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. It functions as an independent wallet separate from the main [[Coinbase]] exchange platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>.

## Availability and Focus
[[Coinbase Wallet]] is accessible via Google Play and the Apple App Store for mobile devices (Android and iOS), and as a Google Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. The mobile application is largely similar across both Android and iOS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. The mobile version is emphasized as a constantly available device for managing crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. For information on setting up the wallet, refer to [[how_to_download_and_set_up_coinbase_wallet | How to download and set up Coinbase Wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Asset Storage and Security
[[Coinbase Wallet]] allows users to store various cryptocurrencies and some NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
Security features include:
*   Secure authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Two-factor authentication (Go better authentication) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   Cloud backup option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   Ability to protect the wallet with Face ID (on iPhone) or a password (on other devices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### Backup and Recovery
Users are prompted to back up their [[Coinbase Wallet]] upon setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>. It is critical to understand that losing the recovery phrase means irreversible loss of access to the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Backup options include iCloud backup or manual backup of a 12-word recovery phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

### Sending and Receiving

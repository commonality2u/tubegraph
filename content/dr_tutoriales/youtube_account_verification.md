When [[registering_and_logging_into_youtube_account | creating a new YouTube account]], the platform does not initially allow the upload of videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. To enable this and other advanced features, a verification process is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Purpose of Verification

[[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | Verifying a YouTube account]] enables several key functions that are not available by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. These include:
*   Uploading videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Using custom thumbnails for videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
*   Initiating live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

By contrast, default functions like uploading videos, creating playlists, and adding video collaborations are enabled without [[youtube_channel_verification_process | verification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Accessing Verification Settings

To begin the [[youtube_channel_verification_process | verification process]] for a new account:
1.  Access the [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_new_accounts | YouTube Studio]] from your YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  Select the "Channel" sub-tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
4.  Go to "Access to functions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
5.  Here, you will find the "Functions that require [[phone_number_verification_for_youtube | verification by phone]]" listed as "available," indicating the need for phone verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Verification Process

### Requirements

The primary [[requirements_for_youtube_channel_verification | requirement for YouTube channel verification]] is to enter a phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. A verification code will then be sent to this number via text message or call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Steps

1.  Within the "Access to functions" section, select the option to verify the phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
2.  Choose your country and your preferred method for receiving the verification code (e.g., text message) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
3.  Enter your phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
4.  Click "send" to receive the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
5.  Once you enter the received verification code, your account will be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

After successful [[phone_number_verification_for_youtube | phone verification]], the previously restricted functions, such as uploading videos longer than 15 minutes, will be enabled for your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

This article outlines how to access and manage various security features and account settings within the [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_device|Binance app]] on a mobile device, applicable for both iPhone and Android users, as the app provides the same utilities across platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Accessing Your Account and Profile

Upon opening the [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_device|Binance app]], users will log in using their email and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A security verification step is required to confirm the user is not a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, followed by a security code sent to the mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

Once logged in, the main screen displays a submenu at the bottom with options such as Home, Markets, Futures, and Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. At the top of the screen, users can find their profile icon, a bell for alerts, and a symbol to access the camera for scanning QR codes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

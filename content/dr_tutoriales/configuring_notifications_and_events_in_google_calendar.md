3.  Select "add an event" from the options that appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

When creating an event, you can input various details:

*   **Date** Confirm the event's date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Guests** Optionally, add guests to the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Configuring Notifications

This ensures users are notified of the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

This article outlines the process of [[inserting_signatures_and_other_elements_in_pdfs | inserting a signature]] into a PDF file, specifically focusing on using scanned images or digital representations of signatures.

## Overview
The tutorial demonstrates how to [[filling_and_signing_pdf_documents | fill and sign PDF documents]] using a readily available "fill out and sign" feature, which often appears on the right side of the screen after opening a PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This feature offers options such as "fill out, sign, and send" or "obtain the signature of others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Preparing Your Signature
To insert a signature, you will need a PDF file and a signature ready in an image format (e.g., scanned or photographed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If using your own signature, it can be scanned or a photo can be taken and transferred to your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Steps to Insert a Signature
1.  **Open the PDF:** Begin by opening the desired PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Access "Fill and Sign":** Click on the "fill out and sign" option usually located on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Navigate to Signing Area:** Scroll to the specific area within the document where you wish to place the signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Methods for Adding a Signature
The signing tool provides several ways to add a signature:
*   **Write Text:** You can directly type text, such as a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Draw Signature:** You have the option to draw your signature directly within the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Use an Image (Scanned Signature):** This method involves using a pre-existing signature in image format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Inserting a Scanned/Image Signature
To use a scanned or image signature:
1.  **Click "Sign":** Go to the "Sign" option, typically found at the top right of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
2.  **Add Signature:** Select "Add a signature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
3.  **Choose Image:** Select the signature image file from your desktop or preferred location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Adjusting and Saving the Signature
Once the signature image is inserted, you can:
*   **Move:** Drag the signature to the desired position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
*   **Resize:** Make the signature larger or smaller as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Save:** After placing and adjusting the signature, save the document by going to "File" and selecting "Save As" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Assign a new name to distinguish the signed version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

The process is straightforward and results in a signed PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

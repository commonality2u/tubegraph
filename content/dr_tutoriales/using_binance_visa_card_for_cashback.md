## Using Binance Visa Card for Cashback

Binance offers a Visa card that provides benefits, including refunds or cashback, on payments made with the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This feature allows users to receive a percentage of their spending back, depending on the amount of BNB (Binance Coin) they hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

### How Cashback Works

The refund percentage received when using the Binance Visa card is directly tied to the amount of BNB held by the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. For example, holding ten BNB can result in a two percent refund on payments made with the Binance card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. Users will receive a refund whenever they pay with the card, provided they meet certain BNB holding thresholds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.

### The Role of BNB

Holding BNB plays a crucial role in enhancing benefits on Binance, including reducing commissions and improving terms with the Visa card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. The amount of BNB held directly influences the cashback percentage received from the Binance Visa card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

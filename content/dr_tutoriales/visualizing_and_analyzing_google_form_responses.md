## Ways to View Responses

Google Forms provides different ways to visualize collected data:

### Summary View
The summary view provides an overview of all responses globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This is generally preferred for seeing aggregated responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For multiple-choice questions, you can see how respondents answered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The summary can include insights on related tutorial topics, satisfaction levels, and other questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Question View
The "Question" tab allows you to view responses organized by each specific question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, for "Question 1," you can see all the responses to that particular question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Individual View
The "Individual" view lets you examine the responses of each person separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This is useful for reviewing individual exams or question sets answered by specific individuals like Jesus, John, or Antonio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Exporting Responses

While the online interface provides an intuitive way to visualize responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, you can also [[exporting_google_form_responses_to_csv_or_excel | export them for further analysis]]:

### Using Google Sheets
To [[using_google_sheets_with_google_forms | view responses in Google Sheets]], click "View in Sheets" at the top of the Responses tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Responses in [[using_google_sheets_with_google_forms | Google Sheets]] are grouped by timestamp, showing the date, hour, and minute of submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Individual responses are listed below the timestamp, including details like email, tutorial topic, satisfaction, questions, platform used, and whether the respondent subscribed to a channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### CSV/Excel
Responses can also be [[exporting_google_form_responses_to_csv_or_excel | exported to Excel]] in [[exporting_google_form_responses_to_csv_or_excel | CSV format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

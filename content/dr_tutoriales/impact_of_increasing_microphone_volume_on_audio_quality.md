Increasing the volume of a microphone on a computer or laptop can facilitate subsequent editing and allow subscribers and listeners to hear with perfect clarity when streaming or on other platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, there are considerations regarding how this adjustment impacts audio quality.

## Understanding Microphone Volume Limits

Each microphone has a maximum volume it can capture without reducing sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. If the microphone's volume is increased beyond this limit, the sound quality can decrease considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Conversely, keeping the volume at or below this maximum ensures it stays within the quality allowed by the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

The standard volume for a microphone, which maintains quality, is often noted at 0.0 decibels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Adjusting Volume on Windows 10

To [[how_to_increase_microphone_volume_on_windows_10 | increase microphone volume on Windows 10]] while considering quality:
1.  Go to the Start taskbar and search for "sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Sound settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
3.  Select the "Input" section, as "Output" refers to speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
4.  Ensure the desired microphone is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
5.  Click on "Device properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
6.  In [[using_device_properties_to_manage_microphone_settings | device properties]], the microphone volume is displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
7.  If a different window appears (common for Windows 10), go to the "Levels" section to adjust the microphone level, typically set at 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Volume Increase vs. Audio Quality Trade-off (Software Methods)

When using specific programs for recording, such as ABS Raw or VSR, it is possible to record videos at desired volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. These programs can also facilitate passing audio at higher volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

One [[methods_to_enhance_audio_volume_during_recording | method to enhance audio volume]] within such software involves using the audio mixer:
1.  Go to the "microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
2.  Access "settings" and then "properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
4.  In the "audio mixer" window, right-click and select "Advanced audio properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
5.  Here, the volume of the chosen microphone can be increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

When increasing volume beyond the standard 0.0 decibels, it's important to note that this technique can increase the volume but may also decrease the quality of the audio, making it sound "a little worse but higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This trade-off must be kept in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Binance's Liquid Swap, also known as Liquid Pool, is a financial product that allows users to invest their cryptocurrencies and other financial assets to earn profitability within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. It is designed to provide liquidity to the market, enabling others to buy, [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_Binance | convert]], [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_Binance | exchange]], or sell various digital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## How Liquid Swap Works

Participants in Liquid Swap provide liquidity by contributing their cryptocurrencies or other assets like euros or dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. In return, they earn profitability based on the commissions from transactions carried out by other users with these contributed coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### Accessing Liquid Swap

To access Liquid Swap:
1.  Navigate to the "finance" section within the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  Locate the "Liquid Swap" option, which may be labeled as "new" or "become a provider of liquidity and double your Profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Understanding Profitability and Risks

[[understanding_the_risks_and_profitability_of_liquid_swap | Profitability]] in Liquid Swap is displayed as an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) over seven days, for example, 7.80% to 44.00% weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It's crucial to understand that these values are not fixed and constantly change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. They depend heavily on the volume of transactions for the specific cryptocurrencies in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Key Considerations for Profitability

*   **Volatility:** The profitability is not guaranteed and can fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. There can be periods with negative values if the price of the contributed cryptocurrencies depreciates faster than the earned commissions from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Volume:** It is recommended to use Liquid Swap with cryptocurrencies that have a high trading volume. This helps reduce risk and minimize potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Holding Period:** To maximize profitability, it is advisable to leave money deposited for a relatively medium to long timeframe, allowing users to make transactions with the contributed funds and generate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Types of Liquidity Pools

Binance offers two main types of liquidity pools:
*   **Stable Liquidity:** These products generally have profitability that does not vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Innovation Liquidity:** These products tend to have more variable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Adding and Withdrawing Liquidity

Users can choose to add or withdraw liquidity they have contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Adding Liquidity
When adding liquidity, users are often given the option to contribute either a pair of currencies (e.g., Bitcoin and BUSD) or a single currency (e.g., Bitcoin only or BUSD only) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Adding a pair of currencies:** Contributing both currencies in a pair typically incurs no commission for adding liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Adding a single currency:** Contributing only one currency (e.g., Bitcoin or BUSD separately) will incur a commission, making it less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Withdrawing Liquidity
Users can withdraw their participation from a liquidity pool, such as Bitcoin and BUSD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. However, withdrawing funds typically incurs commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Monitoring Participation
Users can view their contributions and daily performance by going to "my participation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This section displays the total yield and daily profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. A history of adding and withdrawing liquidity is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

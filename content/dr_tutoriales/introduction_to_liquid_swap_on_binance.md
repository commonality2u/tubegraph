[[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]] is a financial product offered by [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] designed to help users invest their cryptocurrencies and financial assets to achieve profitability [00:00:05]. It is also referred to as "Liquid Pull" [00:00:05].

## How Liquid Swap Works

The fundamental concept behind [[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]] is to provide liquidity to the market [00:01:37]. Users contribute their cryptocurrencies or other assets, such as euros or dollars, to a pool [00:01:41]. This supplied liquidity enables other users to buy, convert, exchange, or sell these coins [00:01:49]. In return, the liquidity providers earn commissions from the transactions carried out using the pooled assets [00:01:52]. Profitability is directly linked to the volume of transactions [00:02:05].

### Accessing Liquid Swap

To access [[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]] on the [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] platform, navigate to the "finance" section [00:01:15]. Within this section, locate the part that is marked as "new" and promotes becoming a "provider of liquidity and double your profits" [00:01:24].

### Profitability and Risks

Profitability in [[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]] is often displayed as an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) [00:02:22]. This value is not fixed and fluctuates based on the amount of transactions for the specific cryptocurrencies in the pool [00:02:34].

> [!caution] Risk of Negative Returns
> It is crucial to understand that profitability is not always guaranteed [00:04:29]. There is a risk of experiencing negative returns [00:04:33]. This occurs if the price of the cryptocurrencies contributed to the pool depreciates faster than the commissions earned from transactions [00:05:09]. The balance of depreciation can outweigh the transaction commissions, leading to a loss [00:04:53].

To mitigate risk, it is recommended to use [[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]] with cryptocurrencies that have a high trading volume [00:02:41]. This helps reduce risk and minimize potential losses [00:02:47].

[[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]] offers different liquidity products:
*   **Stable Liquidity:** Products where profitability does not vary significantly [00:02:53].
*   **Innovation Liquidity:** Products where profitability can vary more [00:03:00].

### Adding and Withdrawing Liquidity

Users can choose to add or withdraw liquidity [00:03:06].

*   **Adding Liquidity:**
    *   Adding two currencies simultaneously (e.g., Bitcoin and BUSD) incurs no commission [00:03:31].
    *   Adding only one currency (e.g., Bitcoin alone) will incur a commission, making it less profitable [00:03:41].
*   **Withdrawing Liquidity:**
    *   Commissions may be charged when withdrawing capital [00:06:52].
    *   The platform is designed for users to leave their money deposited for a relatively average to long timeframe to maximize profitability [00:07:01].

Before using the product, it is advised to read the terms and conditions [00:03:58].

*   Total yield achieved [00:05:54].
*   Daily yield [00:06:00].

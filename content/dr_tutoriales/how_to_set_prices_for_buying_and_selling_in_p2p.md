[[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P (peer-to-peer) payments]] involve direct [[currency_exchange using p2p | currency exchange]] between different users, offering an alternative to traditional bank exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Understanding how prices are set and evaluated is crucial for effective [[p2p_trading_method_on_binance | P2P trading]].

## Understanding Price Dynamics

When engaging in [[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P commerce]], you will encounter different price setting mechanisms:
*   **Selling Cryptocurrencies** If you intend to sell, you will set the price for your exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.
*   **Buying Cryptocurrencies** If you intend to buy, the price will be set by the other person (the seller), and you must decide whether to accept or reject that offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>.

### Key Factors to Consider for Pricing

Several elements influence the profitability and feasibility of a P2P transaction:

1.  **Price and Commission Graphs**
    It is essential to consider the price and commission graphs that will be charged for any exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:29">[00:30:29]</a>. Always check the current market price of the cryptocurrency you are trading, such as Bitcoin, to determine if the P2P offer is profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>. The price displayed in P2P offers can vary significantly depending on the person who placed the offer and the time it was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:42">[02:40:42]</a>. For example, a Bitcoin might be listed at 36,000 euros in a P2P offer when the market price is actually 27,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. This highlights the importance of checking market graphs before purchasing via the [[p2p_trading_method_on_binance | P2P method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:56">[03:56:56]</a>.

2.  **Cryptocurrency Volatility**
    Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:53">[02:53:53]</a>. Their value can change drastically from one day to the next, so constant monitoring of market prices is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:57">[02:57:57]</a>.

3.  **Payment Method**
    The chosen [[peer_to_peer_payments | payment method]] significantly impacts the availability of offers and potentially their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:03">[03:03:03]</a>. Not all users are willing to use every payment method, as preferences may vary due to country-specific conditions, political situations, or economic factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. Common methods include bank transfers and PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:33">[03:33:33]</a>. Filtering by a specific payment method will show only users willing to use that method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.

4.  **User Ratings**
    User ratings are a very important factor to consider in [[peer_to_peer_payments | P2P transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:03">[04:03:03]</a>. The rating reflects the number of [[p2p_trading_method_on_binance | P2P transactions]] a user has completed and the percentage that were successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:11">[04:11:11]</a>. After a transaction, you can rate the other user based on speed, ease, and correct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:17">[04:17:17]</a>. While not directly a pricing factor, trust in a seller (indicated by high completion rates) influences whether a buyer will engage, indirectly affecting which prices are viable. Users can see a user's order count and completion percentage below their name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:35">[04:35:35]</a>.

### Strategic Buying and Selling

The fundamental goal in [[strategic_buying_and_selling_in_cryptocurrency_markets | P2P trading]] is to [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buy at a lower price]] than the market rate and [[selling_bitcoin_and_converting_to_other_cryptocurrencies | sell at a higher price]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>.

### Performing a P2P Transaction (Binance Example)

To engage in P2P commerce on Binance, you must first transfer the desired capital to your P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:49">[05:49:49]</a>. This is done by transferring from your fiat spot wallet to the P2P balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:57">[05:57:57]</a>. Once funds are in the P2P wallet, you can proceed to make or accept offers.

For example, when buying Bitcoin, you would:
1.  Navigate to the [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | 'Buy Crypto']] section and select [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | 'P2P Commerce']] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>.
2.  Choose the currency you are working with (e.g., Euros) and the cryptocurrency you wish to buy (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:31">[01:30:31]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount you are willing to pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:56">[01:56:56]</a>.
4.  Browse available offers, noting the price, amount limits set by the seller, and their completion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>.
5.  If you find a suitable offer, you would initiate the purchase. A pop-up window will show the maximum and minimum amounts you can transact with that specific seller and the amount you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:21">[07:20:21]</a>.
6.  The seller will specify their preferred [[peer_to_peer_payments | payment method]] (e.g., bank transfer) and a payment time limit (e.g., 45 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:47">[07:46:47]</a>. Both parties must complete their transfers within this timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:52">[07:52:52]</a>.

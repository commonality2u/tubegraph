Managing digital certificates on mobile devices, such as embedding an electronic ID card certificate, requires specific steps and adherence to certain prerequisites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Embedding a Digital Certificate
Before attempting to embed a digital certificate on a mobile device, it is an indispensable [[requirements_for_embedding_a_digital_certificate | requirement]] that the digital certificate must first be installed on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Without completing this initial step on a computer, the subsequent process on a mobile device will not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Device Compatibility and NFC
The process for embedding digital certificates is applicable to both Android and iOS devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While the exact application interfaces may differ between platforms, the overall process remains consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### NFC Antenna Activation
*   **Android:** On Android devices, it is necessary to [[activating_and_using_nfc_on_mobile_phones | activate the NFC antenna]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **iPhone:** On iPhone, the NFC antenna is already activated by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The NFC antenna is the technology that enables contactless payments, such as those made in establishments using a mobile wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Application Download and Installation
To proceed with embedding a digital certificate, a specific application must be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The application is typically named "Digital Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Users should search for it in their device's app store (e.g., App Store for iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

It is crucial to verify that the application's creator is a certified entity, such as "Digital Certificate FNT," to ensure the security and integrity of personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Process of Obtaining and Installing the Certificate
Once the certified application is downloaded, open it to begin the [[process_of_downloading_and_installing_the_digital_certificate | process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

Options within the app include:
*   Requesting a digital certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   Managing already [[installing_digital_certificates_on_iphone | installed digital certificates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

To obtain the certificate using an electronic ID (DNI):
1.  **Read the ID Chip:** Select the option to "read the chip of your ID E" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  **Accept Terms:** Accept the terms and conditions presented by the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
3.  **Email Verification:** Enter an email address and verify it by entering a code received via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
4.  **Enter DNI Codes:**
    *   Input the CAM code found on the physical electronic ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   Enter the PIN associated with the DNI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This PIN is typically set when the DNI is renewed or issued, or obtained at a police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
5.  **Scan DNI with Phone:** Place the physical ID card on a smooth surface and position the phone, without a case, near the top of the ID card (where the NFC antenna is located) until the chip is detected and read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
6.  **Confirmation and Download:**
    *   Confirm the certificate expedition request for the Citizen's Certificate issued by the National Factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   Once the certificate is validated and available, a notification will be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   Proceed to "Install on mobile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Accept terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Create a password for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Allow the website to download the profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
7.  **Final Installation on Device:** After the profile is downloaded, check the profile in the device settings (e.g., under VPN & Device Management on iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Install the profile by entering the device's code and the certificate password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Once these steps are completed, the digital certificate will be successfully installed and active on the mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

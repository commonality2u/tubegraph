This article outlines how to withdraw cryptocurrency capital from a platform to a bank account, covering various methods and associated fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The process is demonstrated using a mobile phone (iPhone, but applicable to Android) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## General Withdrawal Process

The first step is to open the cryptocurrency application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Before initiating a withdrawal, it is essential to identify the specific cryptocurrency you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

The process involves sending the cryptocurrency in question (e.g., BNB, Ethereum, Bitcoin) to a conventional exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, such as Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, or Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. These exchanges must support the withdrawal of funds to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Example: Trust Wallet to Binance

To send cryptocurrency, such as BNB, from Trust Wallet to Binance:
1.  Select "Send" from Trust Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  Specify the amount to send (e.g., $56 worth of BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
3.  On the receiving platform (Binance), select "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  Choose the cryptocurrency (e.g., BNB) and the specific blockchain (e.g., Beacon Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
5.  Copy the wallet address and memo from the deposit section on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
6.  Paste the wallet address and memo into the Trust Wallet's send interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
7.  Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

#### Fees for Cryptocurrency Transfers
A commission fee may be charged for the transaction. For example, sending BNB from Trust Wallet to Binance incurred a fee of two cents on the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This falls under [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions]].

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat

Once the capital arrives in the exchange's Spot Wallet (e.g., Binance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, the next step is to convert the cryptocurrency to a fiat currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "Trade" section on the exchange platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  Select "Convert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency (e.g., BNB) to convert and the desired fiat currency (e.g., EUR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Fiat Withdrawal Methods

After converting the cryptocurrency to fiat, you can proceed with withdrawing the funds. This process is part of [[fiat_deposit_and_withdrawal_methods]].

1.  From the Spot Wallet, select "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
2.  Choose "Fiat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
3.  Select the fiat currency to withdraw (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
4.  Specify the amount to withdraw and the desired transaction type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This allows for [[using_different_payment_methods_for_transactions]].

### Available Withdrawal Methods:

*   **SEPA Bank Transfer:** A standard method for bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Visa Banking Card:** Funds can also be withdrawn to a Visa debit or credit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This relates to [[adding_and_using_debit_credit_cards_for_withdrawals]].
*   **Commission-Free Method:** A separate tutorial is available for a method that charges no commission for sending deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This method, detailed in other tutorials, also involves the use of cards on the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

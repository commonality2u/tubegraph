iPhone users can manage [[privacy_and_security_settings_on_iOS | privacy and security settings]] to control how individual applications access their device's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This allows for granular control over [[customizing_location_usage_settings | location usage settings]] for specific apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Accessing Location Settings

To manage location settings:
1.  Navigate to the "Settings" application on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
2.  Scroll down and select "Privacy & Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>, identified by a blue hand symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
3.  Within "Privacy & Security," locate and tap on "Location" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## System-Wide Location Services

Inside the "Location" section, you will find options for location services. It is possible to [[how_to_deactivate_location_services_on_iOS | deactivate location services]] entirely for all applications from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Individual App Location Permissions

Beyond the general toggle, users can manage location access for specific applications individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. For each app listed, you can select one of the following permissions:
*   **While Using the App**: Location services are active only when the app is in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Ask Next Time or When I Share**: The app will prompt you for location access each time it is requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Never**: The app is prevented from accessing your location at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Always**: The app can access your location even when it is not actively in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

These options allow users to manage their phone's location based on specific applications or the intended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Some applications, like Uber or Bolt, often require location services to function properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Increasing your microphone's volume on a computer or laptop can greatly assist in subsequent editing, and ensure clearer audio for streaming or other platforms, allowing subscribers and listeners to hear with perfect clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Method 1: Adjusting Sound Settings in Windows 10

This method directly utilizes the Windows 10 sound settings to [[adjusting_sound_settings_for_microphones | adjust sound settings for microphones]] and [[methods_to_enhance_audio_volume_during_recording | enhance audio volume]].

1.  **Access Sound Settings**: Go to the Start taskbar and type "sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Select "Sound settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Input**: Within the sound settings, choose the "Input" section, not "Output," as "Output" refers to speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
3.  **Select Microphone**: Ensure the desired microphone is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
4.  **Access Device Properties**: Click on "[[using_device_properties_to_manage_microphone_settings | Device properties]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Microphone Volume**: In the device properties window, the microphone volume can be set. It's often at 100%, which represents the maximum volume the microphone can capture without reducing sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Increasing the volume beyond this point or excessively can lead to a considerable [[impact_of_increasing_microphone_volume_on_audio_quality | decrease in sound quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
6.  **Alternative (Older Windows 10 versions)**: For some Windows 10 computers, a different window might appear. In this case, go to the "Levels" tab, where the microphone volume can also be found at 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Apply the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Method 2: Using an External Program (e.g., OBS Studio)

An external program, often referred to as "ABS Raw" (likely OBS Studio), can also be used to [[methods_to_enhance_audio_volume_during_recording | record videos at higher volumes]] and [[methods_to_enhance_audio_volume_during_recording | enhance audio volume]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This program facilitates passing audio at higher volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

1.  **Select Microphone within the Program**: Go to the "microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Access Properties**: Click "settings" then "properties" to choose the microphone you wish to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  **Use Audio Mixer**: Navigate to the "audio mixer" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
4.  **Advanced Audio Properties**: Right-click on the audio mixer and select "Advanced Audio Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
5.  **Adjust Volume**: Here, you will see different microphones or audios involved in the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. The standard volume is 0.0 decibels, which represents 100% of the previously selected volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
6.  **Consider Quality Impact**: While volume can be progressively increased, this technique may [[impact_of_increasing_microphone_volume_on_audio_quality | decrease the quality of the audio]], making it sound a bit worse but louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This trade-off between volume and quality should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Decentralized Finance (Defi) staking on Binance allows users to earn profitability on their cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While it offers the potential for high returns, it's important to understand the associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Accessing Defi Staking on Binance

To find Defi staking options on Binance:
1.  Navigate to the "Earn" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Locate it within the "High-risk products" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  Select "Defi" or "Defi Staking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Understanding Defi

Defi is inspired by blockchain technology, similar to the technology behind Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It enables multiple entities to hold copies of transactions, meaning it's not controlled by a single, central source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

While many people believe Defi is the future of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, it is not considered a very safe product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. However, it can yield significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Risks and Profitability

Binance acts solely as a service platform for Defi, meaning it does not guarantee that projects will always function or that profitability will always be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
> [!WARNING] High Risk
> Defi programs expose users to high risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Losses can occur due to vulnerabilities in the project's contract or underlying blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. It's crucial to research the project and cryptocurrency involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

Profitability from Defi can be very good, sometimes exceeding 30% or even 100% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. However, the Annual Percentage Yield (API) is variable and adjusts daily based on chain rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Distinguishing Projects
There are both good and bad Defi projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It is crucial to inform yourself about the project, the cryptocurrency you are investing in, and analyze the returns it offers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. It is recommended to start with a small capital to gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Defi Staking Options

When viewing Defi staking options, you'll find columns detailing:
*   Annual profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Minimum locked amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
*   "Subscribe" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>

Two main types of Defi staking duration are available: [[understanding_flexible_and_locked_defi_staking | Flexible Lock]] and [[understanding_flexible_and_locked_defi_staking | Locked]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### [[understanding_flexible_and_locked_defi_staking | Flexible vs. Locked Defi Staking]]

*   **[[understanding_flexible_and_locked_defi_staking | Flexible Lock]]**: Allows you to deposit cryptocurrencies and remove them whenever you wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **[[understanding_flexible_and_locked_defi_staking | Locked Defi]]**: Requires your cryptocurrencies to be held for a fixed period, such as 7 or 30 days, depending on your selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Normally, longer locked periods would yield greater profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, this isn't always the case; some options may offer the same annual return regardless of the lock-up duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Investing in Defi Staking

When subscribing to a Defi project:
1.  Choose between "Flexible" or "Locked" types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
2.  Enter the desired investment amount. There will be a minimum and maximum limit, which can vary with the duration chosen for locked staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
3.  Review the value date, interest period, interest end date, and refund date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
4.  Crucially, accept and read the Defi agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. This agreement outlines the terms and risks, including Binance's non-responsibility for losses due to contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Monitoring Your Defi Investment

To view your Defi investments:
1.  Go to the "Wallet" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Earn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
3.  Select "Defi" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
4.  You can then choose to view either your flexible or locked Defi holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

From here, you can monitor the cumulative profitability of your cryptocurrency and see your current earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. For flexible staking, you can remove your funds at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. For locked staking, you'll need to wait until the locked period ends to remove your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

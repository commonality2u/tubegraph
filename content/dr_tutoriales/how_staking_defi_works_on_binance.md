Even if you already have an account, it's recommended to use it for long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Accessing DeFi Staking on Binance

To access DeFi staking, navigate to the "Earn" section on the Binance page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Within "Earn," you will find DeFi as part of the "high-risk products" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Select it to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Binance's DeFi platform offers mining projects, but it acts only as a service platform and does not guarantee that it will always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

## Understanding DeFi Staking [[risks_and_profitability_of_cryptocurrency_staking | Risks and Profitability]]

While DeFi programs can offer significant profitability for cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, they are also exposed to high risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. DeFi is built on blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, which allows multiple entities to hold a copy of transactions, meaning no single central source controls it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Despite its potential for high returns, DeFi is not considered a very safe product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Many believe it represents the future of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It is recommended to try it with a small amount of capital to gain initial experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

There are good and bad DeFi projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Binance states it is not responsible for losses due to contract vulnerabilities of projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. It is crucial to research the project and cryptocurrency you are investing in, as some projects have disappeared due to contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## How DeFi Staking Works on Binance

Upon entering the DeFi section, you will see a list of available staking options. Currently, many contracts like Bitcoin (BTC), BNB, USD, and USD are exhausted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. There may be limited options available, such as a cryptocurrency offering an 8.79% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Annual returns can exceed 30% or even 100% depending on the project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The staking options are presented with columns indicating:
*   Annual Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Minimum Amount Blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
*   Subscribe option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>

### [[explanation_of_flexible_and_locked_staking_options | Flexible and Locked Staking Options]]

Within the "Duration" column, you will find:
*   **Flexible Lock**: Allows you to deposit cryptocurrencies and remove them whenever you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Locked DeFi**: Requires your cryptocurrencies to be held for a set period, such as 7 or 30 days, depending on your selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Generally, locking your capital for more days within DeFi yields higher profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, this is not always the case; sometimes the annual percentage yield (APY) remains constant regardless of the lock duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The APY adjusts daily based on chain rewards and is not a fixed value; it can vary, and sometimes be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Subscription Process

When subscribing, you select the type (flexible or locked) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> and input the amount you wish to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. There are always minimum and maximum investment limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, which may vary for locked products depending on the duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

Details provided during subscription include:
*   Value date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   Interest period (e.g., one day) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
*   Interest end date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   Refund date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>

Before confirming, you must accept and read the DeFi agreement, which is often very long but necessary for understanding the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Managing and Storing Cryptocurrency on Binance

To view your DeFi investments, go to the "Wallet" section, then "Earn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. From there, navigate to the "DeFi" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. You can filter to see either flexible or locked investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This allows you to track the cumulative profitability of your cryptocurrency and see how much you have earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. If an investment is flexible, you can remove it at any moment from the flexible section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. If it's locked, you'll manage it from the locked section when the term ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Important Considerations

It is essential to analyze projects, stay informed, and understand where your money and cryptocurrencies are being invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For future tutorials, investing in Ethereum is highly recommended for DeFi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

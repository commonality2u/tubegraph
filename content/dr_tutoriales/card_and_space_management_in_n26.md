The [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] bank [[features_of_n26_bank_app | application]] offers comprehensive tools for managing both physical and virtual cards, as well as organizing finances through "Spaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This [[features_of_n26_bank_app | application]] is identical for both iPhone and Android users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The standard [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] account, which is free and does not require monthly payments, is primarily used for these operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Card Management

The [[n26_app_menu_navigation_and_setup | N26 app]] provides several options for managing your bank cards.

### Adding Funds to Your Account

To enable card functionality, such as ordering a physical card, you typically need a minimum balance (e.g., ten euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Funds can be added to your [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] account using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>:
*   Instant transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
*   Bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>
*   The first transfer via [[adding_and_using_debit_credit_cards_for_withdrawals | debit or credit card]] is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This method allows depositing money into your [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] account immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Virtual Card Usage

Upon funding your account (e.g., with fifty euros), a virtual card becomes active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This virtual card can be added to your mobile wallet, such as Apple Wallet for iPhones or Android Pay for Android devices, allowing for mobile payments even before receiving a physical card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The process involves accepting terms and conditions after verifying your card details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Ordering a Physical Card

A physical card can be ordered from within the [[features_of_n26_bank_app | application]] to facilitate [[adding_and_using_debit_credit_cards_for_withdrawals | withdrawals]] at ATMs and payments at stores that don't accept mobile payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Card Type**: The type of card available depends on your chosen account service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. For the free standard account, a transparent card is typically provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Other options include metal or black cards for premium accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Delivery**:
    *   Normal delivery costs ten euros and takes approximately two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   Express delivery is available for three business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   The order is confirmed within the [[n26_app_menu_navigation_and_setup | app]], and updates on shipping status are provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

### Card Settings

The [[features_of_n26_bank_app | N26 application]] allows for extensive control over your cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>:

## Space Management

"Spaces" in [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] are subaccounts designed to organize your money, allowing for diversification of your financial portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

### Functionality of Spaces

*   **Creation**: Users can create up to two "Space" subaccounts to manage their money, separating funds for different purposes like saving or spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Actions**: Within a space, you can receive money, send money, and modify its settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Customization**: Spaces can be personalized by renaming them or changing their image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. You can also view transaction excerpts specific to each space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Goal Setting**: Users can set savings goals within their spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Premium accounts like [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] Metal or [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] Smart offer more "Space" subaccounts (e.g., ten for [[introduction_to_n26_bank | N26]] Smart) and additional benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>.

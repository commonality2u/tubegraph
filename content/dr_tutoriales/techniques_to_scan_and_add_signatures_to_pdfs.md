## Preparing Your Signature

To add a signature to a PDF, you will need a digital version of your signature. This can be:
*   An image file (e.g., scanned or photographed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   A text-based signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   A drawn signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

If using an image, scan your signature or take a clear photo of it, then transfer it to your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

You have several choices for adding your signature:

For most general uses, a personal account is considered more than sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Business Account
A business account is designed for buying and selling mass products, preparing invoices, and selling anywhere to anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

This article outlines how to use a mobile application to view the metadata and geolocation information associated with photos taken on a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process allows users to [[how_to_determine_photo_location_on_mobile_devices | determine photo location on mobile devices]] and access details about the image and the device it was taken with.

## The Xip App

To access photo metadata, a free application called "Xip" (also referred to as "Exif, metadata") can be downloaded from the Apple Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

The app is described as an orange icon with "photo, video" and has received 153 reviews with a 4.5-star rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The Xip app offers [[free_versus_pro_options_of_photo_location_apps | free versus Pro options of photo location apps]], with the free version being sufficient for basic use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Accessing Photo Data

Upon opening the app, users must allow it to access their photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This requires granting [[appspecific_location_permissions | app-specific location permissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The app displays a selection of photos, some with location data and others without <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Viewing Metadata and Geolocation

When a photo is selected, the app presents various details, including:
*   Image size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Camera details (e.g., iPhone model, lens information) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Longitude and latitude coordinates (geolocation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

This allows for [[viewing_and_editing_geolocation_and_metadata | viewing and editing geolocation and metadata]] directly within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Users can tap on a map within the app to see the exact location where the photo was taken, providing a precise geolocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The tutorial provides [[examples_and_use_cases_of_photo_geolocation | examples and use cases of photo geolocation]], showing photos taken in Bristol, UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, Niagara Falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, and Oxford <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Photos Without Geolocation

Not all mobile phones have geolocation activated when photos are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This setting can be managed in permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. If a photo's [[location_sharing_and_tracking_controls | location sharing and tracking controls]] were not enabled by the person who sent it, or if the metadata was stripped, the app will not display location information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[managing_location_settings_on_ios | managing location settings on iOS]] and understanding [[privacy_and_security_in_ios | privacy and security in iOS]] when sharing photos, as users can choose to [[disabling_iphone_location_services | disable iPhone location services]] for photos.

### Adding New Photos

To add more photos to the app for analysis, users can click the "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The app allows for selecting and adding photos from the device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Once added, the app will display the location and camera details for that specific photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

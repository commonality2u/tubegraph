User interaction, particularly through comments, plays a crucial role in the promotion and visibility of [[video_tutorial_creation | videos]] on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The more comments and interaction a video receives, the more YouTube is likely to promote it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This interaction, whether positive or negative, helps in positioning videos within the platform's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Activating Comments on YouTube Videos

To ensure comments are enabled on your videos, there are three important considerations within [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Consideration 1: Channel Advanced Settings

The first step is to check your channel's configuration:
1.  Go to [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
2.  Navigate to `Configuration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  Select `Channel` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
4.  In `Advanced Settings`, ensure your channel is *not* marked as "created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. If the channel is designated for children, comments will be banned across all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Consideration 2: Video Audience Setting

The second consideration involves the specific video's audience setting:
1.  In [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]], go to the `Details` of the desired video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  Check the section regarding whether the content is "created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
3.  If marked as "yes, it is content created for children", YouTube will block all comments for that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. To allow comments, ensure it is marked as "no, it is not content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Consideration 3: Video Comment Permissions

The final step is to explicitly allow comments within the video's specific settings:
1.  From the video's `Details` page, scroll down to `More options` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  Locate the `Comments and ratings` section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
3.  Select `Allow all comments` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Options like disabling comments are available, but choosing `Allow all comments` is necessary for user interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Managing Comments

Even when `Allow all comments` is selected, content creators can manage inappropriate comments by deleting them upon receiving notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This helps maintain the video's dynamics and respectful discourse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

YouTube has a default restriction that prevents channels from [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | uploading videos]] with a duration greater than fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. If you attempt to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload a video]] exceeding this limit without the necessary permission, the video will be blocked and often get stuck at 99% processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is not an error but a permission that needs to be enabled for new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Enabling Longer Video Uploads

To lift the 15-minute duration restriction and enable [[requirements_for_uploading_longer_videos_on_youtube | uploading longer videos]], follow these steps:

### 1. Access YouTube Studio

Begin by navigating to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] for the channel you wish to update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. For a quicker process, switch to the classic version of [[youtube_studio_features_for_enabling_long_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

### 2. Navigate to Channel Settings

Once in the classic version of [[youtube_studio_features_for_enabling_long_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], click on the "Channel" option located in the left-hand panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section displays various permissions and options for your channel, such as [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | uploads]], monetization, and live broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Look for the setting related to "longer lasting videos" (or similar wording indicating extended duration videos) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This specific setting controls the ability to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos]] exceeding fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. By default, if it's not enabled, it will likely show "No" or a similar indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### 3. Account Verification Process

To enable the option for longer videos, you will need to [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | verify your account]]. This verification can be completed from a computer, Android device, or iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

> [!INFO] Verification Method
> YouTube will send a confirmation code to your registered mobile phone number or email address (Gmail or other linked email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. You will use this code to confirm that you are the legitimate owner of the YouTube account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Once your account is successfully [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | verified]] and the "longer lasting videos" option is enabled, you will be able to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos]] that exceed fifteen minutes in duration without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

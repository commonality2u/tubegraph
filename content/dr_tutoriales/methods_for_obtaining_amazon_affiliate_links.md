[[creating_amazon_affiliate_links | Obtaining Amazon affiliate links]] allows individuals to share products, leading to purchases and subsequent commissions [00:00:06]. A previously made video tutorial discusses a WordPress plugin for advertising Amazon products without requiring the API code [00:00:19]. The API code, which enables product promotion, becomes available after an individual makes three sales [00:00:27].

Before proceeding, it is necessary to have an [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | Amazon Affiliates account]] [00:00:08]. The process for [[steps_to_fill_out_the_amazon_affiliates_application | creating an account]] is described as very easy and quick, taking about five minutes [00:01:04].

## Method 1: Using the Amazon Affiliates Platform

This method involves direct interaction with the [[navigating_the_amazon_affiliates_platform | Amazon Affiliates platform]]:
1.  **Access the Platform**: After logging in, navigate to the Amazon Affiliates screen [00:01:17].
2.  **Locate Product Links**: Find the "Product Links" tab and select the first option, also called "Product Links" [00:01:20].
3.  **Search for Products**: A search engine is available to find any product within Amazon [00:01:30]. For instance, searching for "Call of Duty PlayStation 4" will display all related products available on Amazon [00:01:36]. The system indicates the number of results found, such as 845 searches for "Call of Duty PlayStation 4" [00:01:48].
4.  **Generate a Long Link**: To obtain a link for a specific product, click the small arrow next to it [00:02:04]. This action provides a long link that can be copied and pasted to promote the product [00:02:04].
5.  **Generate a Short Link**: For a more concise and visually appealing link, click the arrow again [00:02:26]. An option will appear to "shorten the URL with the name of the link" [00:02:32]. Selecting this will generate a shorter Amazon affiliate link [00:02:37]. This link can then be copied and pasted onto a website, potentially using a plugin mentioned earlier in the video [00:02:39].

## Method 2: Using the Amazon Associates SiteStripe on the Amazon Official Page

This method utilizes a feature available directly on the main Amazon website for those with an [[using_amazon_affiliate_account | Amazon Affiliates account]]:
1.  **Navigate to Amazon.com**: Go to the official Amazon website where products are displayed [00:02:58].
2.  **Identify the Amazon Web Bar Affiliates**: At the top of the page, a taskbar labeled "Amazon Web Bar Affiliates" (also known as SiteStripe) will appear [00:03:10]. This utility is exclusively available to registered Amazon Affiliates accounts [00:03:15].
3.  **Select a Product**: Any product found on Amazon can have its link generated using this web bar [00:03:20]. For example, searching for "toilet paper" and selecting a product [00:03:38].
4.  **Obtain the Link**: On the product page, locate the Amazon affiliate web bar (SiteStripe) on the top left [00:03:42]. It offers two main options:
    *   **Text Format**: This option allows you to get the link in text format [00:03:49]. You can choose the affiliate ID (tracking ID) for [[using_keywords_and_tracking_ids_for_amazon_affiliate_marketing | tracking purposes]] [00:04:00]. It also provides the choice between a short link or a full link, depending on preference [00:04:20].
    *   **Text + Image**: This option provides a different link that, when clicked, will open the product page in a new tab [00:04:28]. This feature is useful as it prevents users from leaving the original website, maintaining [[generating_revenue_through_amazon_affiliate_program | tracking]] [00:04:38].

Once the desired link is generated, it simply needs to be copied and placed on a website or any page where Amazon products are being promoted [00:04:45].

Both methods for [[generating_commissions_from_amazon_affiliates | obtaining Amazon affiliate links]] are straightforward and easy to use [00:04:53]. These methods contribute to the [[benefits_of_amazon_affiliates_program | Amazon Affiliates program's]] utility for promoters.

Withdrawing capital from the KuCoin platform directly to a bank account is an indirect process [00:00:05]. KuCoin does not offer a direct option to withdraw national (fiat) currencies, only registered cryptocurrencies [00:02:06]. This is because an intermediary company facilitates fiat deposits but does not perform the same function for withdrawals [00:02:24].

To withdraw funds, you must first transfer your cryptocurrencies from KuCoin to a different platform that supports fiat withdrawals to a bank account [00:02:39]. Examples of such platforms include [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | Coinbase]] or Kraken [00:03:15].

## Transferring Cryptocurrency from KuCoin

The first step is to transfer your cryptocurrency from KuCoin to a platform like Kraken or [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | Coinbase]] [00:02:39].

### 1. Access Assets on KuCoin
On the KuCoin platform, navigate to the "assets" section to view all your portfolios, including the main account, trading account, and pool account [00:01:27].

### 2. Initiate Cryptocurrency Withdrawal
While you'll see options for both cryptocurrency and fiat currency deposits on KuCoin [00:01:40], the withdrawal option only allows for cryptocurrency withdrawals, not national currencies [00:02:06]. Select the "withdraw" button [00:02:01].

### 3. Obtain Deposit Address from a Compatible Platform
Before withdrawing, you need a deposit address from the platform you'll use for fiat withdrawal (e.g., Kraken or [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | Coinbase]]) [00:03:00].
*   **For [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | Coinbase]]:** Go to "send or receive" and select "receive" [00:04:00]. Choose the cryptocurrency you intend to receive, such as USDT (Tether) [00:04:14].
*   **For Kraken:** Navigate to "funds" and find the cryptocurrency you want to deposit, for example, USDT [00:05:11]. Select "deposit" and then "generate deposit address" [00:05:24]. Copy this address [00:05:51].

### 4. Choose a Low-Commission Network
When selecting the network for your cryptocurrency transfer, consider the associated commissions [00:04:47]. Networks like ERC20 can have very high fees (e.g., $20-25 for USDT) [00:04:54]. Opt for a cheaper network if available, such as TRC20, which can significantly reduce the transaction fee (e.g., $1 for USDT) [00:06:34].

### 5. Confirm Withdrawal on KuCoin
Paste the copied deposit address from your secondary platform into the KuCoin withdrawal interface [00:06:01]. Enter the amount you wish to withdraw and add any observations [00:06:06]. Confirm the transaction and enter your trade code to finalize the transfer [00:06:26]. The transaction status can be viewed in the "withdrawal history" section on KuCoin [00:07:59].

## Withdrawing from the Secondary Platform to a Bank Account

Once the cryptocurrency funds arrive on your chosen secondary platform (e.g., Kraken or [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | Coinbase]]), you can proceed with converting them to fiat currency and withdrawing to your bank account [00:07:16].

### 1. Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat
On the secondary platform, convert your received cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) into your desired fiat currency (e.g., Euros or Dollars) [00:07:16].
*   On Kraken, go to the "prices" section, set prices based on the euro, and then use the "buy and sell" or "exchange" option to sell your USDT for EUR [00:10:37]. For larger amounts or to save on commissions, consider using Kraken Pro [00:10:15].

### 2. Initiate Fiat Withdrawal
Once converted to fiat, navigate to the "funds" section on the secondary platform, where your Euros (or other fiat currency) should now appear [00:11:45]. Select the "withdraw" option [00:11:57].

### 3. Add Bank Account Details
You will be prompted to add a bank account [00:12:01]. Options typically include wire transfer (SWIFT) or direct bank transfer [00:12:05].

### Bank Account Compatibility
It's important to note that some conventional banks (e.g., Santander, BBVA, ING) may block transactions with crypto exchanges [00:09:01]. To avoid this, it is recommended to use neo-banks like Revolut, N26, or "Living" (potentially a specific regional neo-bank mentioned in the video) [00:09:15]. These neo-banks are generally free to use and more accepting of transactions from crypto exchanges [00:09:23].

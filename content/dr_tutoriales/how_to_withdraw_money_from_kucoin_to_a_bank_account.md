This tutorial explains how to withdraw capital from the KuCoin platform to a bank account in an easy and understandable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This process is useful for withdrawing earnings or if you need the money and no longer wish to invest it on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Important Notes Before Starting

*   **Referral Link**: A referral link is available in the first comment of the video, offering a 10% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **KuCoin Staking**: A playlist is available in the video's cards on how to invest subscribed coins in KuCoin products like staking on flexible terms, which helps profit from existing cryptocurrencies through compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Understanding KuCoin Withdrawals

KuCoin's platform allows you to view all your portfolios under the "Assets" section, including the main account, trading account, and pool account, each with a specific function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

While KuCoin facilitates deposits of both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies (national currencies like Euro, Dollar, Pound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, it generally does not offer a direct option to withdraw national currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Why Direct Fiat Withdrawal Isn't Available

When you deposit national currencies into KuCoin, an intermediary company handles the transfer between your bank and KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This same intermediary company does not perform the withdrawal function, which is why direct fiat withdrawal is not supported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This is considered a somewhat negative aspect of the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Withdrawal Process

To withdraw capital from KuCoin to your bank account, you need to transfer your cryptocurrencies from KuCoin to another platform that *does* support fiat withdrawals to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Platforms like [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Coinbase]] and Kraken are examples of exchanges that allow [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | transferring cryptocurrency to a bank account]] via bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Step 1: Select a Cryptocurrency to Transfer

Choose a cryptocurrency with relatively cheap blockchain transaction fees for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. For example, USDT (Tether) is a good choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### Step 2: Choose a Secondary Platform (e.g., Kraken or Coinbase)

You will need an account on a platform like Kraken or [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Coinbase]] that supports direct bank withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Referral links for these platforms are also available in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Step 3: Generate a Deposit Address on the Secondary Platform

1.  **On Coinbase**: Go to "Send or Receive," then select "Receive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Select USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Be aware that the ERC-20 network (Ethereum blockchain) often has very high commissions (e.g., $20-25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
2.  **On Kraken**: Go to "Funds," then find USDT and select "Deposit" (the arrow pointing down) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Generate a deposit address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. For USDT, the TRC-20 network typically has much lower fees (e.g., 1 USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Copy this address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

    *   **Important**: The network chosen (e.g., ERC-20 vs. TRC-20) significantly affects transaction fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Always aim for the cheapest commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Step 4: Withdraw (Send) Cryptocurrency from KuCoin

1.  On KuCoin, go to the "Assets" section and click the "Withdraw" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02">[02:02]</a>.
2.  Select the cryptocurrency you wish to send (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
3.  Paste the deposit address copied from Kraken (or Coinbase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
5.  Select the correct network (e.g., TRC-20 for USDT on Kraken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. KuCoin may automatically detect the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
6.  Confirm the transaction, entering your trade code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
7.  The transaction should complete successfully, and the cryptocurrency will appear in your secondary platform's wallet within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. You can check the withdrawal history on KuCoin under "Files" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

### Step 5: Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency on the Secondary Platform (e.g., Kraken)

1.  Once the USDT arrives on Kraken, you need to convert it to your desired fiat currency (e.g., Euros, Dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Prices" section and set the prices based on the Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
3.  Search for USDT/EUR and select "Buy and Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
4.  Choose the "Advanced Option" and select "Sell USDT/EUR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
5.  Enter the quantity of USDT you wish to sell (e.g., 20 USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
6.  Select a "Market Order" type for quick execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
7.  Confirm the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
8.  After the order is sent, your funds will appear in Euros in your "Funds" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

    *   **Tip on Fees**: While the main Kraken platform charges a normal commission for conversion, using "Kraken Pro" can result in much lower transaction fees, especially for larger capital amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### Step 6: Withdraw Fiat Currency to Your Bank Account

1.  From the "Funds" section on Kraken, select "Withdraw" (the little arrow pointing up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
2.  You can add a bank account or choose to withdraw via wire transfer or card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
3.  Enter your bank account details. The money should arrive immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

    *   **Recommended Bank Accounts**: Conventional banks (e.g., Santander, BBVA, ING) may block transactions with crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. It's recommended to use neo-banks like N26 or Revolut, which typically allow these transactions and often offer free accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Tutorials for setting up accounts with these neo-banks are available in the video's cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. If a transfer is blocked, the money typically returns to the Kraken platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

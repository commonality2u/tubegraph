This article provides a guide on how to apply subscript formatting in Excel, based on a tutorial using an Excel document from a degree project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This method is applicable for displaying values in cells and within [[Excel graph formatting | graphs]] that require [[Subindices in Excel | subindices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Traditional vs. Proper Subscript Formatting

Traditionally, users might indicate [[Subindices in Excel | subindices]] by placing an arrow pointing down next to the number, suggesting it should be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. However, Excel offers a dedicated feature for proper subscript formatting where the text is actually lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Steps to Apply Subscript Formatting

To correctly apply subscript formatting to text or numbers in an Excel cell:

1.  **Select the Character(s)**: Highlight the specific number or character within the cell that you wish to convert to a subscript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Open Format Cells**: Click the small arrow located in the 'Font' group on the Excel ribbon, which opens the 'Format Cells' dialog box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  **Select Subscript**: In the 'Format Cells' dialog box, under the 'Font' tab, locate and check the "Subscript" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. (In the tutorial, this option is referred to as "subscribe" or "index down" from Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.)
4.  **Confirm**: Click 'OK' to apply the formatting. The selected character will now appear below the normal text line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

### Visual Confirmation

Once applied, the subscript will be visibly lower than the regular text in the cell, especially when viewed in the worksheet, even if the text in the formula bar appears as normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

## Applying Subscript to Graphs

The same method can be used to apply [[Subindices in Excel | subindices]] to text within an [[Excel graph formatting | Excel graph]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. For instance, a density graph might require a number in a subscript position, which can be achieved through the same 'Format Cells' process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. After applying, the number will appear correctly formatted as a subscript within the graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The process for applying [[Superindices in Excel | superindices in Excel]] is similar; instead of "Subscript," you would select "Superscript" in the 'Format Cells' dialog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

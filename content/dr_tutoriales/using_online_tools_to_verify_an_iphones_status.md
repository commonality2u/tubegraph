Verifying an iPhone's status is a simple yet crucial step, especially when considering the purchase of a second-hand device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This process helps determine if a device has been reported as stolen, lost, or disappeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## What You'll Need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

To check an iPhone's status, you will need two things:
1.  Access to a specific web page (the link is typically provided in the first comment of the associated video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
2.  The mobile device you intend to check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Importance of the IMEI Number

The core of this verification process relies on the iPhone's **IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This number serves as the unique identification number for that specific device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Every Apple device has an IMEI number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. If an iPhone is lost, stolen, or disappeared, the owner can communicate with Apple to register that IMEI number as belonging to a reported device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This registration is vital because if someone attempts to sell a reported iPhone, checking its IMEI will reveal its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Therefore, when purchasing a second-hand device, it is highly recommended to [[importance_of_checking_an_iphone_before_purchase | check the IMEI number]] to ensure the device is not stolen or missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### How to Find Your iPhone's IMEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>

You can find the IMEI number in several locations:

*   **On the Device Housing or SIM Card Adapter:** The IMEI may be physically printed on the device's casing or on the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Through iPhone Settings:**
    1.  Open the **Settings** app on your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    2.  Navigate to **General** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    3.  Tap on **Information** (or "About") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    4.  Scroll down to find the IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **For Locked or Newly Reset Devices:** If your device is locked or has just been reset (e.g., when buying new), the IMEI can still be found. A screenshot showing how to find it in this state can simplify the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

#### [[understanding_dual_sim_email_numbers_in_iphones | Understanding Dual SIM IMEI Numbers]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>

Some iPhones support dual SIM functionality, meaning they can have two IMEI numbers, one associated with each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If your device has two IMEI numbers, it is crucial to check **both** of them to ensure a comprehensive verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Verifying the iPhone's Status Online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

Once you have the IMEI number(s), proceed to the online verification tool:

1.  **Access the Web Page:** Go to the specified web page on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
2.  **Enter the IMEI:** Copy and paste the IMEI number into the designated field on the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Complete CAPTCHA:** Confirm that you are not a robot by completing the CAPTCHA challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  **Check Status:** The tool will then display whether the IMEI is reported (stolen, lost, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

The results will indicate if the device is activated, if "Find My iPhone" is enabled, and most importantly, if it is reported as stolen or on a "blacklist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. For devices with [[understanding_dual_sim_email_numbers_in_iphones | dual SIMs]], repeat this process for each IMEI number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The tool may also display the iPhone model during the check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

## Sending Cryptocurrency to an Exchange

The first step involves opening the cryptocurrency application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. It's crucial to identify which cryptocurrency will be withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

*   If the cryptocurrency is BNB (Binance Coin), the only platform that accepts Byconchain BNB is [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   For other cryptocurrencies like Serium or Bitcoin, they can be sent to any conventional exchange such as [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | Binance]], Q Coin, Coin Bays, or Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The chosen exchange must allow withdrawals to a [[options_for_bank_transfer_from_binance | bank account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

To send the cryptocurrency:
1.  Select the cryptocurrency (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

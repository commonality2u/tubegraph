### Depositing Fiat Currency
Fiat currencies are national currencies such as Euro, Dollar, or Pound Sterling, which are accepted by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The available methods and associated fees can vary depending on the currency chosen and the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Available methods might include:
*   **Visa/MC Bank Card**: For Euro, this has been observed with a 1.8% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. For Pound Sterling, only the bank card method appeared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

*   **SEPA Transfer / Faster Payments**: These methods can sometimes be suspended due to measures taken by certain countries within the European community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Commissions for card deposits, such as 1.8% for Euro or Pound Sterling, are generally considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Depositing Cryptocurrencies
You can also deposit cryptocurrencies directly into [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. The cost of these deposits depends on the blockchain network used, which can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It is advisable to choose cryptocurrencies with lower transaction costs for sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Alternative Strategy: Using Other Platforms to Reduce Fees
If direct fiat deposit commissions on [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] are too high, an alternative is to deposit fiat money into another cryptocurrency exchange, convert it to a low-fee cryptocurrency, and then transfer that cryptocurrency to [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### Using Kraken as an intermediary
Kraken is an example of a platform where you might find enabled SEPA or SWIFT transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
1.  **Deposit Fiat**: You can deposit euros into Kraken via SEPA or SWIFT transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For example, a 2,000 Euro deposit can be made, typically arriving within one or two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. These fiat deposits often have no direct cost on Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
2.  **Convert Fiat to Crypto**: Once fiat is deposited, convert it into a cryptocurrency with low transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Converting euros to cryptocurrency on Kraken might incur a commission of around 0.16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For a 2,000 Euro deposit, this conversion would cost approximately 3.2 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
3.  **Transfer Crypto to Binance**: Choose a cryptocurrency known for low withdrawal fees.
    *   **Litecoin (LTC)**: An example with low shipping costs, noted at 0.02 LTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   **Tron (TRX)**: Another cryptocurrency with very low fees. Sending Tron (TRX) from Kraken to [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] might cost around 10 cents (USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   The total cost of this method (deposit fiat, convert, transfer crypto) for a 2,000 Euro example, using Tron, would be approximately 3.3 Euros (3.2 Euros for conversion + 0.1 Euro for transfer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

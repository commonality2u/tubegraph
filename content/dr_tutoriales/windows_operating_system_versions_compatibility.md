This article describes how to manage keyboard locking features, specifically the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] function, across different Windows operating system versions.

## Keyboard Blocking and Unlocking

A method exists to block and unlock the computer's keyboard on various Windows operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This functionality allows users to unlock the keyboard if it has been accidentally locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

### Compatibility
This tutorial is compatible with:
*   Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Windows 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>
*   Windows 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>

### Activating Filter Keys (Blocking the Keyboard)
The keyboard can be blocked using a feature referred to as [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Windows filters]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These filters are designed to block the keyboard on Windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To activate the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] and block the keyboard:
1.  Verify the keyboard is currently functional (e.g., by typing in a text editor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  Press and hold the Shift key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, located underneath the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  Continue holding the Shift key for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
4.  After eight seconds, the computer will emit a sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
5.  A screen will appear, prompting the user to "turn on the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter keys]] of Windows Ten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
6.  The "Yes" option will be selected by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, and users may unintentionally confirm it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
7.  Selecting "Yes" will block the keyboard, preventing it from functioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Deactivating Filter Keys (Unlocking the Keyboard)
To deactivate the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] and unlock the keyboard:
1.  Press and hold the Shift key again for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  The computer will sound again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
3.  The keyboard will reactivate, allowing the user to type freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

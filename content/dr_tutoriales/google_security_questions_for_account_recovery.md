Google provides various methods to [[recovering_gmail_password | recover a forgotten password]] or [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | regain access to an email account]], and one of the ultimate options involves answering security questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>

## When Security Questions are Used

This method serves as a last resort when other [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | account recovery methods]] are not available or have failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>. This includes situations where:
*   The user cannot remember a [[recovering_gmail_password | previously used password]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   There is no [[alternative_recovery_options_like_phone_number_or_secondary_email | associated recovery email]] or phone number set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   The user doesn't have access to a device from which the account was previously accessed, which might allow [[using_browser_settings_for_email_recovery | recovery via browser settings]] such as [[Google Chrome privacy and security settings | saved passwords]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.
*   There is no other email account from a friend or family member that can be used for contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

## How it Works

In this final scenario, Google explicitly states that to recover the account and password, the user will need to "answer a series of questions related to our account or personal questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. These are questions that were presumably filled in by the user at the time of account creation or later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. It is expected that the user should remember the answers to these questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

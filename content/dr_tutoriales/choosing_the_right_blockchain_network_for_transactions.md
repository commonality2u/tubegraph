When transferring cryptocurrency between platforms, selecting the correct blockchain network is a crucial step to ensure the transaction is successful and to avoid potential loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This process is relevant whether sending cryptocurrencies like BNB, Ethereum, or Bitcoin to various conventional exchanges such as [[using_kraken_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | Kraken]], [[using_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_for_transactions | Coinbase]], KuCoin, or Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Steps for Selecting a Network and Transferring Funds

1.  **Open the Application**: Begin by opening your cryptocurrency application on your mobile device, whether it's an iPhone or Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  **Identify Cryptocurrency for Withdrawal**: Be clear about which cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. For example, if you have BNB, the Binance platform accepts BNB via its "Byconchain" (likely referring to Binance Chain or BNB Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Send/Withdrawal**:
    *   From your source platform (e.g., Trust Wallet), select the "Send" option for your chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   On the receiving exchange (e.g., Binance), navigate to the "Deposit" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
4.  **Choose the Blockchain Network**: This is a critical step.
    *   After selecting the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, you will be prompted to choose the blockchain network you will use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   It is essential to select the *exact same network* on both the sending and receiving platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For instance, if sending BNB, ensure both platforms use the "baconchain" (Binance Chain/BNB Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
5.  **Copy Wallet Address and Memo/Tag**:
    *   Copy the unique wallet address provided by the receiving exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   If applicable, also copy the memo or tag associated with the deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
6.  **Paste Information into Sending Platform**: Paste the copied wallet address and memo/tag into the corresponding fields on your sending platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
7.  **Review and Confirm Transaction**: Before confirming, review the transaction details, including the network selected and any associated fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. A small commission, such as two cents on the dollar, may apply for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Post-Transfer Steps on the Exchange

Once the capital arrives at the exchange's spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>:

1.  **Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat**:
    *   Go to the "Trade" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Select "Convert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Choose the cryptocurrency you deposited (e.g., BNB) and convert it to your desired fiat currency, such as EUR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  **Withdraw Fiat to Bank Account**:
    *   After the conversion, go to the "Spot" section where the fiat currency will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   Select "Withdraw" and then choose "Fiat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
    *   Choose the fiat currency (e.g., EUR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   Select the withdrawal amount and method, such as SEPA bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> or a Visa bank card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
    *   Alternative methods for no-commission deposits may also be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

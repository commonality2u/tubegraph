This guide outlines how to customize notification preferences, specifically focusing on managing [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods notification control]] on an iPhone.

## Accessing Notification Settings on iPhone

To begin customizing notification preferences, navigate to your iPhone's settings:
1.  Go to the "Settings" app on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Ensure your device is connected to your AirPods (e.g., "Rafael's AirPods Pro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
3.  Within the settings, locate and tap on "Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If "Notifications" is not immediately visible, use the search bar at the top to type "notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The notification settings section also displays general options for how notifications are shown, such as in a group, list, or count, primarily for app notifications like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Managing AirPods Notification Announcements

To control whether notifications are read aloud through your AirPods:
1.  Inside the "Notifications" section, find and select "[[managing_app_notifications_with_siri | Siri, Announce Notifications]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Here, you will see an option to either activate or [[deactivating_airpods_notifications | deactivate notifications]] announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
3.  To stop notifications from being read aloud when your headphones are on, simply deactivate the "Announce notifications" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If activated, you will be able to respond without confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
4.  Additionally, you can specify which applications [[managing_app_notifications_with_siri | Siri]] should announce notifications for when using headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, if you have notification announcements activated for headphones but wish for a specific app like "Fever" to stop announcing notifications, you can disable it from the list of applications below <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
    *   By managing these settings, notifications from various applications will either be announced or silenced through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

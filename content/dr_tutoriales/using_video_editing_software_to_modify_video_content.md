To upload fragments of series, films, or [[techniques_for_uploading_edited_anime_content_successfully | anime]] to YouTube without encountering copyright bans, specific [[editing_audio_and_video_to_bypass_copyright_detection | editing audio and video]] techniques can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. YouTube often blocks or bans videos due to detected copied audio (music, voices) or images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While some videos might be monetized, they can still be blocked or banned from public view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Software Used

A common program for these modifications is [[Filmora 10 video editing tips | Filmora 9]] (also referred to as "Filmora") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Editing Techniques for Copyright Bypass

The goal of [[editing_audio_and_video_to_bypass_copyright_detection | editing audio and video]] is to modify both the visual and auditory elements enough so that YouTube's copyright detection systems do not flag the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Visual Modifications

To prevent YouTube from tracking copyright through images, the following visual alterations can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>:

*   **Add a Channel Logo**: Incorporate a custom channel logo that remains visible throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This logo should be placed on the screen for the duration of the content, modifying the original image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Apply Effects**: Utilize built-in effects from the [[Filmora 10 video editing tips | video editing software]], such as a "light leak" effect, to alter the visual presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Add a Border**: Apply a blurred border around the video frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For example, a blue border at the bottom and white at the top can create a blurred effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. The border's color and position can be customized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Maintain Full Screen with Edits**: The technique involves keeping the video on the screen at full size while overlaying a border and a logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Audio Modifications

Modifying the audio is crucial to bypass copyright detection related to sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>:

*   **Adjust Original Volume**: When a video is imported into [[Filmora 10 video editing tips | Filmora 9]], it retains its default sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To avoid copyright issues, reduce the original video's volume slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Prevent Audio Peak Detection**: Lowering the volume prevents YouTube from detecting the original audio peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The sound will still be audible, allowing viewers to adjust the volume on YouTube if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Uploading to YouTube

After the video has been [[editing_audio_and_video_to_bypass_copyright_detection | edited]] with modified sound, the logo, and the frame, it is ready for upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The process involves selecting the "upload videos" option within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, choosing the edited video file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, and proceeding through the standard upload steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If the editing was successful, the video should process and upload without restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

This guide explains how to manage and deactivate notifications that are announced via your AirPods from your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing Notification Settings

To begin, you need to access the [[iphone_settings_for_airpods | Settings]] on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Ensure your AirPods are connected, as the settings will recognize them (e.g., "Rafael's AirPods Pro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

1.  Open the **Settings** app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the **Notifications** section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If you don't immediately see it, use the search bar at the top by typing "notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
3.  Tap on **Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Controlling Siri Announce Notifications

Within the Notifications settings, you'll find options related to Siri's announcement of notifications through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

1.  Locate and tap on **Siri, Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
2.  Here, you'll see a toggle to **Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   If activated, Siri will announce notifications, especially when headphones are on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   To [[deactivating_airpods_notifications | deactivate]] notifications from being read aloud by Siri, simply toggle this option off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
    *   To re-enable the feature, toggle it back on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  You may also see an option to **Respond Without Confirmation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## App-Specific Notification Management

You can further refine which apps notify you via Siri when your headphones are connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

1.  Below the main "Announce Notifications" toggle, you can choose specific applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
2.  If the global "Announce Notifications" is active, you can still prevent individual apps from announcing notifications through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  For example, if you want to stop a specific app like "Fever" from announcing notifications, you can toggle its individual setting to off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This way, even if general announcements are on, that particular app's notifications won't be read aloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

By following these steps, you can effectively manage and [[customizing_notification_preferences | customize]] how notifications are delivered through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

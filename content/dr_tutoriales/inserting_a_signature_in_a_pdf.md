A video tutorial demonstrates how to [[inserting_signatures_and_other_elements_in_pdfs | insert a signature]] within a PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This process is presented as super easy, simple, and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Preparation

To begin, you'll need the PDF file you wish to sign and a signature image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The tutorial uses a signature downloaded from the internet for privacy reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The goal is to [[inserting_signatures_and_other_elements_in_pdfs | insert]] this signature into a cover letter PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Steps to Insert a Signature

1.  **Open the PDF**: Open the PDF file you want to sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
2.  **Access Fill & Sign**: Once the PDF is open, navigate to the "Fill out and sign" option, which appears on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This option allows you to [[filling_and_signing_pdf_documents | fill out]], sign, and send, or obtain the signature of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Click "Fill out and sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
3.  **Navigate to Signing Area**: Scroll to the desired location within the document where you want to place the signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
4.  **Add the Signature**:
    *   Go to the "Sign" option at the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   Click "Add a signature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   You have several options for creating a signature:
        *   **Type**: You can type text, such as "subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, and choose from millions of available styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
        *   **Draw**: You can [[adding_and_editing_text_and_images_in_pdfs | draw]] your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
        *   **Image**: You can select a signature you have in image format (e.g., from your desktop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. If it's your own signature, you can scan it or take a photo and transfer it to your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The tutorial uses a downloaded image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   Once the signature is placed, you can move it around, and make it larger or smaller as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Saving the Signed PDF

After placing the signature, the document is considered signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
1.  Go to "File" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Select "Save As" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
3.  Give the file a new name (e.g., "file name signed Harriet") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The process creates a new PDF file with the signature embedded, allowing you to have both the original unsigned version and the new [[Saving signed PDF files | signed PDF]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

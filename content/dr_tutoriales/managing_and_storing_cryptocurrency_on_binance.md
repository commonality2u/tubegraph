This article outlines how to buy and manage cryptocurrencies, specifically focusing on "U.S. of U." (USDT), within the [[Binance|Binance]] platform.

## Buying USDT on Binance (Desktop)

To buy USDT on [[Binance|Binance]] using the desktop interface:
1.  Navigate to the "Markets" section, then select "Zones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>.
2.  All available cryptocurrencies in the market can be found here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">00:01:16</a>.
3.  Use the magnifying glass icon at the top to search for "U.S. of U." (USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">00:01:21</a>.
4.  USDT is a cryptocurrency that tracks the behavior of the U.S. dollar, serving as a reliable digital representation of its value within the crypto world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">00:01:33</a>.
5.  To determine the exchange pair, first select USDT, then use the magnifying glass to search for the specific cryptocurrency or fiat currency you wish to trade with (e.g., Bitcoin, Euros, or DAI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">00:02:00</a>.

### Understanding Trading Pairs

The order of currencies in a trading pair is critical:
*   If the pair is listed as `USDT/DAI`, and you choose to "buy," you are buying USDT (the first asset listed in the pair) using DAI (the second asset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">00:02:56</a>.
*   If the pair is `DAI/USDT`, and you choose to "buy," you are buying DAI (the first asset) using USDT (the second asset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">00:03:00</a>.
*   Conversely, if you "sell," you are selling the first asset in the pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">00:03:17</a>. For example, if you have DAI and want to acquire USDT from a `USDT/DAI` pair, you would "sell" your DAI to obtain USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">00:03:08</a>.

This understanding is crucial for ensuring you are performing the intended transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">00:03:24</a>.

### Placing a Market Order

For immediate execution, it is recommended to use a market order:
1.  After selecting your desired trading pair (e.g., `USDT/DAI`), go to the "Buy" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">00:03:40</a>.
2.  Choose "Market Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">00:03:44</a>. A market order executes at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">00:03:46</a>.
3.  Enter the desired quantity of USDT you wish to buy, or the total amount of the other currency you want to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">00:04:22</a>.
4.  Click "Buy" to execute the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">00:04:32</a>.

### Other Order Types
While market orders are good for immediate execution, [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Limit orders and Stop-limit orders]] are used for buying at a fixed, predetermined price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">00:03:57</a>. These orders automatically execute when the price reaches your chosen level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">00:04:02</a>.

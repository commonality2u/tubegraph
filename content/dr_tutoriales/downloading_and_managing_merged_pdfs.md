After successfully merging PDF files, the next step involves downloading and managing the newly created document. This process is straightforward, especially when using online tools like [[using_i_love_pdf_for_merging_pdfs | I Love PDF]].

## Downloading the Merged PDF

Once PDFs have been selected and the "Merge PDF" or "Join PDF" button is clicked, the merged PDF becomes available for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. The merged content will be contained within a single PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.

## Locating and Renaming the Merged PDF

By default, the downloaded merged PDF will typically be found in your computer's "Downloads" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The file will often have a descriptive name reflecting the original documents and the merging action, for example, "Multicinema Safari Merge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Users have the flexibility to rename the downloaded PDF file at any time to better suit their organization needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. Upon opening the merged file, all the combined original documents, such as two invoices, will be present together within the single PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Post-Merging Management

*   **Review Content**: Always open the merged PDF to confirm that all original documents are present and correctly ordered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **File Size**: If the merged PDF results in a very large file, consider [[compressing_pdfs_after_merging | compressing it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Tutorials are available for [[compressing_pdfs_after_merging | compressing PDFs easily]] on both phones and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **No External Program Needed**: The merging process itself, including the download, does not require an external program to be installed on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Google Chrome is sufficient for the web-based process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

## Transferring Cryptocurrencies from Coinbase to Binance

The core process involves sending from Coinbase (the sender) and depositing to Binance (the receiver) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

### Obtaining the Binance Deposit Address (Computer)

To receive cryptocurrencies in Binance, you need to obtain your specific wallet address for the desired cryptocurrency:
1.  Access your Binance account and navigate to the "Wallet" section, then "Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  Click on "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Select "Deposit Crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Fiat currency (local currency) is not what you want to deposit for crypto transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
4.  Choose the specific cryptocurrency you intend to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
5.  A unique deposit code (wallet address) and a [[using_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transfer | QR code]] will be generated. This code changes based on the cryptocurrency selected, emphasizing the importance of [[choosing_appropriate_networks_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | choosing the correct one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Sending from Coinbase (Mobile)

If you are using the Coinbase mobile application to send cryptocurrencies:
1.  Access the Coinbase application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  Go to the specific cryptocurrency wallet you wish to transfer (e.g., Bitcoin wallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  Locate the [[using_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transfer | QR code]] symbol, typically in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
4.  Grant camera access and scan the [[using_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transfer | QR code]] displayed on your computer screen from the Binance deposit page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  Enter the amount of cryptocurrency you wish to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
6.  Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Sending from Coinbase (Computer)

To send cryptocurrencies from Coinbase using a computer:
1.  From the Binance deposit page, copy the alphanumeric wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
2.  In Coinbase, navigate to the "Send and Receive" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
3.  Choose the amount of Bitcoin you want to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
4.  Paste the copied Binance wallet address into the recipient field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
5.  Add a note for the transaction, if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
6.  Review the transaction details, including the [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commission fee]] charged by Coinbase (e.g., less than one euro for a ~â‚¬110 transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
7.  Click "Send now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
8.  Enter a verification code received on your mobile phone to confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## Confirming the Transaction

After initiating the transfer, the balance in your Coinbase wallet will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The transaction typically takes around 10 minutes to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Once the transfer is complete, you will receive a confirmation message on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. You can also verify the deposit in your Binance transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Your Binance fiat and spot balance will reflect the newly deposited funds, which can then be used within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

To configure your computer for DNIe (electronic ID card) use, you will need a specific PIN key and specialized software, in addition to an ID card reader. This setup allows you to authenticate and sign documents digitally using your DNIe.

## Obtaining the DNIe Code

Before starting the computer configuration, you need a PIN key or code for your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This code is typically issued on the day you obtain your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

If you do not have this code, you can obtain it by visiting the nearest police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Automated machines are available at police stations where you can log in with your ID card to retrieve the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This process involves signing up on the machine to receive your code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For more detailed steps on this, refer to the guide on [[steps_to_obtain_a_dnie_code | steps to obtain a DNIe code]].

## Downloading Required Software

The configuration requires two main software packages, accessible via links typically provided in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:

1.  **Software from the government headquarters**: This is essential for [[installing_necessary_software_for_dnie | DNIe functionality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  **Electronic signature software**: This enables the installation of digital signature capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Checking Your Computer's System Architecture

It is crucial to download the correct version (32-bit or 64-bit) of the software based on your computer's operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. To check your system architecture:
1.  Open File Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "This PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  Look for "System type" to see if it's a "64-bit Operating System" or 32-bit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

After determining your system type, download the appropriate versions of both the government headquarters software and the electronic signature software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Installing the FNMT Configurator

The first software to install is the FNMT (FÃ¡brica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre) configurator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
1.  Locate the downloaded configurator file and run it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  Follow the on-screen prompts, clicking "Next" and accepting the conditions to proceed with the installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
3.  The installer will specify the directory where the software will be installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
4.  Once the installation is complete, click "Finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Installing Self-Signature Software

Next, install the self-signature software that was downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
1.  Double-click the self-signature installer file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
2.  Similar to the previous installation, click "Yes" and "Next," then accept the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
3.  During installation, you might see an option to set up Firefox for relying on the root certificate. If you use Firefox, ensure this option is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
4.  Proceed with the installation and click "Finish" once complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This installs the self-signature software on your computer, which will be visible as an application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Using an ID Card Reader

To validate your DNIe certificate, you will need an [[using_an_id_card_reader_with_electronic_dnie | ID card reader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These devices are widely available, for example, on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

1.  Insert your DNIe into the reader, ensuring the chip is properly aligned to be read by the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
2.  Connect the ID card reader to your computer via a USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
3.  Your computer should recognize the device, indicating it's ready to read the DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Validating the Digital Certificate

To verify that your DNIe is working correctly and its certificates are recognized, you can use a validation link provided by the FNMT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

1.  Access the FNMT validation page (link typically in the video's first comment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
2.  Look for the "Validate certificate" option on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
3.  Click "Select Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
4.  This will prompt you to open the self-signature application that you previously installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
5.  The self-signature application will read the electronic certificates stored on your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
6.  You will see various certificates associated with your name, including authentication and signature certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
7.  Choose an appropriate certificate (e.g., the DNIe electronic signature) and enter your secret code (PIN key) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
8.  The system will then confirm that the certificate is valid, displaying your name, surname, and DNIe information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

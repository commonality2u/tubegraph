## Method 1: Using Google Chrome's Print Function

### Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Open the PDF with Google Chrome:**
    *   Locate the PDF file on your computer [00:00:17].
    *   Instead of opening it with Adobe Acrobat, right-click the PDF, select "Open with," and choose [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] [00:00:28].
    *   The PDF will open in a new tab within [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]], displaying its different pages [00:00:36]. This uses a local directory on your computer [00:00:42].

2.  **Access the Print Dialogue:**
    *   Once the PDF is open in [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]], locate and click the "Printer button" (print icon) at the top [00:00:45].

3.  **Select Custom Pages:**
    *   In the print dialogue box that appears, find the "Pages" option [00:00:52].
    *   Change the setting from "All" to "Custom" [00:00:55].

4.  **Specify Desired Pages:**
    *   In the "Custom" field, enter the specific page numbers you wish to extract [00:00:58].
    *   For example, if you want only pages three and four from a PDF with about eight pages, you would put "three, four" [00:01:00].
    *   In this instance, only pages three and four will be downloaded [00:01:09].

5.  **"Print" to Save as PDF:**
    *   Click the "print" button [00:01:13]. This action will prompt you to save the selected pages as a new PDF document.

6.  **Choose Save Location and Name:**
    *   Select the desired location on your computer to store the new PDF [00:01:15].
    *   Provide a new name for the file, such as "cropped PDF" [00:01:22].
    *   Click "save" [00:01:27].

### Verification

After saving, you can open the newly created PDF. As demonstrated, it will show only the selected pages, such as page three and page four [00:01:34].

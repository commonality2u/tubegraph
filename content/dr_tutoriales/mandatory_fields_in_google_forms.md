[[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | Google Forms]] allows users to create forms and surveys, including the option to designate certain questions as mandatory. This ensures that respondents provide necessary information before submitting the form.

## Setting a Field as Mandatory
When [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | creating a form]] or adding a question, you can easily mark it as mandatory. For example, after adding a "Name" field, you can set it as mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:05">[01:23:05]</a>. Similarly, an "Email" field can be made mandatory to ensure email addresses are collected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>. Even longer response fields, such as "Explain your doubts" (using a paragraph question type), can be set as mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.

## Implications of Mandatory Fields
A key implication of a mandatory field is that the form cannot be submitted unless that field is filled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. For instance, if a file upload field is marked as mandatory, the form will prevent submission if no file is uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. This feature is particularly useful for encouraging interaction, such as ensuring a user confirms subscription before completing a form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Visual Indicator
In the form preview, mandatory questions are indicated by an asterisk (*), signaling to the respondent that these fields require a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:05">[07:35:05]</a>.

## Customization and Flexibility
While it's possible to make various fields mandatory, the decision to do so depends on the specific purpose of your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. For example, a "Phone" field might be considered too invasive for simple queries and thus not made mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. Likewise, certain fields, like "What tutorial you've seen," might not be mandatory to allow for optional input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

## Other Settings
When [[sharing_and_customization_options_in_google_forms | managing survey responses in Google Forms]], you can also configure settings such as whether to collect email addresses automatically or limit responses to one per user, though limiting responses might not always be desired if a user might have multiple interactions over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. You can also customize the confirmation message displayed after a response is sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

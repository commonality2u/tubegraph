PayPal allows users to link a credit or debit card to their account for various transactions. While it is possible to [[creating_a_paypal_account_without_a_credit_card|create a PayPal account without a credit card]] or debit card initially, and only [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments|receive payments within PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, linking a card enables more functionalities like buying online or sending money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## When the Option to Link a Card Appears

After [[creating_a_paypal_account_without_a_credit_card|setting up a PayPal account]] and confirming the email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, PayPal presents the option to link a credit or debit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Initially, a notification might appear prompting the user to "link a card to use later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> or to "finish setting up your account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

## How to Link a Credit or Debit Card

If you have already created a PayPal account without immediately linking a card and wish to do so later, follow these steps:
1.  Log in to your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
2.  On the main account page, locate the section that says "Keep your financial information secure when purchasing on the internet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
3.  Click on this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
4.  You will then be able to enter your credit or debit card details directly on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

Linking a card allows for secure financial transactions online without sharing payment information directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

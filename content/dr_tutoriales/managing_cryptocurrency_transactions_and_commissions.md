This article details the process of managing cryptocurrency transactions, specifically focusing on withdrawing capital from platforms like KuCoin to a traditional bank account, and highlights considerations regarding commissions and suitable payment methods.

## Withdrawing Capital from KuCoin

To withdraw capital from the KuCoin platform to a bank account, it's essential to understand the platform's limitations and available strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Initial Setup and Discounts

When creating an account on KuCoin, utilizing a referral link can provide a 10% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, and deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This can help in [[reducing_binance_commissions | reducing commissions]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Understanding KuCoin's Withdrawal Limitations

KuCoin allows deposits of both cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies (national currencies like Euro, Dollar, Pound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, it only permits the withdrawal of registered cryptocurrencies, not national (fiat) currencies directly to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This is because an intermediary company facilitates fiat deposits to KuCoin but does not perform the same function for withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Solution for Fiat Withdrawal

To withdraw capital in fiat currency to a bank account from KuCoin, the recommended process is to transfer cryptocurrencies from KuCoin to another exchange platform that supports direct fiat withdrawals to bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Platforms like Coinbase and Kraken are examples that facilitate such bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Transfer Considerations

When transferring cryptocurrencies between platforms:

*   **Choose a low-fee cryptocurrency:** Select a cryptocurrency whose blockchain transfer fees are relatively inexpensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Network selection:** The choice of network (e.g., ERC-20 vs. TRC-20) significantly impacts [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_commissions | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For instance, an ERC-20 transfer for USDT could incur high fees, such as $20-$25, which is considered excessive for smaller amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. A TRC-20 transfer for USDT, however, might only cost 1 USDT, making it a much cheaper option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Transfer and Withdrawal (KuCoin to Kraken)

1.  **Initiate Withdrawal on KuCoin:** Go to the 'assets' section on KuCoin and select 'withdraw' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Select Cryptocurrency:** Choose the cryptocurrency to withdraw, such as USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
3.  **Obtain Recipient Wallet Address:** On the receiving platform (e.g., Kraken), navigate to the deposit section for the chosen cryptocurrency (USDT) and generate a deposit address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Ensure the selected network matches the sending platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.
4.  **Paste Address and Enter Amount:** Paste the copied deposit address into KuCoin's withdrawal form, specify the amount, and confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Withdrawal:** Enter the trade code for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The transaction status can be viewed in the withdrawal history on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
6.  **Convert to Fiat on Receiving Platform:** Once the cryptocurrency arrives on the receiving platform (e.g., Kraken), convert it to your desired fiat currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Kraken charges a relatively normal commission for this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. For larger amounts where saving on [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] is crucial, Kraken Pro may offer lower [[exchange_platform_fees_and_commissions | transaction fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
7.  **Withdraw to Bank Account:** After conversion, withdraw the fiat currency to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Options include wire transfer or direct bank account transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Compatible Bank Accounts

Traditional banks (e.g., Santander, BBVA) often block transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. To avoid issues, it's recommended to use neo-banks like N26 or Revolut, which are generally free to open and readily accept transactions from crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

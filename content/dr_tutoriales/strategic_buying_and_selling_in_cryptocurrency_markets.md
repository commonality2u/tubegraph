The [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | KuCoin]] platform offers various order types to facilitate strategic purchases and sales within the [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | cryptocurrency trading options and strategies]] market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These orders simplify [[managing_cryptocurrency_to_maximize_profits | managing cryptocurrency to maximize profits]] by allowing users to execute transactions under different market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

To access these order types on the [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | KuCoin]] computer platform, navigate to the "commercial" or "spot valet market" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The interface also displays the order book and recent open orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Order Types

The primary order types available on KuCoin for strategic trading include Market, Limit, Stop Limit, and Stop Market orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Market Order

A market order is executed in real-time, allowing users to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at its current market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The transaction occurs instantly at the exact price the crypto asset holds when the order is clicked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For example, if KCS is priced at 10.687 USDT, a market order will buy or sell at that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Limit Order

A limit order enables users to set a specific price and quantity for a buy or sell transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The order is placed and will only execute when the market price reaches the predetermined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

#### Strategic Applications:

*   **Buying**: If a user anticipates a price drop, they can place a buy limit order at a lower target price (e.g., 9.984). The order will only execute if the price falls to this level, with the expectation that the price will then rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Selling**: Conversely, if a user expects the price to rise to a certain resistance level (e.g., 11.187), they can place a sell limit order at that price. This order executes when the asset reaches that value, anticipating a subsequent price decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Users can view and cancel open limit orders in the "open orders" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Stop Limit Order

The stop limit order introduces two prices: a "limit price" and a "stop price," along with the quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

*   **Limit Price**: This is the price at which the order begins to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Stop Price**: This is the price at which the order is fully executed (100%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

The order executes progressively between the limit price and the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For example, if a buy limit is set at 9.96 and a stop price at 10.368, percentages of the order execute as the price moves from 9.96 towards 10.368, with full execution at the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. If the price does not reach the stop price, only a partial percentage of the order may be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This order type is crucial for [[leverage_trading_in_cryptocurrency | reducing risk]] by ensuring that if the market does not follow the desired pattern, the entire investment is not lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Stop Market Order

The stop market order operates on a similar principle to the stop limit order but executes at market price once the stop price is triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

*   **Stop Price**: This is the trigger price that activates a market order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
*   **Execution**: Once the stop price is reached, a market order is placed, executing at the current market value (e.g., 10.698 or 10.700) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

This order type allows users to set a trigger point for a market buy or sell. For instance, setting a stop price for a sell order at 10.354 would initiate a market sell when that price is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Like stop limit orders, if the market does not fully reach the stop price, only a percentage of the order may be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Users can cancel open stop market orders at any point, even if partially executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

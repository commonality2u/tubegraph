Near Field Communication (NFC) is a technology enabling communication between two devices when they are brought into close proximity. It is particularly useful for various mobile applications, including managing digital certificates and electronic ID cards.

## NFC Activation and Functionality
On Android devices, users typically need to activate the NFC antenna manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. In contrast, on iPhones, the NFC antenna is already activated by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This antenna allows for functionalities like making payments in establishments using the mobile phone, provided the user has their card stored in a digital wallet like Apple Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Using NFC for Electronic ID and Digital Certificates
NFC is integral for interacting with an [[how_to_activate_an_electronic_id | electronic ID card]] (DNIe) and its associated [[managing_digital_certificates_on_mobile_devices | digital certificates]] directly from a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This process allows the mobile phone to read the chip embedded within the physical ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

### Process for Reading an Electronic ID
To read the chip of an [[how_to_activate_an_electronic_id | electronic ID card]] using NFC:
1.  **Prepare the Device**: Ensure the mobile phone is without a case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
2.  **Position the ID**: Place the [[how_to_activate_an_electronic_id | electronic ID card]] on a smooth surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Scan**: Position the mobile phone near the top of the ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The NFC antenna is typically located at the top of the mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
4.  **Detect Chip**: Keep the phone in place until it detects the chip on the ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This method allows for the secure reading of information, such as the CAM code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a> and the PIN associated with the [[how_to_activate_an_electronic_id | DNI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, from the physical ID card to install [[managing_digital_certificates_on_mobile_devices | digital certificates]] on the mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before uploading, you must have an existing YouTube account associated with Gmail and a channel created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Accessing YouTube Studio

1.  Access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

3.  Within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], locate the "upload videos" icon, which looks like an arrow pointing up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Alternatively, you can click "Create" to find the same upload option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
    *   Note: You can also choose to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | broadcast live]] from this menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Uploading the Video File

After clicking the upload option, you will need to select a file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. There are two primary methods for this:

*   **Drag and Drop:** Drag the video file directly to the YouTube platform's upload area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Select File:** Click "Select file" and choose the source file from your computer's directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Once selected, the video will begin uploading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Content Editing Process

After the video starts uploading, you will move to the content editing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This includes:

*   Adding the title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   Writing the description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Once these details are set, click "Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Video Processing and Visibility

After uploading, YouTube processes the video to check for copyright rules violations or other requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. YouTube has censorship rules and content guidelines that videos must adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Checking Restrictions

To ensure your video can be viewed, confirm that its visibility is public and that there are no copyright or other restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. If you wish to change visibility, you can choose between public, private, or hidden options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Duplicate Video Warning

You cannot upload the same video file twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If you attempt to upload a duplicate, the processing will be interrupted, and you will be informed that the file is a duplicate of a video already uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

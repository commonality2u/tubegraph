## Important Considerations

### Video Processing and Visibility

After uploading, [[youtube_platform | YouTube]] processes the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:09">[03:03:09]</a>. During processing, [[youtube_platform | YouTube]] checks for copyright rules violations and ensures all requirements are met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:04">[03:08:04]</a>.

For people to watch your videos, the visibility must be set to "public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:09">[03:38:09]</a>. Visibility can also be set to "private" or "hidden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:15">[03:49:15]</a>.

### Copyright and Restrictions

[[youtube_platform | YouTube]] has censorship rules, and certain content may not be appropriate for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. It is crucial that the video has no copyright or other restrictions for public viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:56">[03:29:56]</a>.

### Duplicate Files

It is not possible to upload the same video twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:28">[04:21:28]</a>. If a duplicate file is detected, the processing will be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:09">[04:17:09]</a>.

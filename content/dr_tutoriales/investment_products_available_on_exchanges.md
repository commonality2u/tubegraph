The comparison focuses on commissions, facilities, and associated expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Platform Comparison Methodology

An Excel sheet was used to compare three platforms: Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The comparison covers several sections:
*   Account section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   Deposit section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Trading section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Staking/Investment section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Withdrawal section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>

### Account Fees

Having an account on Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, or Binance is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This category results in a tie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Deposit Fees

When considering deposits:
*   **Coinbase**: Charges a commission ranging from 1% to 4% depending on the transfer method and region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. For instance, a transfer from Chile incurs a 3.99% fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: A SEPA transfer costs 0.15 euros, showing a significant difference from Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Binance**:
    *   Fiat deposits are available through various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Visa/Mastercard deposits incur an 1.8% charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   SEPA transfers have 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   iDEAL transfers cost 1.3 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

    *   It is generally recommended to make fiat deposits via bank transfers to avoid high card commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] is considered the winner in deposit fees because it allows deposits with zero commission through methods like SEPA or Swift transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Using a referral link for a Binance account can also save up to 10% on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Trading Fees

For [[cryptocurrency_trading_options_and_strategies | cryptocurrency trading options and strategies]]:

    *   Paying commissions with BNB, especially from [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | flexible savings and investment options in Binance]] or spot wallets, reduces fees by 25% (e.g., from 0.1% to 0.075%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   The platform differentiates between "maker" (limit orders) and "taker" (market orders) fees, with maker fees typically being lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

### Investment Products (Staking)

[[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] offers a wide array of investment products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>:
*   **Flexible products**: Allow withdrawals at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

Binance's offerings enable users to achieve high returns, with examples such as 37.49% for staking CAKE for 15 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. The speaker considers Binance's investment products to be a significant advantage over Coinbase and Coinbase Pro, which are seen as much worse and more limited in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

    *   Swift transfers are cheaper than Binance (25 dollars less) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Coinbase Pro generally wins in terms of direct withdrawal commissions for specific fiat transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

Google Forms offers various features for [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | creating a form]] and then customizing its appearance and sharing it with respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Customization Options

Once a form is created, users can [[how_to_customize_surveys_in_google_forms | customize]] its look and feel:
*   **Theme and Aesthetics** You can change the theme, header, and fonts (letters) of your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Emojis can also be added to questions and descriptions to make the form more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Preview Mode** A preview option allows you to see how the form will appear to respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This preview also clearly indicates mandatory questions, usually marked with an asterisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Sharing Options

After [[creating_a_survey_using_google_forms | designing your form]], Google Forms provides several methods for distribution:
*   **Email** Forms can be sent directly via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. However, it's important to note that if anonymity is desired for a survey, sending it by email is not recommended, as your email address will appear as the sender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Shareable Link** A direct link to the form can be generated and shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This URL can be shortened for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Once copied, this link allows anyone with access to open the form in a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. For anonymous surveys, using the shareable link is the recommended approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **HTML Embed** Google Forms also offers an HTML code for embedding the form directly into a web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   **Limitation**: If the form includes a file upload option, the HTML embed code may not be generated. To obtain the HTML code, the file upload question must be removed from the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

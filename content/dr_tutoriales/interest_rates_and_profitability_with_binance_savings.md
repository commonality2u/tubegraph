Binance offers "Savings" products that allow users to generate profitability from their held cryptocurrencies, whether they are new or existing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. These savings options, both [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible]] and [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked]], enable users to make important decisions based on the profitability they offer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

To access these features, navigate to the "Finance" section within the Exchange and select "Savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This section compiles various programs designed to help users earn returns on their cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Types of Savings: Flexible vs. Blocked

Binance primarily offers two types of savings options:
*   **Flexible Terms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   **Fixed Terms (Blocked Savings)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

### [[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible Savings]]

With [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]], users can deposit their cryptocurrency at any time and withdraw it whenever they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The interest rate for [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] is generally more or less fixed, though it can vary and is not a constant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The returns are typically lower compared to [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### [[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked Savings]]

[[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked savings]] involve depositing a cryptocurrency for a specific number of days, such as 7, 14, 30, or 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. As the name suggests, the funds are blocked for the chosen duration and cannot be withdrawn at will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The interest rate and profitability obtained from [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] vary depending on the chosen duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Generally, the longer the duration of the deposit, the higher the interest rate and profitability will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is because providing the asset for a longer period gives Binance greater confidence and more time to generate returns, such as through commissions or providing market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Consider using [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] when you are certain the funds will not be needed, or for very long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Interest Calculation and Subscription Rules

*   **No Interest on Subscription Day:** Interest begins to be calculated from the second day after subscription. You will not receive interest on the day you subscribe and deposit your cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Subscription Hours:** Flexible product subscriptions are closed during UTC 23:50 to 00:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The same time restrictions apply to entering cryptocurrencies for [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Risks and Considerations

While savings products are generally not considered high-risk, it's important to be aware of potential risks, especially with [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Currency Devaluation:** If the deposited cryptocurrency depreciates significantly during the blocked period, you will not be able to withdraw your capital until the term ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Market Corrections:** Always consider the current market period. If the market is entering a correction phase, think carefully before locking your funds for 30, 90, or even 7 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Checking Your Savings and Earnings

After depositing funds, you can check your capital and accumulated interest in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Navigate to your wallet, then to the "Savings" section, where you will find tabs for flexible, locked, and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This section displays the total deposited amount, subscription date, and accumulated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The option to "redeem" allows you to withdraw your capital plus accumulated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

It is important to keep your assets actively producing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

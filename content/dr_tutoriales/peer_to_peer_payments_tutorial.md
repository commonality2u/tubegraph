Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments are defined as a [[currency_exchange_through_p2p | currency exchange]] from person to person (P2P) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method can often be more profitable than exchanging currency within a traditional bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. When engaging in [[using_p2p_trading_for_currency_conversion | P2P trading for currency conversion]], it's essential to consider price and commission charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Accessing P2P Commerce on Binance

To begin [[conducting_p2p_transactions_on_binance | conducting P2P transactions on Binance]], navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section and select "P2P Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Buying and Selling Cryptocurrencies

Within P2P commerce, you have the option to buy or sell coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This system facilitates an exchange between different types of coins with various users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### Price Determination
When selling, you set the price for your exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. When buying, another person sets the price, and you decide whether to accept that exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Filtering Options
On the "Buy" screen, you can:
*   Choose the currency you are working with (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Enter the amount of currency you wish to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   Select the cryptocurrency you want to buy (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Offers from other users are limited by specific ranges, indicating the minimum and maximum amounts they are willing to trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Key Considerations for P2P Transactions

### Checking Profitability and Volatility
Before making a purchase, always open the relevant graph (e.g., Bitcoin/Euro) in a new tab to assess the current market price and determine if the exchange is profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Cryptocurrency prices, like Bitcoin, are highly volatile and can change significantly day-to-day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. It's crucial to be attentive to these fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### Payment Methods
You must select your preferred payment method for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Not all users support every payment method due to various factors like country conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The most commonly used methods include bank transfers and [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Filtering by payment method will display users willing to use that option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### [[p2p_transaction_user_ratings_and_security | User Ratings]] and Security
One of the most critical aspects of P2P trading is checking the [[p2p_transaction_user_ratings_and_security | user ratings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This refers to the number of P2P transactions a user has completed and the percentage of those completed satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

After completing a P2P transaction, you can rate the other user based on speed, ease, and correct payment receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This system helps assess the risk, as there's a possibility of not being paid correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. You can view these statistics (e.g., 52 orders, 96.30% completed) below each user's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Preparing Funds for P2P Trading

To trade in P2P commerce, you must first transfer your capital to your P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

1.  Go to "Fiat and Spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
2.  Select "Transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
3.  Choose to transfer *from* your "Spot Wallet" *to* your "P2P Wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to transfer and confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

Once the transfer is successful, the bitcoins will appear in your P2P wallet, allowing you to trade and sell them in P2P commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Executing a P2P Transaction (Example)

When initiating a transaction (e.g., buying Bitcoin with Euros), a pop-up window will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This window displays the maximum and minimum amounts you can buy from that specific seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. It also shows the amount of cryptocurrency you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The seller's preferred payment method (e.g., bank transfer) and the payment time limit (e.g., 45-55 minutes) are also displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

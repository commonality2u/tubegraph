Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments on Binance are essentially person-to-person currency exchanges, often offering more favorable rates than traditional bank exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. When conducting [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | buying and selling cryptocurrencies on Binance]] through P2P, it's crucial to consider price and commission charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

If you don't yet have a Binance account, a [[tutorial_resources_for_binance_transactions | tutorial]] can help you create one with a 10% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Navigating to P2P Commerce

To begin [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | using Binance Exchange for transactions]] for P2P transactions, navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section at the top left of the Binance page and select "P2P Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Within the P2P section, you'll find options to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | buy and sell]] coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This exchange occurs between different users, with prices set by the individuals involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Buying Cryptocurrencies

When buying, you can:
*   Choose your working currency (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   Enter the amount of fiat currency you wish to convert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Select the cryptocurrency you want to buy (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Offers are limited and defined by users; for example, one user might have a buying limit of 200 to 380 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Checking Profitability

Before completing a purchase, it's highly recommended to open the market graph to assess the current price of the cryptocurrency and determine if the exchange is profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. For instance, if Bitcoin is trading at 27,663 Euros, but a P2P offer is listed at 36,000 Euros, the latter is not a good deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Cryptocurrency prices are highly volatile, so constant vigilance is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## Payment Methods

You can choose your preferred payment method for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Not all users accept every method due to various conditions (e.g., country, economic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The most commonly used methods are bank transfers and [[using_paypal_for_transactions_on_binance | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Filtering by a specific payment method, like [[using_paypal_for_transactions_on_binance | PayPal]], will show only users willing to transact with that method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## User Rating and Trustworthiness

A critical factor to consider is the user's rating, which reflects their P2P transaction history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. After a P2P transaction, users can rate each other based on speed, ease, and correct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. There is always a risk that a payment may not be received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

User ratings, including the number of orders placed and the percentage completed satisfactorily, are displayed below each user's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. A high completion rate is desirable, although an incomplete order might simply mean it hasn't been finalized yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Selling Cryptocurrencies

The principle for selling is similar to buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. You will want to sell at a higher price than the market rate, and you can choose the fiat currency you wish to receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Transferring to P2P Wallet

Before you can [[how_to_sell_bitcoin_on_binance | sell Bitcoin on Binance]] or other cryptocurrencies via P2P, you must [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | transfer]] the capital you wish to trade to your P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

To do this:
1.  Go to your Fiat and Spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
2.  Select "Transfer" for the cryptocurrency you wish to move (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
3.  Choose to transfer *from* the Spot wallet *to* the P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount or select "Maximum" and confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Once the transfer is successful, the cryptocurrencies will appear in your P2P wallet, allowing you to create and manage P2P sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Completing a Transaction

When you initiate a P2P buy or sell (e.g., buying Bitcoin for Euros), a pop-up window will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This window displays:
*   The maximum and minimum amounts you can transact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   The amount of cryptocurrency you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   The seller's accepted payment method (e.g., bank transfer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   The payment time limit (e.g., 45-55 minutes) within which the transfer must be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

You will need to introduce necessary information to complete the transaction, especially when selling your currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

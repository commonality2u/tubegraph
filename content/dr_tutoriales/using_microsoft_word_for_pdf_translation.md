This article details one of three [[methods_to_translate_a_pdf_document | methods]] to translate a PDF document, specifically utilizing Microsoft Word's built-in translation features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Prerequisites

For this method to be effective, the PDF document must contain recognized text, not a scanned image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. If the PDF is a scanned page, it is in image format, and this method will not work unless the image is first transformed into a text format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The document must be in text format for the translation process to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Scanned Documents
> This method is not suitable for translating scanned PDF documents that are in image format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Translation Process Using Microsoft Word

The first step in translating a PDF with Microsoft Word involves converting the PDF into an editable Word document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This process leverages the [[pdf_to_word_document_conversion | PDF to Word document conversion]] functionality within Word.

1.  **Open PDF with Word:** Right-click the PDF file and select "Open with," then choose "Microsoft Word" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This action converts the PDF into an editable text format within Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
2.  **Select Text for Translation:** Once the document is open in Word, select the specific text, such as an abstract from a scientific paper, that you wish to translate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Translation:** Right-click the selected text and choose the "Translate" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
4.  **Choose Target Language:** A translation panel will appear on the right side of the screen. Word automatically detects the source language (e.g., English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Select the desired target language for the translation (e.g., Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
5.  **Insert Translated Text:** After the translation is complete, you can click "Insert" to replace the original text with the translated version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

This method allows for the translation of individual paragraphs or the entire document by selecting all text and applying the translation function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. After translation, the document can be saved as a Word file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Comparison with Online Tools
> While Microsoft Word offers an integrated translation feature, [[translating_documents_with_google_translate | Google Translate]]'s document translation service is a completely free online service that does not impose limits or require pro subscriptions for document translation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Other [[online_translation_tools_for_pdfs | online translation tools for PDFs]] like DeepL might have character limits for free use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

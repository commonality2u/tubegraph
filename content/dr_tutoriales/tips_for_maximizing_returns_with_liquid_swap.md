Liquid Swap is a financial product offered by Binance that allows users to invest cryptocurrencies and financial assets to earn profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. By providing liquidity, users contribute their cryptocurrencies or other assets (like euros or dollars) to enable others to buy, convert, exchange, or sell those coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. In return, providers earn commissions generated from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Understanding Profitability and Risks

Profitability in Liquid Swap is based on the volume of transactions carried out with the coins you contribute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) displayed is not fixed and changes frequently, directly depending on the amount of transactions occurring for those cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Risk of Negative Returns
It's crucial to understand that profitability is not always guaranteed, and negative returns are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. If the price of the cryptocurrencies you've contributed drops faster than the commissions earned from transactions, your overall profitability can become negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Price Depreciation
> The value of your investment can decrease if the price of the cryptocurrencies you put into the pool goes down. If this depreciation outweighs the commissions earned, you will lose money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Strategies for Maximizing Returns

### 1. Choose High-Volume Cryptocurrencies
To mitigate risk and increase the likelihood of profitability, it is recommended to provide liquidity with cryptocurrencies that have a high transaction volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. High volume helps reduce risk and ensures fewer potential losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

### 2. Select Appropriate Liquidity Pools
Binance offers different types of liquidity pools:
*   **Stable Liquidity:** Products in this category typically have profitability that does not vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Innovation Liquidity:** These products may exhibit more variability in their profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Consider your risk tolerance when choosing between these options.

### 3. Add Both Currencies in a Pair
When providing liquidity for a pair (e.g., Bitcoin and BUSD), always add both currencies simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. If you add only one currency (e.g., Bitcoin or BUSD separately), you will be charged a commission, which reduces your overall profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### 4. Long-Term Deposit Strategy
For optimal returns, it is generally advised not to leave your money deposited in Liquid Swap for only a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The idea is to leave your funds for a relatively medium to long-term timeframe, allowing people to consistently use your money for transactions and enabling you to obtain sustained profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### 5. Review Terms and Conditions
Especially if you are new to this product, it is highly recommended to read the terms and conditions before using Liquid Swap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This ensures you understand all aspects of the service and the risks involved.

### 6. Monitor Your Participation and History
You can track your contributions and earnings by navigating to "My Participation" within the Liquid Swap section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This view shows how much you have contributed, your total yield, and daily profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The history section allows you to see past transactions, including when you added or withdrew liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

> [!INFO] Important Note on Fees
> While adding both currencies in a pair is free of commission, there might be commissions charged when withdrawing your money from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.

[[how_to_use_trust_wallet_step_by_step_in_2025 | Trust Wallet]] is an application designed for managing cryptocurrencies on mobile devices, available for both Android and iOS, offering the same [[trust_wallet_functionalities_for_android_and_ios | functionalities]] across both platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Getting Started

The first step to using Trust Wallet is to [[how_to_download_and_set_up_coinbase_wallet | download]] the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Once installed, users have the option to either import an existing wallet or create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Creating a New Wallet

To create a new wallet in Trust Wallet, follow these steps:
1.  **Select "Create a new wallet"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  **Accept the privacy policy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> and proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
3.  **Enter an access code or password** twice for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
4.  **Back up the wallet security** by noting down the 12-word secret phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The application warns that losing this phrase means permanent loss of funds and sharing it can lead to theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. It is highly recommended to copy this phrase onto physical paper rather than on a PC due to hacking vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
5.  **Verify the secret phrase** by re-entering the words in the correct order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
6.  Upon successful verification, the wallet will be created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Importing an Existing Wallet

If you already possess a wallet, you can import it into Trust Wallet:
1.  **Select "Import a wallet"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
2.  **Enter the secret phrase** (the 12 words) in the correct sequence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Input the wallet's password** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Wallet Management

Once a wallet is created or imported, users can manage it from the application. The application allows for the addition of new wallets, enabling users to manage multiple wallets from the same mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

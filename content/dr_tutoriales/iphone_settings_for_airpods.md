## Deactivating AirPods Notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>

To stop notifications from being read aloud by Siri through your [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods]]:

1.  Navigate to the **Settings** app on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
    *   Ensure your [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods]] are connected to your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.
2.  Scroll down and tap on **Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
    *   If you can't find "Notifications" immediately, use the search bar at the top by typing "notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
3.  Within the Notifications section, locate and select **Announce Notifications** under "Siri suggestions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
4.  Here, you will see an option to "Announce Notifications" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
    *   To [[deactivating_airpods_notifications | deactivate all notifications]] being read aloud, toggle off the "Announce Notifications" switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. If this switch is off, your iPhone will no longer read notifications aloud through your [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   If activated, notifications will be announced when you are wearing headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

> [!INFO] Responding without Confirmation
> When "Announce Notifications" is active, you may also have the option to respond to messages without confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Managing App-Specific Notifications via Siri <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>

You can also choose which specific apps allow Siri to announce their notifications through your [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Even if the general "Announce Notifications" setting is on, you can prevent specific apps from announcing notifications by finding them in the list below the main toggle and disabling their individual "Announce Notifications" switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   This means, for example, if you have "Announce Notifications" on for your headphones, but you don't want a specific app like "Fever" to notify you, you can turn off its individual announcement setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This will stop that particular app's notifications from being announced by the [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

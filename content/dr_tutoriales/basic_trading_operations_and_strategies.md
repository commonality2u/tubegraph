This tutorial provides a guide on how to use the Futures application within the Binance mobile device for [[leverage_trading_in_cryptocurrency | leverage]] and no leverage trading [00:00:04]. The aim is to teach important concepts to gain [[managing_cryptocurrency_to_maximize_profits | profitability]] from cryptocurrencies [00:00:24].

New users without a Futures account can use a referral link for a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, transactions, operations, or withdrawals [00:00:33]. Additional resources on [[investment_products_available_on_exchanges | investing cryptocurrencies]] for rent and compound interest are also available [00:00:49].

## Accessing and Navigating Binance Futures

To begin, open the Binance application on your mobile device [00:01:33]. The Futures section can be found in the menu at the bottom of the screen [00:01:39]. This section allows users to perform both purchase and sale operations across various markets [00:01:55].

Within the Futures option, different sections are presented:
*   **USDM (USDâ“ˆ-M Futures)**: This is the primary section for operations [00:02:08], allowing trading pairs against USD, such as Bitcoin/USD, Ethereum/USD, or IOTA/USD [00:03:31].
*   **CoinM (Coin-M Futures)**: Here, assets are compared to other cryptocurrencies, not the dollar [00:02:11].
*   **Options** [00:02:04].

This tutorial focuses on the USDM section [00:02:23].

## Funding Your Futures Account

Before trading, you must transfer funds from your Spot wallet to your Futures account [00:02:52].
1.  Navigate to "Wallet" [00:02:56].
2.  Go to the "Futures" section [00:02:59].
3.  Select "Transfer" [00:03:19].
4.  Funds must be transferred in USD, as it is the asset used for trading pairs within Futures (e.g., Bitcoin/USD, Ethereum/USD, IOTA/USD) [00:03:28].
5.  Specify the amount to transfer and confirm [00:03:55]. The transferred amount will then reflect in your Futures USD balance [00:04:02].

::: warning Avoid Loans
It is not recommended to use the loan or repayment options within the Futures wallet, as there is always an associated interest that can lead to significant losses [00:03:10].

## Key Futures Trading Concepts

### Margin Mode: Crossed vs. Isolated

When trading on Futures, it's crucial to select the correct margin mode. This setting determines how your margin is managed against your positions [00:04:42].
*   **Crossed Mode**: In this mode, all orders under the cross mode share the same asset balance [00:04:52]. If a position faces liquidation, all assets in your cross margin balance, along with any open positions, are at risk of being lost [00:04:56]. This means losses can intersect with funds in other wallets if the Futures wallet balance is insufficient [00:05:06].
*   **Isolated Mode**: The margin assigned to a position is restricted to a certain amount [00:05:22]. If this quantity is exceeded, only that specific position is liquidated [00:05:26]. This mitigates the risk of losing more money than what is specifically allocated to your Futures wallet [00:05:32].

::: info Recommendation
It is recommended to work in **Isolated** mode to limit potential losses to the amount allocated to a specific trade [00:05:20].

### Leverage

[[leverage_trading_in_cryptocurrency | Leverage]] allows traders to open positions larger than their available capital [00:05:40]. On Binance Futures, you can choose leverage from 1x up to 75x [00:05:40]. The selected leverage impacts the maximum size of the position you can open [00:05:52]. Higher leverage comes with higher risk, and the platform may issue warnings about high leverage [00:05:57].

### Financing Counter

The financing counter shows the average payment between traders for the next financing period [00:06:05]. If positive, long positions pay short positions. If negative, short positions pay long positions [00:06:15]. This is an important concept in Futures trading to understand periodic payments or receipts.

### Market Analysis Tools

While the tutorial doesn't delve deep into [[market_analysis_for_cryptocurrency_trading | market analysis]], it shows access to candlestick charts to visualize asset price movements, such as XRP/USD [00:06:29].

## Performing Basic Trading Operations

The tutorial demonstrates using the "Market" order type for [[strategic_buying_and_selling_in_cryptocurrency_markets | buying and selling]] cryptocurrencies [00:07:19]. A market order executes immediately at the best available market price [00:07:22].

To perform a market order:
1.  Select the desired asset (e.g., Bitcoin/USD, XRP/USD) [00:04:23].
2.  Choose "Market" as the order type [00:07:19].
3.  Enter the amount of the asset you wish to buy or sell (e.g., XRP amount) [00:07:28]. The cost will be displayed [00:07:35].
4.  Click "Buy" or "Sell" [00:07:24].
    *   Note: There might be a minimum quantity requirement for certain assets (e.g., a minimum of 5 XRP) [00:07:53].

## Managing and Closing Positions

Once an order is executed, it becomes an "open position" [00:09:54].
*   **PNL (Profit and Loss)**: The "PNL" or "NLP" value shows the current profit or loss of your operation, indicating if you are in positive or negative territory [00:09:58].
*   **Adjusting Leverage**: You can still adjust the leverage for an open position [00:10:08].
*   **Closing Operations**: To close an operation, you can place a sell order for the purchased asset [00:10:29]. For example, if you bought XRP, you would sell the XRP to close the position [00:11:09].
*   **Order History**: The order history allows you to view both open orders (none if all closed) and completed orders, showing details of past buys and sells [00:11:37].

The tutorial demonstrates a market buy operation with zero leverage (1x leverage, which is null) [00:11:56] and then a market sell to close the position [00:11:15].

## Important Considerations for Mobile Trading

While mobile trading offers flexibility, it requires agility and attentiveness due to the volatile nature of cryptocurrencies [00:10:49].
*   **Price Monitoring**: It is essential to continuously monitor prices and market fluctuations [00:10:59].
*   **Leverage Risk**: Be extremely careful with [[leverage_trading_in_cryptocurrency | leverage]], as it amplifies both profits and losses [00:11:04].
*   **Platform Recommendation**: It is generally recommended to work from a computer for better overview and control, and only use mobile for trading if you have a very clear strategy and are highly attentive to market movements [00:10:52].

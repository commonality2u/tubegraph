If you don't already have a session, you'll need to [[registering_and_setting_up_a_teacher_account_in_quizizz | register]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

While parents and companies can also participate, the teacher role is for test creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Navigating the Quizizz Interface

Upon accessing your Quizizz account, you'll see a left-hand panel with various options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Organizing Quizzes with Collections

Collections help in organizing your quizzes by theme or subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Creating a New Collection
You can create a new collection to save relevant quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. For example, a collection can be named "Math / Fractions" to store all mathematics quizzes related to fractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Once created, you can save quizzes into this new collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Memes in Quizzes
Quizizz often includes memes by default in quizzes, which are designed to relax students and make the tests less serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. These can appear at the beginning, middle, or end of tests, helping students feel more relaxed and potentially perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

The KuCoin platform offers opportunities to [[kucoin_investment_products | invest]] purchased cryptocurrencies and generate additional returns through features like staking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

## Investing Cryptocurrencies

KuCoin allows users to reinvest cryptoassets they have acquired, such as Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, or Cardano, into products that offer additional profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This strategy aims to generate profit from two sources:
1.  **Revaluation of the Cryptoasset:** The cryptocurrency itself may increase in market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>. For example, Cardano's price doubled from one dollar to two and a half dollars in a month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.
2.  **Annual Percentage from Investment Products:** By investing the cryptocurrency in an additional product, users can earn an annual percentage based on the amount invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Staking on KuCoin

Staking is one such product available on KuCoin that provides an annual percentage return on invested cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. For instance, if a user has 100 Cardano and stakes them, they could receive an annual return of five percent in Cardano <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>.

While the specifics of [[kucoin_investment_products | KuCoin's investment products]] and staking mechanisms are advanced topics to be covered in future tutorials, the platform is highlighted for its very interesting and attractive product offerings in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

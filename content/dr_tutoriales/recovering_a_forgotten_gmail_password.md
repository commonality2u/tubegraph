If you've forgotten your Gmail password, Google provides several methods to help you regain access to your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Important Prerequisite

It is vital to attempt recovery from a device (computer or mobile phone) that has previously accessed your email account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Google uses this information as a reference to help verify your identity and restore access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Recovery Methods for Forgotten Passwords

Here are the methods Google offers to help you recover a forgotten Gmail password:

### 1. Using Browser Settings (Previously Saved Passwords)

If you have previously accessed your Gmail account from your current device, you might be able to find the saved password in your browser's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This method is considered "super powerful" and useful if you've accessed the account before from the device you're using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

To do this in Google Chrome:
*   Open a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   Go to "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   Navigate to the "Autofill" section and select "Passwords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   In the "Search passwords" bar, type "gmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   This will display a list of all saved Gmail accounts and their passwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Click the eye icon next to the password to reveal it, which may require you to enter your computer's PIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### 2. Enter a Previously Used Password

When attempting to log in, if you remember any previous password you've used for that Gmail account, you can try entering it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Google may recognize it and allow you to proceed with recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### 3. Send Verification to a Recovery Email or Phone

Google can send a verification code to a [[methods_to_recover_gmail_using_a_recovery_email_or_phone | recovery email]] address or phone number associated with your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This is a common and effective method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

*   You will receive a code via the [[methods_to_recover_gmail_using_a_recovery_email_or_phone | recovery email]] or phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   Enter this code into the Google recovery prompt to verify your identity and reset your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### 4. Provide Another Email Account for Contact

If you don't have a recovery email or phone, Google might offer the option to provide another email account (which doesn't have to be associated with your Google account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Google will use this email to contact you and assist in recovering your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### 5. Answer Security Questions

As a last resort, Google may present a series of questions related to your account or personal details you provided during setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. You will need to answer these questions correctly to verify your identity and regain access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

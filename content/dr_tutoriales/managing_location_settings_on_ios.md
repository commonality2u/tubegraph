Managing your iPhone's location settings is crucial for [[privacy_and_security_in_ios | privacy and security]]. This guide outlines how to control location access for your device and individual applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Accessing Location Settings

To manage location settings on your iOS device:
1.  Open the **Settings** app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. If you can't find it, search for "adjustments" (which may be the local term for "Settings") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  Scroll down and tap on **Privacy & Security** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This section is often represented by a blue hand symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  Within **Privacy & Security**, you will find sections for "Localization" (Location Services) and "Tracking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Select **Location Services** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Global Location Control

Within Location Services, you have the option to:
*   **Disable Location Services Globally**: You can turn off location services entirely from this section. Deactivating it here will disable location access for all applications and features on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This is a form of [[disabling_iphone_location_services | disabling iPhone location services]].
*   **Location Sharing**: You can manage [[location_sharing_and_tracking_controls | location sharing and tracking controls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This includes features like "Find My iPhone," which remains active to help locate a lost or stolen device even if general location services are managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## App-Specific Location Permissions

A key feature is the ability to manage location access for individual applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This falls under [[appspecific_location_permissions | app-specific location permissions]] and helps prevent [[using_apps_to_access_metadata_and_geolocation | apps from accessing metadata and geolocation]] without your explicit control.

For each app listed, you can select one of the following options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   **Never**: The app will never have access to your location.
*   **Ask Next Time or When I Share**: The app will request permission each time it tries to use your location.
*   **While Using the App**: The app can only access your location when it is actively open and in use.
*   **Always**: The app can access your location even when it is in the background.

This allows you to customize location access based on the specific needs of each application, such as ride-sharing apps like Uber or Bolt, which typically require location services to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

This article outlines how to use the Western Union platform for sending money, primarily focusing on its online (computer-based) interface, while also acknowledging the availability of a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Western Union Online Platform Overview

The tutorial demonstrates the process of sending money through the Western Union online platform on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, specifically using the Spanish version of the website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. The platform allows users to send money to various countries with different currency conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Key Features and Processes on the Online Platform

#### Calculating Price and Fees
Users can calculate the price of a transfer to determine the cost based on the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The platform displays associated transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For example, a 100 Euro transfer to the USA might show a zero Euro transfer fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, but it's recommended to compare the exchange rate with real-time currency conversions to fully understand the actual costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. For instance, 100 Euros might convert to $106.68 in real-time, but the recipient might only receive $104.14 via Western Union, indicating an implicit charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

#### Sending Money Online vs. In-Person
Western Union offers options to send money "online" or to a "person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
- **Recipient options**: Money can be received in cash or via bank transfer (online) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
- **Sender payment options**: Payments for transfers are typically made online via bank transfer or credit/debit card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Cash payments are not an option for sending online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

#### Speed of Transfer and Implicit Fees
- **Credit/Debit Card**: Transfers made via credit or debit card can arrive in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
- **Bank Account**: Transfers to a bank account may take one business day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
- **Cash Pickup**: If the recipient is to receive cash, the transfer often arrives in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. However, sending money for cash pickup might involve higher implicit commissions, as the exchange rate can be less favorable compared to bank account transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This means the recipient might receive less money (e.g., $4 USB less for 100 Euro transfer) if it's sent for cash pickup instead of a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

#### [[steps_to_send_money_using_western_union | Steps to Send Money using Western Union]]
After calculating the price and choosing payment/reception methods, users proceed to:
1.  **Log In/Create Account**: Users must log in or create a new account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Account creation involves setting up a profile with name, surname, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
2.  **Recipient Details**: Enter the recipient's data, including their bank account details if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
3.  **Transaction Purpose**: Set the purpose of the transaction, origin of the money, and relationship with the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
4.  **Review and Confirm**: Review all transfer details, commissions, and recipient data before confirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. A receipt is provided upon confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
5.  **Fraud Prevention**: Western Union advises using its services only to send money to friends and family and warns against transferring money for suspicious reasons to prevent fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

#### Tracking Transfers
Users can track transfers using a serial number associated with each transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This functionality is available directly on the Western Union platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This feature is part of the broader [[western_union_money_transfer_tutorial | Western Union money transfer tutorial]].

#### [[western_union_rewards_and_referral_programs | Western Union Rewards and Referral Programs]]
Western Union offers a "My Western Union" (or "My W") program that rewards users with points for making transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. These points can lead to benefits like reduced commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Users need a My Western Union number, which is provided upon account verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Additionally, there is a referral program where referring a friend can earn an electronic gift code of up to $20 for the new account holder, provided they send at least $100 within 30 days of account creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Western Union Mobile App

While the tutorial primarily focuses on the computer platform, it states that money transfers can also be made using the Western Union mobile phone application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. The app is described as "very simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The functionalities and steps are expected to be similar to the online platform.

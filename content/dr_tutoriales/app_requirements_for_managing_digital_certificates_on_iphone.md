To [[using_electronic_id_card_for_mobile_devices | embed your electronic ID card]] and use digital certificates on a mobile device, certain requirements must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Digital Certificate Installation
Before attempting to install digital certificates on a mobile phone, it is indispensable to embed the digital certificate onto a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The electronic ID card itself is a container; it does not directly hold the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The digital certificate must first be installed on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, as this is a necessary step before transferring it to a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A separate video tutorial explains this initial process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Without completing those preliminary steps, the mobile installation will not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Mobile Device Considerations
The process for [[installing_digital_certificates_on_iphone | installing digital certificates on iPhone]] is demonstrated by recording the screen of an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### NFC Antenna
While apps on Android and iOS may not be exactly the same, the overall process is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A key difference lies in the NFC antenna:
*   On Android, the NFC antenna needs to be activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   On iPhone, the NFC antenna is already activated by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This antenna allows for mobile payments via apps like Apple Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. No special management is required for the iPhone's NFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Required Application
To [[steps_to_embed_digital_certificates_onto_a_mobile_phone | embed digital certificates onto a mobile phone]], a specific application must be downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Downloading the "Digital Certificate" App
The necessary application is called "Digital certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If not readily found, it can be located in the App Store by searching for "DNI" (electronic ID card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### App Verification
It is crucial to verify the creator of the application. The legitimate developer is "certified digital FNT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, ensuring data security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## [[Verification_and_installation_process_for_digital_certificates | Verification and Installation Process]] via App
Once the verified "Digital certificate" app is downloaded, open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Requesting and Managing Certificates
Within the app, you can choose to "Request the certificate digital" or "manage Digital Certificates Installed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Identity Verification Options
The app provides several options for verification:
*   Open a form and activate your mobile camera for a video identification service (which has a cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Apply in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Read the chip of your electronic ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. (This is the method demonstrated)

### Steps for Reading ID Chip
1.  Accept terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
2.  Enter an electronic email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
3.  Verify the email with a code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
4.  Enter the CAM code from your physical ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
5.  Enter the PIN associated with your electronic ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. (If you don't have a PIN or need to renew it, you must visit a police station, as explained in the prerequisite tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.)
6.  Place your ID card on a smooth surface and place your phone (without a case) near the top of the ID card until it detects the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The antenna is typically located at the top of the mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
7.  Confirm the request for the Citizen's Certificate issued by the National Factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Certificate Installation on Mobile Device
After requesting, a notification will confirm when the certificate is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
1.  Click on the option to "Install on mobile device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
2.  Accept the terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
3.  Create a password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
4.  Allow the website to download a profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
5.  Once the profile is downloaded, check it in the iPhone's Settings app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. It will appear under "Profile Downloaded" for the Certificate of Identity, or in the "VPN & Device Management" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
6.  Hit "Install," enter your phone's code, and then the password you created for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Once these steps are completed, the configuration is installed, and the digital certificate is active on the iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. You can then view your installed certificates within the FNT app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

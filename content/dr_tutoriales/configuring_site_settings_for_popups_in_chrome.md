This tutorial outlines how to activate and manage popup windows within Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It provides steps for both enabling pop-ups globally and blocking them for specific websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Accessing Google Chrome Settings

To begin configuring popup settings, open Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "configuration" (settings) section, located in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Click on "advanced settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  From here, you have two options to find the site configuration for popups:
    *   **Search Bar:** Type "emerging" (popups) into the "search settings" bar, and "site configuration" will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
    *   **Manual Navigation:** Go to "privacy and security" on the left-hand side, then click on "site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Within "site configuration," you can control pop-up settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

1.  Scroll down to find the option "Pop-ups and redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
2.  By default, this setting is usually configured to "not allowing sites to send pop-up windows or use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  To enable pop-ups for all sites, click on the option and toggle it to "Allow sites to send pop-ups and use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## [[blocking_specific_sites_from_sending_popups_in_chrome | Blocking Specific Sites from Sending Pop-ups]]

Even if pop-ups are generally enabled, you can prevent specific sites from sending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

1.  Under the "Pop-ups and redirects" setting, you will find an option to "Block" specific sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  Click "Add" next to the "Block" list.
3.  Enter the URL of the site you wish to block. For example, to stop pop-ups from YouTube, enter `www.youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
4.  Click "Add" to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Once added, that specific site will no longer send pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

This allows for flexible control over pop-ups, offering options to activate them for all pages, disable them for all pages, or activate them selectively while blocking specific ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

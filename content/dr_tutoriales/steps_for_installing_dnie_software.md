Activating your [[how_to_activate_an_electronic_id | electronic ID]] (DNIe) involves obtaining a PIN code, installing necessary software, and using a DNIe reader to validate the certificate. This guide outlines the steps for software installation on a Windows computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning the software installation, ensure you have:
*   **PIN Key**: This code is issued on the day you receive your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If you don't have it, you can obtain it from automatic machines at your nearest police station by logging in with your ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
*   **DNIe Reader**: A physical ID card reader is required to read your DNIe's chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. An example of a compatible reader is provided in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Identifying Your System Type

It's crucial to download the correct software version (64-bit or 32-bit) for your operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
To check your system type:
1.  Open **File Explorer** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  Navigate to **This PC** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  Right-click on **This PC** and select **Properties** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  Your system type (e.g., "64-bit operating system") will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Downloading Required Software

You will need two main software components, accessible via links typically found in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
1.  **Government Headquarters Software**: This is often referred to as the FNMT Configurator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  **Electronic Signature Software**: Often referred to as "self-signature" software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Select the version (e.g., 64-bit) that matches your computer's operating system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Installation of FNMT Configurator

The first software to install is the FNMT Configurator:
1.  Locate the downloaded configurator file and run it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  Click **Yes** when prompted to allow the app to make changes to your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
3.  Follow the installer prompts: click **Next**, accept the terms and conditions, and choose the installation directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
4.  Proceed with the installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
5.  Once installation is complete, click **Next** and then **Finish** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The installer may remind you that self-signing is needed for different options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Installation of Self-Signature Software

Next, install the self-signature software:
1.  Locate the downloaded self-signature file and double-click to run it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  Click **Yes** when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
3.  Click **Next**, accept the terms, and note the installation directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
4.  If you use Firefox, ensure the option to rely on the root is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
5.  Click **Install** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
6.  Once complete, click **Next** and then **Finish** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

After both installations, you should see the self-signature application installed on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Connecting the DNIe Reader

Once the software is installed, connect your DNIe reader:
1.  Insert your DNIe into the reader, ensuring the chip is correctly aligned for reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
2.  Connect the DNIe reader to your computer via a USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Your computer should indicate that the device is connected and reading the ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Validating the DNIe Certificate

To verify that your DNIe and reader are working correctly with the installed software:
1.  Access the certificate validation link (often provided with the "signature or FNMT" download, usually in the video's first comment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
2.  Click on the option to **Validate Certificate** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
3.  You may be prompted to open the self-signature application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This application reads the electronic certificates stored within your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
4.  From the list of associated certificates (e.g., authentication, signature), select the electronic DNI signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
5.  Enter your secret PIN code when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
6.  The system should then confirm that your certificate is valid, displaying your name, surname, and ID card details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This indicates that your DNIe software has been successfully installed and your electronic ID is ready for use.

Binance offers a referral program that allows users to invite friends to the platform, providing benefits for both the referrer and the referred party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This program enables users to earn crypto commissions from the trading activities of their invited friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Accessing the Referral Program

To access the referral program on the desktop interface, navigate to your profile by hovering the mouse over it, and then select the "Referral Program" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## How the Referral System Works

The [[how_binance_referrals_work | Binance referral system]] operates by allowing a person to open an account using your unique referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. When the referred person completes operations like deposits, transactions, or withdrawals, they receive a discount on their commissions (e.g., 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. In return, the referrer also receives a percentage of those commissions, typically starting at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

It is recommended to use or share referral links with individuals who plan to make significant investments or use their funds for cryptocurrency trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Referral Program Dashboard

The referral program dashboard provides several sections for [[analyzing_referral_and_commission_statistics_on_Binance | analyzing referral and commission statistics]]:
*   **Control Panel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **List of Links** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **Friends List** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   **Commission History** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **Shared Commissions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>

You can see the total amount of Bitcoin earned from referrals, the number of transactions made by referred users, and the total number of referrals you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. A classification based on earned Bitcoin from referrals is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Generating Referral Links

Users can [[setting_up_and_managing_binance_referral_programs | generate new referral links]] and customize the commission percentage split between themselves and the referred friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Options typically include 0%, 5%, or 10% for the referred user, with the remainder going to the referrer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Higher percentages, such as 15% or 20% for the referrer (with 0% for the referred user), become available once the account balance exceeds 500 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Referral Statistics and Commission Details

The platform allows you to view the number of friends who have opened accounts using a specific referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. While specific names are not displayed for privacy reasons, the User ID (Yiddish) is shown, along with the type of account they hold (Spot, Mining, Futures), and their registration time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. You can also see if they have conducted operations and in which areas (e.g., Spot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

The commission history can be filtered by different account types (all accounts, Spot, Futures, Mining) to see earnings from referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Importantly, commissions are received in the same cryptocurrency that the referred user traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For example, if a referred person buys BNB, the referrer will receive BNB in their wallet, not Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

## Using the Binance Referral Program on Mobile

To access the [[navigating_and_understanding_binance_app_features | Binance referral program]] on a mobile device:

To begin operating within the Binance Futures application, it is necessary to [[transferring_and_managing_cryptocurrency_assets | transfer funds]] from your existing wallet to your futures account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:01">[02:52:01]</a>.

## Accessing the Futures Wallet
To transfer money, navigate to the "wallet" section within the mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:49">[02:56:49]</a>. Once in the wallet, select the "futures" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:47">[02:59:47]</a>.

## Transferring Capital
Within the futures wallet, locate the "transfer" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:22">[03:07:22]</a>. It is recommended to use the "transfer" option rather than "loan" or "repayment," as loans typically incur associated interest, which can lead to unnecessary financial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:29">[03:10:29]</a>.

The transfer should be made from your Spot wallet to your futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:40">[03:21:40]</a>.

### Currency for Transfer
It is essential to [[how_to_deposit_money_into_binance | transfer funds]] in USD (USD Stablecoin, such as USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:07">[03:28:07]</a>. This is because USD is the primary asset used for operations within futures, as it is consistently exchanged with various cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin (BTC) and Ethereum (ETH) (e.g., BTC/USD, ETH/USD, IOTA/USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:43">[03:29:43]</a>.

After selecting the amount to transfer, confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:54">[03:55:54]</a>. A "transfer complete" message will indicate the successful addition of funds to your futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:11">[04:02:11]</a>.

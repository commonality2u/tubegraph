Google Forms offers various ways to [[managing_survey_responses_in_google_forms | manage survey responses]], including options to export data for further analysis in other software like Excel or Google Sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Accessing and Managing Responses

To quickly [[how_to_view_responses_in_google_forms | view responses]] from a Google Form, navigate directly to the "Responses" tab within your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Here, you can see the total number of responses received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

From this section, you can configure several options by clicking on the three-dot menu:
*   Receive email notifications for new responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Select where responses will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Unlink the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Exporting Response Data

Google Forms provides direct methods to export your response data:

*   **Download Responses in CSV Format**: You can download all responses in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This CSV file can then be opened and analyzed in spreadsheet programs like Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Open in Google Sheets**: For seamless integration, responses can be opened directly in [[analyzing_google_forms_responses_using_google_sheets | Google Sheets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This displays the data grouped by timestamp, showing the date, hour, and minute of each response, along with all the submitted answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

To export to [[analyzing_google_forms_responses_using_google_sheets | Google Sheets]], navigate to the "Responses" tab and click "View in Sheets" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Internal Response Views

Before or after exporting, you can [[visualizing_individual_and_summary_responses_in_google_forms | visualize responses]] directly within Google Forms in different ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>:

*   **Summary Tab**: This view provides a global overview of all responses, ideal for [[visualizing_individual_and_summary_responses_in_google_forms | analyzing overall trends]] and aggregate data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Question Tab**: Allows you to view responses organized by each specific question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, you can see everyone who responded to a particular question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Individual Tab**: Shows each respondent's answers individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This is useful for reviewing specific submissions, such as exam answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

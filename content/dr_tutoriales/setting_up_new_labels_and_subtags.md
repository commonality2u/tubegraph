[[organizing_emails_with_labels | Organizing emails]] in Gmail with labels and sub-labels (nested tags) helps keep your inbox tidy and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. By default, a Gmail account will show emails categorized by news, subscriptions, and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, you can configure custom labels to suit your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Accessing Label Settings

1.  Log in to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the right side of the screen and click on "configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  From the configuration options, select the "labels window" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This window displays all labels that appear in the left-hand tray of your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[creating_labels_in_gmail | Creating Labels]]

To create new labels for your emails:

1.  In the "labels window," look for the option to [[creating_labels_in_gmail | create new labels]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
2.  Enter the desired name for your label. For instance, you could create a label named "YouTube" to categorize all emails related to your YouTube activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Creating Sub-Labels (Nested Tags)

Once you have a main label, you can create sub-labels to further refine your organization:

1.  Within the main label (e.g., "YouTube"), you can [[organizing_emails_with_labels | create different tags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  As an example, to create a sub-label for "comments":
    *   Create a new label and name it "comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   When prompted to nest the tag, select "YouTube" as the parent label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   This will place "comments" visually indented under "YouTube" in your label list, indicating it is a sub-label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
3.  You can repeat this process to create other sub-labels, such as "clips," also nested under "YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Managing Existing Labels

*   **Deleting Labels**: If you wish to remove a label, you can select it and click the "delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Modifying Labels**: To change a label's name or other properties, select it and choose "modify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying Labels to Emails

To categorize your emails using your new labels:

1.  Search for emails that you want to apply a specific label to (e.g., search for "subscription" to find subscription emails) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  Select all the relevant emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  Right-click on the selected emails, hover over "tag how," and then choose the appropriate label (e.g., "YouTube subscriptions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These emails will now appear under that specific label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## [[using_color_coding_for_email_labels | Color-Coding Labels]]

To further distinguish your labels, you can [[using_color_coding_for_email_labels | apply colors]]:

1.  Go back to the label settings.
2.  Select the main label (e.g., "YouTube").
3.  Choose a color for it, such as red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
4.  You can also apply the same color to its sub-labels (e.g., "comments," "subscriptions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
5.  Now, when you view your inbox, emails associated with these labels will appear in the chosen color, making them easy to identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

This method provides a basic yet useful way to [[organizing_emails_with_labels | filter and organize your emails]] by tags <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

This tutorial explains how to increase the volume of your microphone on a Windows 10 computer or laptop. This can improve audio quality for subsequent editing, streaming, or other platforms, ensuring listeners hear with perfect clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Method 1: Adjusting Through Windows Sound Settings

This method utilizes the built-in sound settings in Windows 10 to boost your microphone's volume.

1.  **Access Sound Settings**:
    *   Go to the Start taskbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
    *   Type "sound" in the search bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
    *   Select [[accessing_sound_settings_on_windows_10 | Sound settings]] from the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Input**:
    *   Within the sound settings, go to the "Input" section (referred to as the "entrance part" in the transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. The "Output" section is for speakers and sound output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
3.  **Select Microphone and Adjust Properties**:
    *   Ensure the microphone you wish to adjust is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The audio volume should increase as you speak, indicating it's active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Click on "Device properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   In the device properties, the [[adjusting_microphone_properties_and_levels | microphone volume]] can be set to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This represents the maximum volume your microphone can capture without reducing sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

    > [!IMPORTANT] Audio Quality Note
    > If you attempt to increase the volume beyond this point (if an option is available), the quality of your sound may decrease considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Lowering the volume, however, keeps it within the quality allowed by the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

4.  **Alternative "Levels" Tab (for some Windows 10 versions)**:
    *   Some computers, particularly those not using the very latest Windows 10 interface, might display a different window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    *   If this window appears, go to the "Levels" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Here, you should see the microphone level, which can be set to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Apply the changes for the volume to be at its maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Method 2: Utilizing Third-Party Software (e.g., OBS)

A second method involves using third-party software, often used for screen recording or streaming, such as OBS (Open Broadcaster Software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Such programs can facilitate recording videos with desired volume levels, and these videos can then be modified or converted to audio format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

1.  **Download and Open Software**:
    *   A link to download the software might be provided in the video description or comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  **Access Microphone Settings**:
    *   Within the software, navigate to the "Microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
    *   Go to "settings," then "properties," and choose the microphone you want to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  **Adjust Advanced Audio Properties**:
    *   Go to the "Audio Mixer" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   Right-click and select "Advanced Audio Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   This window displays different microphones or audio sources interacting in the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
4.  **Increase Microphone Volume**:
    *   Locate the specific microphone you are recording with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   The standard volume typically starts at 0.0 decibels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This usually corresponds to the 100% selected in Windows settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
    *   You can progressively increase the volume from here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

    > [!WARNING] Volume vs. Quality Trade-off
    > Increasing volume using this technique might reduce the quality of the audio, making it sound slightly worse but louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This trade-off should be kept in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Both methods are useful for raising microphone volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### How to Perform Internal Transfers
From the "Spot Wallet" (your main wallet), you can transfer assets to other wallets depending on your activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>:
*   **To P2P Account:** If you want to engage in [[understanding_market_and_limit_orders_on_binance | P2P trading]], you would transfer cryptocurrency from your Spot Wallet to your P2P account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **To Futures Wallet:** For [[understanding_market_and_limit_orders_on_binance | futures trading]], you would move funds to your Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   **For Investing:** If you plan to invest in products offered by Binance, transfer the necessary funds to the relevant wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

You can select the cryptocurrency and specify the amount for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The process can also be reversed (e.g., from P2P to Fiat and Spot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Important Note on Fiat Withdrawals
Some traditional banks (like Santander, Sabadell, or BBVA in Spain) may block transactions from cryptocurrency platforms, preventing the capital from reaching your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Consider using alternative banking solutions that are more crypto-friendly for fiat deposits and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, such as:
*   N26 account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
*   Revolut bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>

These accounts are less likely to block transactions with cryptocurrency platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

After [[merging_pdf_files | merging]] PDF documents using an online tool like [[using_i_love_pdf_to_join_pdfs | I Love PDF]], the newly combined file can be easily downloaded and managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## How to Download

Once PDFs have been [[merging_pdf_files | merged]] into a single document, it becomes available for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. To access the combined PDF:
*   Click the "Download merged PDF" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   The merged file will typically be found in your computer's "Downloads" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   An example merged file might be named "Multicinema Safari Merge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
*   Upon opening the downloaded file, both original documents (e.g., two invoices) will be present together within the single PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### File Compression
If a [[merging_pdf_files | merged]] PDF becomes very large or "heavy," it can be compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Tutorials are available to learn how to [[using_i_love_pdf_for_file_compression | compress PDFs]] easily on both phone and computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Renaming the Merged PDF

The name of the downloaded merged PDF can be edited at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This allows users to customize the filename for better organization and identification.

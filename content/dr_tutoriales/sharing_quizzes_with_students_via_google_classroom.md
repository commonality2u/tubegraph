Quizizz allows educators to easily share tests and questionnaires with their students online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Teachers [[how_to_register_and_set_up_a_quizizz_account_for_teachers | register as a teacher]] because they are the ones who design and share the tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Connecting with Students

Students can connect to the platform and receive notifications for different questionnaires through:
*   **Google Classrooms** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>
*   **A simple link** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

This connection ensures that all students are linked and receive real-time notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The "classes" section on the left panel is where the group of students is managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

## Assigning Quizzes

Once a questionnaire is created (see [[creating_and_importing_quizzes_on_quizizz | Creating and Importing Quizzes]]), teachers can share it with their students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### Scheduled Assignment
Quizzes can be assigned to classes for a specific date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. The questionnaire will then be delivered to the students at the exact time set by the teacher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. For example, a teacher can set a quiz to be assigned on May 14th at 12:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Immediate Practice
For immediate sharing or practice, teachers can select the "practice" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This generates a direct link that can be copied and shared with students, allowing them to access and play the quiz whenever they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

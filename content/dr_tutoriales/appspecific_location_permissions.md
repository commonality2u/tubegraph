Users can manage [[managing_location_settings_on_ios | location settings]] for individual applications on their mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This allows for control over when and how apps access location data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Accessing Location Settings

To manage app-specific location permissions, navigate to the device's settings:
1.  Open "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  Scroll down and select "[[privacy_and_security_in_ios | Privacy & Security]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  Within this section, locate "Localization" (location services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. There is also a "[[location_sharing_and_tracking_controls | tracking]]" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Global Location Service Controls

Within the "Localization" section, location services can be turned on or off globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. If location services are [[disabling_iphone_location_services | deactivated]] here, they will be disabled for all applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

Other general settings include:
*   **Location Sharing** The option to cancel [[location_sharing_and_tracking_controls | location sharing]] is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Find My iPhone** An option to activate "Find My iPhone" is available for locating a lost or stolen device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Managing Permissions for Individual Applications

Users can manage and remove location permissions for different applications individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Examples of applications that may request location access include Air Canada, Volt, and La Compass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

For each application, users can select from the following options for location usage:
*   **When Using the App** The application can use location services only when it is actively being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Ask Next Time** The application will prompt for permission each time it attempts to use location services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Never** The application is prevented from ever using location services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Always** The application can always use location services, even in the background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

The management of location permissions depends on the specific application and its intended use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Some applications, such as Uber or Bolt, might require location services to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

This guide provides a [[step_by_step_tutorial_for_unlocking_excel_files | step-by-step tutorial]] on how to remove a password from an Excel file that you cannot access or have forgotten the password for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Steps to Remove an Excel Password

1.  **Open the Password-Protected Excel File**: Begin by opening the Excel file that has the password protection you wish to remove <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. For example, a file named "finances" that requires a password (e.g., "SD") to open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to File**: Once the file is open, go to the "File" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
3.  **Access Info**: On the left-hand side menu, click on "Info" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
4.  **Select Protect Workbook**: Within the "Info" section, locate and click on "Protect Workbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This option should be enabled, indicating the workbook is protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   This feature also allows for [[protecting_and_unprotecting_excel_workbooks | protecting specific sheets]] or structures, which can be useful for [[managing_confidential_data_in_excel | confidential data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
5.  **Choose Encrypt with Password**: From the "Protect Workbook" options, select "Encrypt with password" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
6.  **Remove the Password**: The current password for the workbook will be displayed in the text box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. To remove it, simply delete the existing password from this box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
7.  **Confirm**: Click "OK" to apply the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The file is no longer protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Verification

After removing the password:
1.  Close the Excel file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Ensure you save the changes when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
3.  Re-open the file. It should now open without prompting for a password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

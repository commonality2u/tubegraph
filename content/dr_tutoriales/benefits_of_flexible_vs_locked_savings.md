BNB Vault (also known as BNB Bolt or BNB Trunk) is a financial product offered on Binance that allows users to earn returns by investing their Binance Coin (BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This feature can generate significant profitability by obtaining other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## How to Access BNB Vault

To access BNB Vault, navigate to the "Binance" section at the top of the menu, then select "Finance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This area lists all financial products offered by Binance, including both flexible and fixed terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Investing in BNB Vault

BNB Vault is exclusively for investing BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Unlike other products, it does not support investments in Bitcoin, Ethereum, Polkadot, or other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The core concept is to hold your BNB to generate other cryptocurrencies as rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

Users can also enable an automatic transfer option, which, if activated, will use available balances in spot accounts to buy [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] for BNB Vault every day at 1 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This feature can be activated or deactivated as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Benefits of BNB Vault vs. Launchpool

While both BNB Vault and [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]] allow users to generate cryptocurrencies by staking BNB, BNB Vault offers superior benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Launchpool
[[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]] is a tool that generates new cryptocurrencies using existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. For example, by investing BNB in [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]], users might obtain annual returns of 5% in one currency and 3.76% in another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. However, [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]] only provides the cryptocurrencies offered by its system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### BNB Vault
Investing BNB in BNB Vault provides multiple reward streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>:
*   **Launchpool Rewards**: BNB Vault automatically allocates BNB to [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]] projects, allowing users to receive new cryptocurrencies offered through those campaigns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Savings Rewards**: In addition to [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]] rewards, BNB Vault also provides additional rewards from [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This means users earn cryptocurrency rewards in two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Other Rewards**: BNB Vault also offers other rewards based on periodic programs, including random rewards and additional cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Ultimately, investing BNB in BNB Vault leads to more cryptocurrencies and benefits compared to directly investing in [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Launchpool]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Flexible Nature of BNB Vault

A significant benefit of BNB Vault is its [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Users can withdraw their BNB at any time without being subject to [[blocked_savings_on_binance | locked staking]] periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This makes BNB Vault a secure and adaptable investment option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

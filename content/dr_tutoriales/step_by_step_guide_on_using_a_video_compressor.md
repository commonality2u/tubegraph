This guide provides instructions on how to use a video compressor application to reduce video file sizes, particularly for sending via WhatsApp.

## Why Compress Videos?
Videos often have a capacity limit when being sent through messaging applications like WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Compressing videos allows them to be sent without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This process involves [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reducing the video file size]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Finding and Downloading the App
To begin, you will need to download a video compressor application:
1.  **Open the App Store:** Go to the App Store on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Search for "Video Compressor":** Type "video compressor" into the search bar exactly as it is written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
3.  **Select the Recommended App:** From the list of options, choose the specific app that features less advertising and fewer payment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. While many apps are useful, this particular one is recommended for its user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This is one of the available [[video_compression_apps_for_mobile_devices | video compression apps for mobile devices]].
4.  **Download the App:** Proceed to download the selected [[features_of_a_video_compressor_app | video compressor app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Compressing a Video Step-by-Step
Once the application is downloaded, follow these steps to compress a video:
1.  **Open the Application:** Launch the video compressor app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Select "Compress a Video":** Within the app, choose the option to "compress a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
3.  **Choose a Video from Your Gallery:** Navigate to your video gallery and select the video you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For example, a 3-minute video that is 34.6 megabytes can be chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Compression Percentage:** The app will present compression indices, allowing you to specify how much you want to compress the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A higher percentage of reduction indicates greater compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   For instance, reducing from 34.6 megabytes to 29.4 megabytes could be an 85% compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   To allow the video to pass on WhatsApp while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining quality limits]], a reduction to 70% is recommended, which can reduce the size by about 10 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
5.  **Understand Compression Modes:** The app offers a "normal" mode that automatically reduces rates and an "advanced" mode for manual adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
6.  **Initiate Compression:** Once satisfied with the settings, tap the "compress" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
7.  **Wait for Compression to Complete:** The compression process typically takes about 20 to 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Saving the Compressed Video
After the compression is complete, the video will be ready for saving:
1.  **Save the Video:** Tap the "save" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
2.  **Verify in Gallery:** The compressed video will be saved in your device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. You can then go to the gallery to view your newly compressed video alongside the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This is the final step in [[exporting_and_saving_compressed_video_files | exporting and saving compressed video files]].

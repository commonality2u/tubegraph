When [[managing_survey_responses_in_google_forms | managing survey responses in Google Forms]], you can easily set up notifications to be alerted whenever new responses are submitted. After navigating to your form, you will find a "Responses" tab which displays the submitted data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Receiving Email Notifications

To enable email notifications for new responses:
1.  Go to the "Responses" tab of your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  Click on the three dots icon within the Responses section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  Select the option to "receive an email notification every time someone responds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Other Response Management Options

From the same three-dot menu, you can also access other useful options for managing your form responses, including:
*   Selecting where responses will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Unlinking the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   [[exporting_google_forms_responses_to_csv_or_excel | Downloading responses in CSV format]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
*   Opening responses in [[analyzing_google_forms_responses_using_google_sheets | Google Sheets]] or [[exporting_google_forms_responses_to_csv_or_excel | Excel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This allows for more detailed [[analyzing_google_forms_responses_using_google_sheets | analysis]] of the data, grouped by timestamp, date, and time of submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

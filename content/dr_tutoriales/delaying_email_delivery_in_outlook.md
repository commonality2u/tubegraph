Outlook allows users to [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | schedule emails]] to be sent at a specific future date and time, providing greater control over communication flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This feature is simple to configure within the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## How to Schedule an Email for Later Delivery

### Creating the Email
First, open Outlook and navigate to the mail section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Click on "New Email" to compose a new message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Fill in the recipient, subject, and body of the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The email can also include a [[configuring_signatures_for_different_email_accounts_in_outlook | signature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Accessing Delay Delivery Options
Once the email is composed, go to the "Options" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Here, select "Delay Delivery" (or "delay shipment" if the interface is in English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Setting Delivery Date and Time
Within the delay delivery settings, pay special attention to the "Do not deliver before" or "Delivery before" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This option allows you to [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | program]] the email to be sent at a specific time and day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Choose the desired day and time for the email to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. After setting the date and time, click "Close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, then "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The email will not be sent immediately but will remain scheduled in the Outbox until the specified time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Important Considerations for Scheduled Emails

### Outlook Application Must Be Open
It is [[important_considerations_for_scheduled_emails | very important to understand]] that a [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduled shipment of mail]] will only be sent if the computer is on and the Outlook application is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. If Outlook is not open at the scheduled delivery time, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This is considered a weak point in Outlook's functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Setting an Expiration Date
Within the delay delivery options, you can also set an expiration date for the scheduled email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. If, for example, the email is scheduled for tomorrow at a certain time, but Outlook is not open at that time, you can set [[setting_email_expiration_in_outlook | this expires]] date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This determines the [[setting_email_expiration_in_outlook | expiration of this schedule of the mail]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Updating a Scheduled Email's Delivery Time
To modify the delivery time of an already scheduled email, locate it in the Outbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Click on the scheduled email to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Go back to the "Options" tab and select "Delay Delivery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Here, you can change the delivery date or time to a new preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. After making changes, click "Close" and then "Send" again to [[updating_scheduled_email_settings_in_outlook | update the schedule of Mail sending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Remember that Outlook must be open at the new scheduled time for the email to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

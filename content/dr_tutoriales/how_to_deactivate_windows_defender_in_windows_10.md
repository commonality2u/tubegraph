## Steps to Deactivate Windows Defender

To deactivate Windows Defender, follow these steps:

1.  **Access Windows Security**:
    *   On your computer, go to the Windows taskbar (from bottom to top on the left) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Type the word "defend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Select the "Windows Security" option, specifically under "Antivirus protection against threats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, you can access Windows Defender from the left-hand menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

2.  **Manage Antivirus and Threat Protection Settings**:
    *   Once inside the "Antivirus protection against threats" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, navigate to the option titled "Antivirus protection against threats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
    *   Proceed to the part for [[windows_defender_configuration_management | managing the configuration]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

3.  **Disable Protection Settings**:
    *   To deactivate Windows Defender, you will need to change the blue bar from "on" to "deactivated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   Begin by disabling "Real-time protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. You will be prompted with a confirmation asking if you want to allow the application to make changes to the device; select "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Continue by deactivating "Cloud-based protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Also disable "Automatic sample submission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
    *   Deactivate "Tamper protection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Confirmation of Deactivation

Once all these settings are turned off, Windows Defender will be completely deactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. You can verify this by returning to the start section of Windows Security, where you should see a red cross indicating that antivirus protection is totally disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

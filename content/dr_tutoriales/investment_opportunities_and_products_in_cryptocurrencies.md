This article compares three major cryptocurrency exchange platforms—Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance—to determine which is more beneficial for buying cryptocurrencies and investing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The comparison focuses on account fees, deposit fees, trading fees, investment products (like staking), and withdrawal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Account Creation

Creating an account on Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, or Binance is free of charge, with no fees incurred for simply having an account on any of these exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

## Deposit Fees

Deposit fees vary significantly across platforms:
*   **Coinbase** charges a commission of 1% to 4% for deposits, depending on the range and origin of the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. For example, users from Chile may face a 3.99% fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro** is significantly cheaper, with SEPA transfers costing 0.15 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   **Binance** offers varied commissions depending on the payment method:
    *   Bank transfers (SEPA, SWIFT) for EUR or USD generally incur zero commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.
    *   Deposits via Visa or Mastercard can incur an 1.8% charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
    *   It is generally recommended to use bank transfers for deposits as paying with cards incurs significantly higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
    *   Users can save up to 10% on [[crypto_currency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | Binance commissions]] by using a referral link when opening an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

Binance is highlighted as the winner for deposits due to its zero-commission options for bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

## Trading Fees

[[exploring_trading_markets_for_cryptocurrency_conversion | Trading commissions]] are another critical factor:
*   **Binance** has a base commission of 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. This rate can be reduced significantly, down to 0.02% across up to nine levels, by holding more Bitcoin or [[investing_with_bnb_vs_bitcoin | BNB]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
*   Furthermore, if you pay [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | trading commissions]] using BNB, the fees are reduced by an additional 25% (e.g., from 0.1% to approximately 0.075%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This applies if you have BNB in flexible savings or your spot wallet and have the option selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.
*   **Coinbase** charges fixed commissions that also depend on the amount of Bitcoin or money held, ranging from 0.99 Euros to 3 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro** commissions range from 0.04% to 0.50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>.

Binance is considered superior for trading due to its significantly lower commissions, offering up to five times less in fees compared to Coinbase Pro for typical users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

## Investment Products and Opportunities

Binance offers a wide array of [[crypto_currency_investment_strategies | investment products]] for cryptocurrencies, making it a strong platform for earning returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.

*   **Binance Savings and Staking**: The platform provides flexible products, locked products, and high-risk options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Within each category, there are multiple distinct products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
    *   Users can obtain high returns, such as a 4.90% to 21.60% annual percentage yield (APY) for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
    *   [[risks_and_profitability_of_cryptocurrency_staking | Locked staking]] allows users to lock capital for a set number of days (e.g., 15 days) to earn annual profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. For example, staking CAKE for 15 days can yield 37.49% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.
*   **Other Platforms**: Coinbase and Coinbase Pro offer much more limited [[how_to_provide_liquidity_with_cryptocurrencies | investment and staking products]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38:00">[11:38:00]</a>.

Binance is deemed the clear winner for its diverse and high-yielding investment products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.

    *   Withdrawing to a bank card charges 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>.

*   **Coinbase**: Charges up to 4% or a maximum of 10 Euros per withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:00">[13:23:00]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: Generally offers lower withdrawal fees for certain methods, such as wire transfers for GBP (less than Binance) and SEPA transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:46:00">[13:46:00]</a>. SWIFT transfers are also cheaper than Binance for USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

Coinbase Pro often has lower withdrawal fees than Binance for bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

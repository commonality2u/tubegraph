[[video_compression]] is a process used to reduce the size of video files while [[retaining_video_quality | retaining video quality]] as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is useful for transferring files via services like [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] or email, and for saving storage space on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Tool Used: VLC Media Player

To compress video files, the tutorial utilizes VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. VLC is a program designed to open and play video files, and it also offers editing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_video_compression_tutorial | Step-by-Step Video Compression Tutorial]]

This guide demonstrates how to compress a video file using VLC Media Player without significant loss of quality or sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Initial File Example

As an example, a chapter from the series "Dark" in HD (1980 resolution) was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This high-quality chapter initially occupied 1.93 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:06">[01:05:06]</a>.

### Compression Process

1.  **Open with VLC**: Open the video file with VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>.
2.  **Access Conversion Menu**:
    *   Navigate to "Media" in the top-left menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
    *   Select "Convert / Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
3.  **Add Video File**: In the new window, click "Add" and select the video file you wish to compress (e.g., chapter one of Dark) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
4.  **Start Conversion**: Click the "Convert / Save" button at the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
5.  **Configure Settings**: This is a crucial step for [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining video quality while compressing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Profile**: Ensure the selected profile is "Video - H.264 + MP3 (MP4)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
    *   **Settings (Tools Icon)**: Click the "Tools" (wrench) icon next to the profile dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
        *   **Encapsulation**: Set to "MP4/MOV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
        *   **Video Codec**:
            *   **Codec**: H.264 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
            *   **Bitrate**: "Same as source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
            *   **Resolution**: Crucially, set "Scale" to "1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Filters remain untouched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Height and width should be automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
        *   **Audio Codec**: It is recommended to keep the audio as "Original audio" to prevent loss of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" after configuring these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
6.  **Destination File**: Choose where to save the compressed file and assign it a name (e.g., "compressed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.
7.  **Start Conversion**: Click "Start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. VLC will begin the conversion process, indicated by the playback bar acting as a loading bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. The video will be fully converted once the bar reaches the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Results

After conversion, the example video, initially 1.93 GB, was reduced to 384 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This represents a reduction of almost 150% of the original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The compressed video retained good quality and sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

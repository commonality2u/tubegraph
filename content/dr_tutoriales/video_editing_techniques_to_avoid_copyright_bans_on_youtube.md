This tutorial outlines specific video editing techniques using [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora]] to help content creators [[uploading_anime_clips_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | upload fragments of series, chapters, films, or anime]] to YouTube without encountering copyright bans or blocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. YouTube can ban or block videos, preventing public visibility, if it detects copied audio (music, voices) or images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. While some videos might be monetized despite copyright, many can be completely blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Preparation with [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora]]

The primary tool for these [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_copyright_detection | strategies]] is [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora]], a video editing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The specific version used in this demonstration is [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora 9]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The following techniques are proven to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, effectively making YouTube unable to [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_copyright_detection | track copyright]] via images or audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Visual Modifications

To alter the visual fingerprint of the video and bypass copyright detection:

*   **Add a Channel Logo**: Always place your channel's logo on the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This logo, along with any associated text, should remain visible throughout the entire duration of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This constant presence helps to "retouch" the video and its images, making it appear modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Apply Effects**: Utilize effects available within [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora]]. An example provided is a "leak of light" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Add a Border**: Implement an "edge of the edge" or border effect around the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This can be customized, for instance, with a blue bottom and white top to create a blurred effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The color and size of this border can be edited to personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Keeping the video on the screen with a complete border and logo is an effective technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Audio Modifications

Modifying the audio is crucial to avoid detection:

*   **Adjust Original Volume**: When a video is imported into [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora 9]], it retains its default sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To bypass copyright detection, reduce the original video's volume to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This prevents YouTube from detecting the original audio peaks and flagging the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The audience can then adjust their volume on YouTube if they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Exporting and [[Uploading anime clips to YouTube without copyright issues | Uploading]]

Once the video has been edited with these modifications, it is ready for export and [[Uploading anime clips to YouTube without copyright issues | upload]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

*   **Export**: Export the video from [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | Filmora]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **[[Uploading anime clips to YouTube without copyright issues | Upload to YouTube]]**: Navigate to [[YouTube Studio video management | YouTube Studio]] and select "Upload videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Choose the exported video file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

After processing, YouTube should indicate "no restrictions" on the video's [[Visibility and copyright considerations on YouTube | visibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This confirms that the editing [[effects_and_modifications_to_bypass_copyright_tracking | techniques]] successfully bypassed YouTube's copyright detection system, allowing the video to be publicly visible without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Identifying the Cryptocurrency to Withdraw

The first step is to open your cryptocurrency wallet application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Once opened, you need to identify which cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The example uses BNB (Binance Coin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Before [[best_practices_for_withdrawing_cryptocurrencies_to_bank_accounts | withdrawing to a bank account]], you must first [[transferring_and_managing_cryptocurrency_assets | transfer your cryptocurrency]] from your wallet (e.g., Trust Wallet) to a conventional exchange that supports fiat withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Examples of such exchanges include Binance, KuCoin, Coinbase, and Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The process described is for [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | transferring to Binance]].

### Steps for Transferring from Wallet to Exchange (e.g., Binance)

1.  **Open Wallet Application**: Access your cryptocurrency wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Send**: Select the "Send" option for the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  **Specify Amount**: Enter the amount you want to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. In the example, $56 of BNB is sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
4.  **Open Exchange Application**: Simultaneously, open your chosen exchange's app (e.g., Binance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
5.  **Initiate Deposit**: On the exchange, select "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
6.  **Choose Cryptocurrency**: Select the cryptocurrency you are depositing (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
7.  **Select Blockchain**: Choose the correct blockchain network (e.g., Byconchain for BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
8.  **Copy Wallet Address and Memo**: Copy the provided wallet address and memo (if applicable) from the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
9.  **Paste into Wallet**: Paste the copied wallet address and memo into the corresponding fields in your wallet application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
10. **Review and Confirm**: Proceed to the next step, review the transaction details, including any commissions (e.g., two cents for the transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, and confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Your capital should now be removed from your wallet and will appear in your exchange's spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency

Once your cryptocurrency has arrived on the exchange, you need to convert it into the desired fiat currency (e.g., Euro) before you can withdraw it to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Trade Section**: On Binance, go to the "Trade" section, which is typically found in the bottom menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
2.  **Use Convert Function**: Select the "Convert" option, usually located at the top left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
3.  **Select Currencies**: Choose the cryptocurrency you hold (e.g., BNB) and the fiat currency you want to convert it to (e.g., USDT then Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The goal is to convert the crypto to Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

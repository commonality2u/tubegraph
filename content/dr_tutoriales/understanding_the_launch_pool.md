The Launch Pool is a financial product available on Binance (referred to as "pages" in the transcript) that allows users to generate new cryptocurrencies by utilizing existing ones as a reference [03:15:16].

## How to Access
While this article focuses on the Launch Pool itself, it's mentioned that it is part of the broader suite of products offered on Binance, which include [[explanation_of_flexible_and_locked_staking_options | flexible and fixed terms]] for crypto investments [01:37:38].

## Profitability and Rewards
Through the Launch Pool, users can stake their BNB currency to obtain rewards in other cryptocurrencies [03:33:35]. Examples of cryptocurrencies that can be obtained include "everything" and "lit entry" [03:22:23]. The annual return rates mentioned for these specific cryptocurrencies are 5% and 3.76% respectively [03:36:39].

## Launch Pool vs. BNB Vault
A key distinction is made between directly investing in the Launch Pool and investing in the BNB Vault:

*   **Investing directly in the Launch Pool** means users will only obtain the specific crypto coins that the Launch Pool system offers as rewards [04:30:32].
*   **Investing in the BNB Vault**, however, offers a dual benefit: users receive rewards from the Launch Pool *and* additional rewards from savings (specifically, BNB cryptocurrency rewards) [04:16:16].
    *   This means that by investing BNB into the BNB Vault, users gain more overall crypto coins and benefits compared to direct Launch Pool participation [04:41:43].
    *   The BNB Vault automatically incorporates available Launch Pool projects to maximize returns [03:09:10].

Investing BNB in the BNB Vault is highly recommended for its flexibility and the potential for greater and more varied rewards [05:22:22]. It offers flexible savings, meaning users can withdraw their funds whenever they wish, as it is not subject to locked staking terms [05:26:28].

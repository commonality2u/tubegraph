## [[different_types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_uses | Types of Payoneer Accounts]]

There are two primary account types within Payoneer:
*   **Individual (or Private) Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>
*   **Company Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>

It is crucial to understand that transfers to a company account on Payoneer must originate from another company account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Personal bank transfers to a company Payoneer account are not permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## [[managing_currencies_and_transactions_with_payoneer | Managing Currencies and Receiving Accounts]]

Payoneer supports multiple currencies, such as dollars, euros, and British pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Each currency is associated with an automatically opened bank account within the Payoneer platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. For example, accounts are available for the Eurozone, United Kingdom, and United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Users can view bank account details, such as those with Banking Circle, and copy the data to facilitate transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

Additional currency accounts can be requested through the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. By default, new accounts typically open with British pounds and dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>, but euros can also be added upon request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. These bank accounts are used to [[requesting_and_using_a_payoneer_card | request payments]] from customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

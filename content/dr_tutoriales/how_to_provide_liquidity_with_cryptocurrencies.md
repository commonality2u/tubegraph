Providing liquidity on platforms like [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] through features like Liquid Swap or Liquid Pool allows users to invest their cryptocurrencies and other financial assets to earn profits [00:00:05]. This tutorial explains how to use this financial product from scratch [00:00:15].

## Accessing Liquid Swap on Binance

To access the Liquid Swap feature on [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]], navigate to the "Finance" section of the platform [00:01:15]. Within this section, locate the option labeled "Become a provider of liquidity and double your Profits" [00:01:24].

## Understanding Liquidity Provision

Providing liquidity involves contributing your cryptocurrencies or other assets (such as Euros or Dollars) to the platform [00:01:41]. These assets then provide the necessary liquidity for other users to buy, convert, exchange, or sell those coins [00:01:49]. In return, you earn a share of the commissions generated from these transactions [00:01:52]. Your profitability is directly based on the volume of transactions carried out with the coins you contribute [00:02:05].

### Returns and APY

The returns offered by providing liquidity are often displayed as an Annual Percentage Yield (APY) [00:02:22]. This APY indicates the profitability you can expect over seven days [00:02:25]. It's crucial to understand that these values are not fixed and fluctuate significantly based on the transaction volume of the underlying cryptocurrencies [00:02:31].

### Cryptocurrency Selection

When using this product, it is recommended to choose cryptocurrencies that have a high trading volume [00:02:43]. This approach helps reduce risk and potentially ensures more stable returns [00:02:47].

### Liquidity Options: Stable vs. Innovative

[[different_liquidity_options_stable_vs_innovative | Binance]] offers two main types of liquidity:
*   **[[different_liquidity_options_stable_vs_innovative | Stable Liquidity]]** These products generally have profitability that does not vary much [00:02:56].
*   **[[different_liquidity_options_stable_vs_innovative | Innovative Liquidity]]** The profitability of these products tends to vary more [00:03:00].

## Adding Liquidity

To add liquidity, you can select the desired cryptocurrency pair [00:03:10]. For example, you might add Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance USD (BUSD) [00:03:13].

*   **Adding Two Currencies:** If you add both currencies in a pair (e.g., BTC and BUSD), [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] will typically not charge a commission for adding this liquidity [00:03:31].
*   **Adding a Single Currency:** If you add only one of the currencies (e.g., just BTC or just BUSD), you will be charged a commission, which will reduce your overall profitability [00:03:41].

Before proceeding, it is recommended to read the terms and conditions [00:03:58].

## Risks of Providing Liquidity (Impermanent Loss)

It is crucial to understand that profitability is **not always guaranteed** when providing liquidity [00:04:22]. There is a risk of experiencing negative values, also known as impermanent loss [00:04:33].

This can occur if the price of the cryptocurrencies you have contributed depreciates significantly after your initial transaction [00:04:42]. If the decrease in the value of your contributed currencies outweighs the commissions earned from transactions, your overall profitability will be negative [00:04:53]. The value of your coins can drop faster than the commissions you collect from transactions [00:05:09].

## Managing Your Liquidity

You can add or withdraw liquidity at any time [00:05:27].

To withdraw your participation:
1.  Go to the "Withdraw" section [00:05:30].
2.  Select the liquidity you wish to remove, such as Bitcoin (BTC) and Binance USD (BUSD) [00:05:33].

You can also view your participation history by navigating to "My Participation" [00:05:45]. This section shows:
*   The amount you have contributed [00:05:48].
*   Your total yield percentage [00:05:53].
*   Daily profitability [00:05:57].
*   A history of when you added or withdrew liquidity [00:06:21].

While withdrawing your money may incur percentage-based commissions [00:06:52], the primary goal of providing liquidity is to keep your funds deposited for a relatively medium to long-term period [00:07:01]. This allows other users to continuously transact with your money, maximizing your potential for profitability [00:07:08].

When withdrawing capital from cryptocurrency exchanges to a bank account, it is crucial to use a compatible bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Not all traditional bank accounts accept withdrawals from centralized cryptocurrency exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Issues with Conventional Banks

Conventional banks, such as Santander or BBVA, often do not permit withdrawals from centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. In many cases, these transactions may be blocked by the bank, causing the funds to be returned to the centralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Recommended Solution: Neobanks

To ensure successful transactions, it is highly recommended to use neobanks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. These digital banks are designed to handle transactions with cryptocurrency exchanges more smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

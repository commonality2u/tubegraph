[[uploading_files_to_mega | Mega]] is a web service primarily used for downloading and uploading content, allowing users to share and transfer files with others [00:00:17]. It is commonly utilized for sharing various types of content, such as series, movies, and documents [00:00:31].

## Creating a Mega Account
To get started with Mega, the first step is to create an account [00:00:36]. This process is straightforward, requiring only an email address [00:00:45]. After entering your email, you will receive a confirmation email to finalize the account setup [00:00:50].

### [[understanding_mega_storage_plans | Understanding Mega Storage Plans]]
Upon account creation, Mega offers various plans for use [00:00:57]. The free plan provides up to 50 gigabytes (GB) of storage [00:01:08]. While this amount is considered "quite little" [00:01:13], it is sufficient for storing small or relatively small files [00:01:17]. For users requiring more space, paid options such as Lite and Pro accounts are available [00:01:33]. This guide focuses on working with the default free account [00:01:41].

## Optimizing Storage with File Compression
Given the 50 GB storage limit on free accounts [00:01:50], [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | optimizing storage]] by compressing files is crucial [00:01:25].

### [[compressing_files_using_winrar | Compressing Files using WinRAR]]
To compress files, the [[downloading_and_installing_winrar | WinRAR]] program is necessary [00:02:47]. WinRAR is designed specifically for file compression [00:02:49].

To compress a file or folder:
1.  Right-click on the desired file or folder [00:02:53].
2.  Select "Add file..." [00:02:56].
3.  In the WinRAR interface (represented by a logo of books) [00:02:57]:
    *   Ensure the file format is set to "RAR" [00:03:03].
    *   Set the compression method to "best" for maximum compression [00:03:04].
    *   Select the option to "create a solid file" [00:03:09].
4.  Click "Accept" to begin the compression process [00:03:15].

> [!EXAMPLE]
> An example folder named "La Casa de Papel," initially weighing 2.21 GB [00:02:27], when compressed using WinRAR, resulted in a file size of 13.1 GB [00:03:46]. The speaker states that this compression technique saved approximately 8-9 GB [00:03:54].
> *Please note: The numerical values provided in the transcript suggest the compressed file (13.1 GB) was significantly larger than the original (2.21 GB). However, the narrator states this compression was "pretty good" and saved "around eight gigabytes, nine gigabytes" [00:03:51].*

### [[checking_compressed_file_size | Checking Compressed File Size]]
After compression, the new `.rar` file can be opened to verify that the original files are contained within [00:03:33]. To check the size of the compressed file, right-click on it and go to "properties" [00:03:42].

## [[uploading_files_to_mega | Uploading to Mega]]
Once files are compressed, they can be uploaded to your Mega account [00:04:03].
1.  Navigate to the cloud symbol in the Mega interface [00:02:04].
2.  Select "Upload file" [00:04:07].
3.  Choose the compressed `.rar` file you wish to upload [00:04:14].
4.  The upload process will begin [00:04:18].

## [[sharing_and_managing_mega_download_links | Sharing Files on Mega]]
After a file has been successfully uploaded to the Mega cloud, it can be shared with others [00:04:24].
1.  Locate the uploaded file in your Mega account [00:04:52].
2.  Right-click on the file [00:04:58].
3.  Select the "Manage link" option [00:05:04].
4.  The generated link includes an encryption key [00:05:09]. This link can be shared, allowing anyone with the link to access the content [00:05:11].
5.  To provide the encryption key separately, click on "cipher key," copy the displayed key, and share it along with the link [00:05:22]. Entering this key allows recipients to download the content [00:05:31].

MEGA is a web page used for sharing and downloading content, such as series, movies, or documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. One person uploads content, and another downloads it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Creating a MEGA Account
To create a MEGA account, you simply need to enter an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A confirmation email will be sent, which you then use to confirm and create the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Account Plans
After creating the account, MEGA offers various plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The free plan provides up to fifty gigabytes of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While this is considered "quite little," it can be sufficient for storing small or relatively small files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Paid options like Lite and Pro accounts are also available for those who need more storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This guide focuses on working with the default free account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Optimizing Storage with File Compression
The 50 GB free storage limit can be quickly consumed by large files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. For example, a single folder containing episodes of a series like "La Casa de Papel" can weigh 2.21 gigabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Uploading multiple such files would quickly exhaust the available storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. To optimize storage, files can be compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### [[how_to_compress_files_with_winrar | Compressing with WinRAR]]
[[downloading_and_installing_winrar | WinRAR]] is a program designed for compressing files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

To [[setting_up_file_compression_with_winrar | compress a file]] using WinRAR:
1.  Right-click on the file or folder you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  Click "Add file" (identified by the WinRAR logo of little books) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
3.  In the WinRAR options, set the file format to "RAR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
4.  Set the compression method to "Better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
5.  Select the option to "Create a solid file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
6.  Click "Accept" to start the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

After compression, the file will be significantly smaller. For instance, a "La Casa de Papel" folder that originally contained files totaling much more, once compressed, could be reduced to 13.1 gigabytes, saving around eight or nine gigabytes of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. You can open the compressed file to verify its contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## [[uploading_files_to_mega | Uploading and Sharing Files on MEGA]]
Once your file is compressed, you can [[using_mega_for_file_sharing | upload it to MEGA]]:
1.  Navigate to the cloud symbol in your MEGA account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
2.  Select "Upload file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
3.  Choose the compressed `.rar` file (e.g., "La Casa de Papel" file) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
4.  Open it to begin the upload process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Once the file is uploaded to the MEGA cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:
1.  Right-click on the uploaded `.rar` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Manage link" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
3.  The displayed link is the "link with key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
4.  To get the key, click on "cipher key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
5.  Copy this key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

You can then share the link and its corresponding key with others, allowing them to access and download the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

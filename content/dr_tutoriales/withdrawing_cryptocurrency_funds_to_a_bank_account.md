This guide explains [[understanding_cryptocurrency_withdrawal_processes | how to withdraw money]] from your cryptocurrency account to your bank account, covering the steps to convert Bitcoin or other cryptocurrencies to national currency and then transfer it to your bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. It's important to note that withdrawing profits will require a benefit statement and tax declaration in your country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Converting Bitcoin to Fiat Currency

Assuming you have Bitcoin in your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, the first step to [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing funds]] is to convert it to your national currency, such as euros or dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

While it is often recommended to convert Bitcoin to other cryptocurrencies to potentially make more profits due to fiat currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, withdrawing capital necessitates converting to your national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Steps to Convert Bitcoin to Fiat:
1.  Navigate to a relevant market, such as BTC/Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
2.  Select the "sell Bitcoin" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  Choose the desired amount to sell. You can enter a specific number, or select the total maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
4.  Confirm the sale. The equivalent amount in euros (or your chosen fiat currency) will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

It's important to note that there might be a minimum selling amount, such as 10 euros for certain transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Orders can be placed as a limit order or directly to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Converting Other Cryptocurrencies to Fiat

Some cryptocurrencies cannot be directly converted to euros or other fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. In such cases, a two-step process is required:
1.  First, convert the cryptocurrency to Bitcoin or a stablecoin like Dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
2.  Then, convert the Bitcoin (or stablecoin) to your national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
This method ensures that any cryptocurrency can eventually be converted to your desired fiat currency using Bitcoin as an intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This process applies to [[cryptocurrency_selection_for_withdrawal | cryptocurrency selection for withdrawal]] when direct conversion is not available.

## Withdrawing Fiat Currency to Your Bank Account

Once your cryptocurrency is converted to your national currency (e.g., euros), you can initiate a withdrawal to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Steps to Withdraw Funds:
1.  Navigate to your wallet section, specifically the "spot wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
2.  Select the "withdraw" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
3.  Choose your currency (e.g., Euro) and the payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   **Bank Transfer:** Recommended for lower commissions (e.g., 0.8) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   **Bank Card:** May have higher commissions, though faster (up to 30 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
5.  Input your bank account details, such as IBAN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
6.  Confirm the transaction.
7.  Funds are typically deposited into your bank account within one to two business days via bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Withdrawal Limits and Fees:
*   **Bank Transfer:** Minimum withdrawal can be as low as 3 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, with a maximum of 50,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Commissions are generally lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Bank Card:** Minimum withdrawal can be 10 euros, and maximum up to 5,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. While faster, this method charges higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Choosing bank transfer, despite the longer processing time, is often recommended to save on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

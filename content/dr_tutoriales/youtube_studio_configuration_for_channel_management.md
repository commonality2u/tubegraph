[[youtube_studio_configuration_for_new_accounts | YouTube Studio]] provides various configuration options for managing a YouTube channel's features and permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Accessing Configuration Settings

To access the channel management settings, navigate to the [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_new_accounts | YouTube Studio]] section of your channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Once there, select the "configuration" option, which typically appears on the left side menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Within "configuration," you can find "permissions" or "channel permissions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Channel Verification and Features

Certain channel features are not enabled unless the channel is verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. [[youtube_channel_verification_process | Verification]] is typically simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Types of Verification and Requirements

*   **Phone Number Verification**: This verification is necessary to enable:
    *   [[youtube_studio_features_for_enabling_long_video_uploads | Video uploads]] longer than fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>
    *   Custom thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
    *   [[creating_playlists_and_video_collaborations_on_youtube | Live broadcasts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
    *   More frequent [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | video uploads]] per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   More [[creating_playlists_and_video_collaborations_on_youtube | live streams]] per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
    *   Ability to [[creating_playlists_and_video_collaborations_on_youtube | create sorts]] (shorts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>
*   **Identity Verification**: For more advanced features and monetization, a valid identity document or [[youtube_channel_verification_process | video verification]] may be required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This also involves the channel history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Verification for Tick Mark**: To receive the verified tick mark on a channel, approximately 100,000 subscribers are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Benefits of Verification

[[youtube_channel_verification_process | Verifying]] a channel enables access to features crucial for channel growth and [[content_editing_and_video_management_on_youtube | video management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Without verification, functionalities like [[youtube_studio_features_for_enabling_long_video_uploads | long video uploads]] and custom thumbnails are unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Monetization also requires channel verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

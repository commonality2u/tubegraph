Transcribing YouTube videos to text is a straightforward process when utilizing browser extensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This article details how to use a specific Google Chrome extension to convert YouTube video content into text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Glass Chrome Extension

The process described uses a [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | Google Chrome extension]] called "Glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This extension leverages Chat GPT to perform the conversion of YouTube video content to text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Installation and Usage

To use the Glass extension, follow these steps:
1.  **Install the Extension** The Glass extension needs to be installed on your [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | Chrome browser]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  **Open YouTube** Navigate to the YouTube platform in a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  **Select a Video** Choose any video you wish to transcribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  **Access Transcript** Once the extension is installed, a small window labeled "transcript and summery" will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Clicking on this window will reveal the video's transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Transcript Features and Copying

The transcript provided by the Glass extension presents the video's dialogue in paragraphs, with each segment corresponding to specific seconds or sequences within the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This provides a full transcription of everything spoken in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

To copy the transcript:
*   You can manually select the text and copy it to a document like Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Alternatively, the extension offers a "Copy as text" option for direct copying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The copied text can then be pasted wherever needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

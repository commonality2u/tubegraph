This guide outlines the process to [[activating_bluetooth_in_windows_10 | activate Bluetooth]] on a Windows 10 computer and demonstrate its functionality, which can resolve common connection issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Activating Bluetooth on Windows 10

To ensure Bluetooth is properly configured and running on your Windows 10 system, follow these steps:

### 1. Accessing Services
Begin by navigating to the home bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. In the search bar, type "services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> and open the "Services" window that appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### 2. Configuring Bluetooth Compatibility Service
Within the "Services" window, locate the "Bluetooth compatibility" service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This service is listed alphabetically, under 'S' as "Service of Bluetooth compatibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### 3. Adjusting Service Properties
Once found, right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
Set the "Startup type" to "Automatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### 4. Restarting the Bluetooth Service
After applying the changes, right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
Select "Restart" to reset the implemented changes on your computer's Bluetooth system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Confirm the restart when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### 5. Accessing Bluetooth Settings
Close the "Services" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Return to the taskbar and search for "Bluetooth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Open "Bluetooth settings and other devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### 6. Enabling Bluetooth Icon in Notification Area
Within "Bluetooth settings and other devices," look for "More Bluetooth options" on the right side of the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
Ensure that the checkbox "Show the Bluetooth icon in the notification area" is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This step ensures the Bluetooth symbol is visible, confirming that Bluetooth is enabled on the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Demonstrating Bluetooth Connectivity

To [[demonstrating_bluetooth_file_transfer | demonstrate Bluetooth file transfer]] and confirm your setup works, you can connect a mobile device:

1.  Return to "Bluetooth and other devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
2.  Click on "Add Bluetooth or other devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
3.  Search for the desired mobile device, such as an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
4.  Select your device (e.g., iPhone) when it appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  On your mobile phone, accept the connection request from the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Once linked, the device will be ready to communicate and transmit data between your computer and mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

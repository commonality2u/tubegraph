When [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | compressing videos for WhatsApp]], it's essential to understand the available options and how they affect the final output, as WhatsApp has a capacity limit for sending videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Choosing a [[video_compression_tools_available_in_app_stores | Video Compression Tool]]

To begin, you will need to download a [[video_compression | video compression]] application from your device's app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When searching for "video compressor", you will find a list of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

While many of these applications are quite useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, a recommended choice is one that offers the least advertising and has minimal payment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Understanding Compression Settings

Once you've selected and opened a video compression app, you'll typically be given the option to compress a video from your gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The application will present "indices of compression," which indicate how much you want to compress the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

For example, selecting 85% means the video will be compressed to 85% of its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. A lower percentage setting will result in greater compression, meaning a smaller file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For instance, a 34.6 megabyte video compressed at 85% might reduce to 29.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The goal is to reduce the video's size while [[retaining_video_quality | maintaining quality limits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. A common approach is to set the compression to around 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This can result in a significant size reduction, such as 10 megabytes, while generally preserving good quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Compression Modes

Many apps offer different modes for [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | video compression]]:

*   **Normal Mode:** This mode automatically reduces the video's bitrates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Advanced Mode:** This mode allows for manual adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

The objective is to reduce the video's size enough for WhatsApp without sacrificing too much quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> After compression, the video will be saved in your device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The compression process usually takes between 20 to 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

[[introduction_to_revolut_app | Revolut]] offers various features to help users manage their money, save for specific goals, and explore investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

## Managing Expenses and Financial Goals
[[managing_finances_with_revolut | Revolut]] allows users to [[managing_finances_with_revolut | manage their money]] through expense analysis, categorizing spending by types like transportation, restaurants, or shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This feature helps users understand their spending habits and [[managing_finances_with_revolut | control expenses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### Personal Vaults for Savings
Revolut includes a feature called "Personal Vaults" (referred to as "personal bulls" or "trunks" in the transcript), which enables users to set specific financial objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. For example, a user can create a "travel trunk to Mexico" with a target amount and contribute money monthly until the goal is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. This promotes a more controlled way of [[managing_finances_with_revolut | saving]] and [[managing_finances_with_revolut | efficient money management]] to achieve set goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities
[[investing_and_trading_with_revolut | Revolut]] provides options for [[investing_and_trading_with_revolut | purchasing cryptocurrencies and gold]] directly within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. While the platform mentions "investments in the stock market without commissions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>, it's noted that this is "relative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>.

### Interest on Savings
Certain [[revolut_card_features | Revolut plans]], such as Metal and Plus, offer interest on savings. The Metal plan offers up to 0.65% annual interest, paid daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. The Plus plan allows for interest earnings on savings accounts, potentially up to 40% annual interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. Users should consider the different [[benefits_of_flexible_vs_locked_savings | Revolut plans]] and their financial situations when deciding if it's worth upgrading for these benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

## Account Plans and Benefits
[[revolut_card_features | Revolut]] offers different account plans, including Standard (free), Plus, Premium, and Metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. These plans come with varying benefits related to savings and other features:

*   **Standard Plan**: Offers the simplest features, including one free international transfer per month, with subsequent transfers costing 0.50 pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>.
*   **Premium Plan**: Provides additional benefits like double withdrawals at ATMs (400 pounds per month) compared to the Standard plan, and unlimited international transfers without commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Metal Plan**: The most comprehensive plan, offering benefits such as cashback (0.01% within Europe and 1% outside Europe), free international transfers without commissions, and extensive travel coverage and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. This plan is particularly useful for those who travel frequently due to its coverage and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

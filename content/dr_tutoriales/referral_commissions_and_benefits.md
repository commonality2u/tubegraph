The Pods (likely [[binance_referral_program | Binance]]) referral program allows users to earn commissions by inviting friends to create accounts and engage in trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This system is designed to provide benefits to both the referrer and the referred individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## How the Referral Program Works

The fundamental principle of the referral program is that when someone opens an account using your unique referral link, they receive a discount on their commissions, and you, as the referrer, receive a portion of those commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Commissions are generated whenever referred users complete deposits, transactions, or withdrawals within their Pods account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

It is recommended to use referral links with people who are known to make investments or use their money to invest cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Benefits and Commission Structure

### Benefits for the Referred User
Users who sign up using a referral link can receive a 10% discount on commissions whenever they perform deposits, operations, or withdrawals within their Pods account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Benefits for the Referrer
Referrers can earn up to 40% commission each time their invited friends conduct trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The exact percentage received depends on the referral link's configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

Commissions earned are typically received in the same cryptocurrency that the referred user bought or traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For example, if a referred person buys BNB, the referrer will receive commissions in BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Commission Percentages
Users can generate different referral links with varying commission splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Standard Split:** A common split is 10% for the referrer and 10% for the referred friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **Referrer-Favored:** Another option allows the referrer to receive 20% commission while the referred person receives 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Higher Tiers:** If an account's balance is higher than 500 BNB, users may be able to choose options like 15% or 20% for themselves and 0% for the referred party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

> [!TIP] Ethical Practice
> It is considered ethical to create links that provide benefits to both parties, such as the 10% for both the referrer and the referred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Managing and Tracking Referrals

### Accessing the Referral Program

### Referral Dashboard
The referral dashboard provides a comprehensive overview of your referral activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
*   **Control Panel:** Shows earned bitcoins (representing the value of earned commissions) and total transactions made by referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Link List:** Displays all generated referral links and their respective commission splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Friends List:** Shows the list of friends who have opened accounts using your referral links, including their user IDs, account types (e.g., spot, mining, futures), and registration times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. User privacy is maintained, as full names are not revealed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Commission History:** Provides a detailed history of commissions earned based on different account types (spot, futures, mining) and the specific cryptocurrencies in which commissions were paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Shared Commissions:** Details the commissions shared with referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Generating New Links
New referral links can be generated, allowing you to choose the percentage split between yourself and the referred user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Options typically include 0%, 5%, or 10% for the referred user, with the remainder going to the referrer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

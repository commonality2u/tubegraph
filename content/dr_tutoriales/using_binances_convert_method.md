Binance offers an intuitive method to convert cryptocurrencies, known as the "Convert Method" or "Method 1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This method is designed for ease of use and simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## How to Use the Convert Method

To utilize the Convert Method on Binance:
1.  Navigate to the "Trading" tab at the top of the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  Select the "Convert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to convert from, for example, USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  Select the target cryptocurrency you want to convert to, such as BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
5.  Enter the amount you wish to convert (e.g., "maximum") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
6.  Click "Preview Conversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
7.  A confirmation prompt will appear, showing the current price and a countdown timer (e.g., five seconds) to confirm the conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This short window is due to cryptocurrency volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
8.  Confirm the conversion within the given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

After conversion, you can view the status of your conversions within your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Limitations of the Convert Method

*   **Availability**: This method only allows conversion between cryptocurrencies that are explicitly available within the Convert interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. If your desired target cryptocurrency is not listed, you cannot use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, converting directly from USDT to Polkadot may not be an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Minimum Quantity**: There is a minimum quantity required for each conversion. If your amount is below this minimum, the conversion cannot proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Commissions and Fees

Binance states that it does not charge a commission for Over-the-Counter (OTC) operations like those performed through the Convert Method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, there might be a "spread" applied, meaning prices could vary slightly from current market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. There is no direct commission associated with converting cryptocurrencies using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. This absence of commission can contribute to [[methods_to_reduce_binance_commissions | reducing overall costs]] on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

For converting cryptocurrencies that are not available through the Convert Method, other [[methods_to_convert_cryptocurrencies | methods to convert cryptocurrencies]] on Binance, such as using the market trading interface, may be necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

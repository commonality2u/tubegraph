## Buying BNB on PC

### Navigating to BNB Markets
To buy BNB, first go to the "markets" section on the [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Within the markets, you'll need to search for the BNB cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Navigate to the "zones" section, select "everything," and then find BNB, which typically appears as the fourth cryptocurrency by capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

Clicking "operate" on BNB will open a new tab displaying a graph of BNB compared to USD (USDT), which is a cryptocurrency that mimics the value of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. You can select other exchange pairs, such as BNB/Euro, by clicking the downward arrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### Placing a Market Order
In the "place order" section, you'll see options to buy or [[how_to_sell_bitcoin_on_binance | sell]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Different order types are available, including:
*   [[limit_orders_explained | Limit order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>
*   [[market_orders_in_trading | Market order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>
*   [[stop_market_orders | Stop order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   [[cryptocurrency_market_orders_vs_limit_orders | Order or]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>

To buy instantly at the current price, choose the [[market_orders_in_trading | market order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This means your purchase will be executed immediately, in real-time, at the moment you confirm the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

You can specify either:
*   The desired amount of BNB to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   The total amount in euros (or your chosen currency) you wish to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
For example, to buy 1,000 euros worth of BNB, you would input "1000" and click "buy," and the BNB would then appear in your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

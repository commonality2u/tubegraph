Activating comments on YouTube videos is crucial for promoting your content and fostering viewer interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Increased engagement through comments helps position your videos more favorably within YouTube's algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Even negative comments contribute to interaction, which can benefit video positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Deactivated Comments Example

Before activating comments, it's possible to see that they are deactivated on a video, indicating that viewers cannot post or read comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Three Key Considerations for Activating Comments

To reactivate comments, three important considerations must be taken into account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These settings are managed within [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### 1. Channel-Level Setting: Audience

The first step is to navigate to the "Configuration" (settings) section of your channel within [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   Go to "Channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   Access "Advanced settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Ensure that your channel is marked as "No, set this channel as not made for kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   **Important**: If a channel is designated as "created for children," comments will be universally banned across all its videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Marking it as "no" allows comments to be readable across all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### 2. Video-Specific Setting: Audience

The second consideration involves the individual video settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

*   Within [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]], select the specific video you wish to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Click on "Details" for that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Similar to the channel setting, you must specify whether the video is "content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   If you mark the video as "yes, it is content created for children," YouTube will automatically block all comments for that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. Therefore, select "No, it is not content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### 3. Video-Specific Setting: Comment Permissions

The third and final consideration is to explicitly allow comments within the video's detailed settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

*   Under the video's "Details," scroll down to "More options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Locate the "Comments and ratings" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   To enable interaction, select "Allow all comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Options may include disabling comments or holding potentially inappropriate comments for review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Choosing "Allow all comments" ensures viewers can interact freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Managing Inappropriate Comments

Even after allowing all comments, a content creator can manage them later. Notifications are received for comments, and those deemed inappropriate, out of place, or disrespectful may be deleted to maintain the video's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

It is essential to consider all three mentioned steps to successfully activate comments on your YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

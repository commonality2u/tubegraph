Payoneer provides a platform for managing finances, offering various features for individuals and businesses alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The platform is accessible via computer or a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Payoneer Interface and Support
The Payoneer platform features an interactive menu on the left side, displaying sections like "beginning part," "receiving," "paying," "withdrawing," "transfers," "Account," "Banks & Cards," and "Network of business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Users can find their user ID (number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, access notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and reach customer support directly from the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Payoneer offers support in multiple languages, including Spanish and English, serving regions like Spain, Latin America, and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Profile settings, including name configuration and verification, are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## [[types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_differences | Types of Payoneer Accounts]]
Within Payoneer, there are two primary account types:
*   **Individual/Private Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   **Company Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>

### Transfer Compatibility
A critical distinction between these account types is how transfers are processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
*   Transfers into a company Payoneer account must originate from another company account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Conversely, transfers from an individual bank account cannot be made to a company Payoneer account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Managing Currencies
Payoneer supports transactions in various currencies, such as US Dollars, Euros, and British Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Receiving Accounts
The "Banks & Cards" section is where users can manage their receiving accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For each currency, Payoneer automatically opens a corresponding bank account, such as those in the Eurozone, United Kingdom, and United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Users can view and copy the details of these bank accounts (e.g., Banking Circle) for initiating transfers from other external accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Users can also request additional receiving accounts in different currencies if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. By default, new accounts typically open with support for British Pounds and US Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. These bank accounts are essential for [[types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_differences | requesting payments]] from clients or customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

### Currency Conversion
Under the "Withdrawal and Transfer" menu, the "Manage currencies" option allows users to convert funds from one currency to another, for example, exchanging Euros for Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. A commission is applied to these currency exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Account Activity and Reporting
The "Account Activity" section provides an overview of transactions and payment requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Users can also download monthly statements, which are useful for tax declaration in their respective countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## [[payoneer_card_application_and_usage | Payoneer Card]]
Users can [[payoneer_card_application_and_usage | apply for a Payoneer card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Eligibility requires having received payments of at least $100 within the last six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Commissions
Commissions on the Payoneer platform vary depending on the type of transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It is recommended to review the specific commission rates for different operations as they can impact the cost-effectiveness of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

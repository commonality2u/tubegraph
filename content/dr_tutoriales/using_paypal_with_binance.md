Binance's peer-to-peer (P2P) trading platform allows users to exchange cryptocurrencies directly with other users, often offering more favorable rates than traditional bank exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This method facilitates direct currency exchange between two individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. [[how_to_deposit_money_into_binance | How to deposit money into Binance]] via P2P involves setting a price for the exchange when selling, or accepting a price set by another person when buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Accessing P2P Trading on Binance

To access P2P trading:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section on the Binance website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Select "P2P Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  Within the P2P interface, you will see options to "Buy" and "Sell" cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Selecting Currencies and Amounts

When buying, you can choose the fiat currency you are working with (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. You can also select the cryptocurrency you wish to buy, such as Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The platform displays available offers, including the price and the amount of cryptocurrency offered by other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Using PayPal as a Payment Method

One of the important considerations in P2P transactions is the payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Not all users accept every payment method, as preferences can vary due to country-specific conditions, economic conditions, and other factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

To filter transactions by [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]] as a payment option:
1.  On the P2P page, locate the "Payment" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
2.  Enter "PayPal" as the desired payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  The list of available users will update to show only those willing to use [[benefits_of_using_paypal_for_payments | PayPal]] for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Commonly used payment methods include bank transfers and [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]] transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Important Considerations for P2P Trading

*   **Price and Commission Graphs**: Always take into account the price and commission graphs before making a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. It's crucial to check the current market price of the cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) to ensure the exchange is profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. For example, a Bitcoin might be listed for 36,000 euros on P2P when the market price is 27,000 euros, highlighting the importance of verifying prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Volatility**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are highly volatile, meaning their value can change significantly from one day to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Constant attention to market prices is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **User Rating and Reliability**: It is crucial to check the rating of each user before engaging in a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This includes the number of P2P transactions they have completed and their success rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. After a transaction, you can rate the other user based on speed, ease, and correct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This helps assess the risk of non-payment, which users assume when making these payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. User ratings are visible below their name, showing orders placed and completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Transferring Funds to P2P Wallet

To trade in P2P commerce, you must first transfer the capital you wish to use to your P2P wallet within Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. For example, to transfer Bitcoin:
1.  Go to your "Fiat Spot" wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
2.  Initiate a "Transfer" from your Spot wallet to your P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount you wish to transfer and confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. Once transferred, the funds will appear in your P2P wallet and be available for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

## Completing a P2P Transaction

When initiating a buy or sell order, a pop-up window will appear displaying details such as the maximum and minimum amounts you can trade, the amount you will receive, and the payment methods accepted by the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. The payment limit time for the transfer, typically around 45-55 minutes, indicates the window within which both parties must complete their respective transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. If selling, you will need to introduce your account details for receiving payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

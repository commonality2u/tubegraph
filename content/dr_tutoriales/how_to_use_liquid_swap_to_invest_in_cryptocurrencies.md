This tutorial explains how to use it from scratch to maximize returns within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Accessing Liquid Swap on Binance

To access [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] on the [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] platform, navigate to the "finance" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Scroll down to the "new" section, which promotes becoming a liquidity provider to double your profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Understanding Liquidity Provision

Providing liquidity means contributing your [[sending_receiving_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] or other assets (like euros or dollars) to a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These assets are then used to facilitate transactions (buying, converting, [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | exchanging]], or selling) for other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In return, you earn profitability based on the commissions from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

The returns displayed, such as 7.8044% weekly, are defined as APY (Annual Percentage Yield) over seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. It is crucial to understand that this value is not fixed and depends entirely on the volume of transactions involving the [[sending_receiving_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. It is recommended to use [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] with [[sending_receiving_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] that have a high trading volume to reduce risk and ensure profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Types of Liquidity Pools

There are two main categories of liquidity pools:
*   **Stable Liquidity**: Products in this category offer profitability that does not vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Innovation Liquidity**: These products experience more variability in their profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Adding and Withdrawing Liquidity

You can choose to add or withdraw liquidity from your contributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. For example, when adding liquidity for a pair like Bitcoin (BTC) and BUSD, you have two options:
*   **Add both currencies (e.g., BTC and BUSD)**: This option does not incur any commission for adding liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Add only one currency (e.g., only BTC or only BUSD)**: This option will incur a commission, making it less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

The current pool size for a specific pair, like Bitcoin and BUSD, can be substantial, with an example given of 452.6 Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. It is advisable to read the terms and conditions before using this product, especially if you are new to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## [[understanding_the_risks_and_profitability_of_liquid_swap | Understanding the Risks of Liquid Swap]]

It is crucial to understand that profitability is not guaranteed when providing liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. You may experience negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This happens if the price of the [[sending_receiving_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] you provided drops significantly after your deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. If the depreciation of the assets outweighs the commissions earned from transactions, your overall profitability will be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. The value of your coins can drop faster than the commissions you collect, resulting in a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Monitoring Your Participation

You can view your contributions and earnings by going to "my participation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This section displays:
*   The amount you have contributed (e.g., Bitcoin, BUSD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Your total yield (e.g., 8.7706%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Daily profitability (e.g., 1.04%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   The history of your transactions, including when you added or withdrew liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Withdrawal and Long-Term Strategy

When you withdraw your money from the pool, [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] charges a percentage commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. The ideal strategy for [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] is to leave your funds deposited for a relatively medium to long timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This allows users to conduct transactions with your money, enabling you to earn consistent profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Comparison: Liquid Swap vs. Holding Cryptocurrencies

A key consideration is whether [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] offers more profitability than simply holding a [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | cryptocurrency]] like Bitcoin and hoping for its value to revalue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Liquid Swap**: Provides profitability through transaction commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
*   **Holding Cryptocurrencies**: Profitability depends on the asset's price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

While [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] offers a way to earn passive income, the risk of negative values due to market fluctuations needs to be factored in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

This guide explains how to withdraw capital from MetaMask to a bank account safely and reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The process involves an intermediary centralized exchange, as direct withdrawals from MetaMask to a bank account are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:10">[01:16:10]</a>. The tutorial primarily focuses on using a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>.

## Overview of the Withdrawal Process

The withdrawal process consists of two main stages:
1.  Transferring cryptocurrency from MetaMask to a [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | centralized exchange]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:10">[01:08:10]</a>.
2.  Withdrawing the funds from the [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | centralized exchange]] to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:10]</a>.

## Choosing an Intermediary Centralized Exchange

A [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | centralized exchange]] (CEX) is required as an intermediary. Popular examples include:
*   Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>
*   Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>
*   Q Coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>
*   [[using_kraken_for_usdt_to_usd_conversion | Kraken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>
*   Crypto.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>

The chosen CEX must support SEPA transfers to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>. For this tutorial, Binance is used as the example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. Alternatives like [[using_kraken_for_usdt_to_usd_conversion | Kraken]] or Coinbase are also viable, with [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | Kraken]] and Coinbase potentially offering zero withdrawal fees compared to Binance's €1 fee for bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:10">[01:53:10]</a>.

Referral links for these platforms may offer bonuses, such as a 10-15% discount on [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:10">[02:06:10]</a>.

## Bank Account Requirements

Not all bank accounts accept withdrawals from [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | centralized exchanges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:10">[02:37:10]</a>. Traditional banks like Santander or BBVA may block these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:10">[02:44:10]</a>. It is recommended to use "neobanks" like Revolut or N26, which are designed to facilitate transactions with such exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:10">[02:57:10]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Guide

### 1. Transferring from MetaMask to Binance

1.  **Open MetaMask:** Launch the MetaMask application on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:10">[03:38:10]</a>.
2.  **Identify Cryptocurrency:** Determine which cryptocurrency you wish to transfer (e.g., USDT) and on which blockchain it resides (e.g., BNB Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:10">[03:46:10]</a>. Ensure you have a small amount of the blockchain's native token (e.g., BNB for BNB Smart Chain) to cover gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:10">[03:52:10]</a>.
3.  **Obtain Binance Deposit Address:**
    *   Open the Binance app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:10">[04:05:10]</a>.
    *   Navigate to the "Wallets" section, then "Spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:10">[04:07:10]</a>.
    *   Tap "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:10">[04:10:10]</a>.
    *   Select the cryptocurrency you want to deposit (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:10">[04:14:10]</a>.
    *   Choose the correct network (e.g., BNB Smart Chain), which must match the network your crypto is on in MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:10">[04:18:10]</a>.
    *   Copy the displayed wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:10">[04:24:10]</a>.
4.  **Send from MetaMask:**
    *   Return to MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:10">[04:28:10]</a>.
    *   Select the cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) and tap "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:10">[04:32:10]</a>.
    *   Paste the copied Binance wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:10">[04:36:10]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:10">[04:42:10]</a>.
    *   Review the gas fee (charged in BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:10">[04:53:10]</a>.
    *   Confirm and send the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:10">[05:00:10]</a>.
5.  **Verify Deposit:** Wait for the transaction to confirm. The balance should disappear from MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:10">[05:12:10]</a> and appear in your Binance spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:10">[05:38:10]</a>.

### 2. [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency on Binance]]

Once your capital is on Binance, you must [[selling_bitcoin_and_converting_to_other_cryptocurrencies | convert]] it into fiat currency (e.g., Euro, Dollar, Pound Sterling) before withdrawing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:10">[06:09:10]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Convert:**
    *   In the Binance app, go to "Markets" or "Trading" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:10">[06:28:10]</a>.
    *   Select the "Convert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:10">[06:32:10]</a>.
2.  **Perform Conversion:**
    *   Choose the cryptocurrency you want to [[selling_bitcoin_and_converting_to_other_cryptocurrencies | convert]] (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:10">[06:39:10]</a>.
    *   Select the target fiat currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:10">[06:42:10]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount and preview the conversion. Binance typically charges no [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commissions]] for direct conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:10">[06:52:10]</a>.
    *   Confirm the conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:10">[06:58:10]</a>.

### 3. [[converting_bitcoin_to_national_currency_and_bank_withdrawal | Withdrawing Fiat Currency to Bank Account]]

1.  **Initiate Withdrawal:**

2.  **Choose Withdrawal Method:**
    *   **Bank Transfer (SEPA):** This method usually costs around €1 on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:10">[07:25:10]</a>.
    *   **Bank Card:** This option might incur a higher [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commission]] (e.g., 1.8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:10">[07:38:10]</a>.
3.  **Select Currency and Confirm:**

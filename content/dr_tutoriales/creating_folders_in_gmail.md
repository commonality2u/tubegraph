This ensures emails are grouped and available to read based on priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

To achieve this, you need to [[using_filters_to_manage_emails_in_gmail | create a filter]] that automatically directs incoming emails to a chosen folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

1.  **Select an Email**: Choose an email from the sender you wish to filter. For example, an email from `no-reply@youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  **Filter Similar Messages**: Click on the three dots next to the email and select "filter similar messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

4.  **Configure Filter Actions**:
    *   **Skip the Inbox**: Select "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" to ensure emails do not appear in your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **Apply Label**: Choose the specific folder (label) where you want these emails to go, for example, "YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Apply to Existing Conversations**: Check the option to "Also apply filter to X matching conversations" to move all existing emails from that sender into the designated folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
5.  **Confirm**: Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

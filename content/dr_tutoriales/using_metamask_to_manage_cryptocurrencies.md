This article explains how to list and add the USDT token within a [[metamask_platform_features | Metamask account]], making it available for use, conversion, and storage within your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

Before proceeding, it is recommended to be familiar with using Metamask or to have created an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Further details on [[metamask_platform_features | Metamask platform features]] are available in a separate tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Adding USDT to Metamask

The process for [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | adding the USDT token]] is the same whether you are using a computer or a cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This flexibility allows for [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_via_mobile_and_computer | managing cryptocurrency transactions via mobile and computer]] effectively.

### Prerequisites

*   Ensure you are logged into your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### Steps to Add USDT

1.  **Access a Crypto Contract Platform**:
    *   Open a new browser tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
    *   Navigate to a web page that lists cryptocurrencies and their existing contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. A link to such a platform is usually provided in the first comment of related video tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
2.  **Search for USDT**:
    *   In the search bar (often labeled "CESER"), type "USDT" and open the search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   The contract for USDT should appear, often accompanied by a small fox icon if the Metamask extension is installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Two Methods for Adding USDT

#### Method 1: Manual Addition

1.  **Copy the Contract Address**: Locate and copy the contract address for USDT from the crypto contract platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  **Paste into Metamask**:
    *   Go to your Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
    *   If USDT doesn't automatically appear, look for an option to "Add Token" or similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
    *   Paste the copied contract address into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
    *   Metamask should recognize the token as USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   Confirm the addition to make the token appear in your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

#### Method 2: Using the Metamask Fox Icon

1.  **Click the Fox Icon**: On the crypto contract platform, next to the USDT contract, click the small Metamask fox icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Confirm in Metamask Notification**: A Metamask notification tab will open and load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Once loaded, you can perfectly add the token to your Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
3.  **Refresh Metamask**: Refresh the Metamask page, and the USDT token will appear, listed and ready for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Once listed, you can use the USDT token for conversions or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. This method teaches you to import the USDT token into the [[metamask_platform_features | Metamask platform]] easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

This guide outlines methods for [[how_to_insert_a_signature_in_a_pdf_document | inserting a signature]] into a PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Accessing the Signature Functionality

After opening a PDF file, navigate to the "fill out and sign" option, typically located on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This function offers several options: to fill out, sign, and send, or to obtain signatures from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. To sign with your own signature, select the "fill and sign" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

Once "fill out and sign" is selected, scroll to the desired location within the document where the signature is to be placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Types of Signatures

PDF signing tools generally provide two main ways to add a signature:

### 1. Text Signatures

You can directly type text into the document, such as writing "subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. There are many text styles available to choose from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### 2. Image Signatures

This method involves using a scanned image of a signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If you have your signature ready, you can scan it or take a photo of it, then transfer the image to your computer for insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Adding a Signature Image

To add an image signature:
1.  Click "sign" located at the top right of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Select "add a signature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
3.  Choose your signature file, which should be in an image format (e.g., from your desktop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  Alternatively, you can choose to draw the signature directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
5.  Once the signature image is selected, it can be placed anywhere in the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. It's possible to move, resize (make it bigger or smaller), and adjust its position as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Saving the Signed Document

After the document is signed, save the changes by going to "file" and selecting "save how" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Provide a new name for the file, for instance, "file name signed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, and save it. This will create a new signed PDF document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

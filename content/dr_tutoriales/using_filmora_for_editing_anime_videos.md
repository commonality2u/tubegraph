To upload anime clips, series fragments, or film segments to YouTube without facing bans due to copyright issues, specific [[Video editing techniques to avoid copyright bans on YouTube | editing techniques]] can be employed using video editing software like Filmora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Copyright issues typically arise from unauthorized use of audio (music, voices) or images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While some videos might be monetized, others can be blocked or banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Why Use Filmora?

Filmora (specifically Filmora 9 is mentioned in the transcript) is a [[Video Editing Using Filmora 10 | video editing program]] that can be used to modify video and audio content to circumvent YouTube's copyright tracking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. The suggested strategies are personal techniques that have proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Key Editing Strategies in Filmora

The goal of these [[Video editing techniques to avoid copyright bans on YouTube | editing techniques]] is to modify both the visual and audio elements of the original video to prevent YouTube from tracking its copyright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

### Adding a Channel Logo
It is recommended to add your channel's logo or a similar image throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This modification to the video's image can help prevent copyright tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Applying Visual Effects and Borders
*   **Light Leaks:** Filmora offers various effects, including "light leaks," which can alter the visual appearance of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. These effects modify the video's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Borders/Frames:** Adding a border around the video, for example, a blurred effect with different colors (like blue below and white above), is another modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The size and color of the border can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This technique involves keeping the original video on the screen with a border and logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Modifying Audio
When importing a video into Filmora, it comes with a default sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To avoid copyright issues, the volume of the original video audio should be lowered significantly, ideally to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This prevents YouTube from detecting copyrighted audio peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Viewers can still adjust the volume on YouTube if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Exporting the Edited Video
Once the video has been edited in Filmora with the logo, border, and modified audio, it can be exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Uploading to YouTube
After exporting, the edited video can be uploaded to YouTube using the "Create" and "Upload Videos" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. It's important to monitor the processing status to ensure there are no copyright restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. If the [[Using YouTube Studio for video uploads | upload process]] is successful, the video should become publicly visible without restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

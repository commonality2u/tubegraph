This guide explains how to manage Windows Defender settings, including how to enable or disable it, which can be useful for various tasks like downloading updates and installing software [00:00:10]. Windows Defender sometimes blocks downloads and updates for certain programs [00:00:17].

## Accessing Windows Security Options

To access Windows Defender settings:
1.  Navigate to the Windows taskbar, located at the bottom-left of your screen [00:00:39].
2.  Type "defend" in the search bar [00:00:43].
3.  Select the "Windows Security" option [00:00:49].
4.  Then, proceed to "antivirus protection against threats" [00:00:51].

Once inside, you can go to the home section to view all available options for defending against external threats [00:00:58].

### Navigating Security Settings
The primary option for managing Windows Defender is "antivirus protection against threats" [00:01:10]. For other security systems, such as [[navigating_windows_security_options | firewall protection]], you would typically go to option number three on the right [00:01:16]. It's also possible to access [[understanding_windows_defender_settings | Windows Defender]] directly from the menu on the left [00:01:31].

3.  A confirmation prompt will appear, which you should confirm by selecting "yes" [00:01:56].
4.  Proceed to deactivate all related components, including:
    *   Real-time protection [00:02:09]
    *   Cloud-based protection [00:02:26]
    *   Sending sample (takes tico protection) [00:02:27]

Once these steps are completed, Windows Defender will be deactivated [00:02:35]. If you return to the start section, you will see a red cross on the antivirus protection, indicating it is completely disabled [00:02:43].

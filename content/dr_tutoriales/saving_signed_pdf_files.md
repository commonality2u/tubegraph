After [[filling_and_signing_pdf_documents | filling and signing a PDF document]], you can save the modified file to preserve the changes, including the newly added signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Process for Saving

To save a PDF document after adding a signature:

1.  Navigate to the "File" option within your PDF viewer/editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
2.  Select "Save How" (Save As) from the menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
3.  Assign a desired name to the file. For example, you might add a descriptive tag like "Harriet signature" to indicate the document has been signed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
4.  Click "Save" to finalize the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

After saving, you will typically have two versions of the document: the original unsigned PDF and the newly saved signed PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. When you open the signed version, the inserted signature will be visible within the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

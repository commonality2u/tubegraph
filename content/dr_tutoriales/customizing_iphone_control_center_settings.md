## Accessing Control Center Settings

To begin, navigate to your iPhone's **Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. From there, locate and enter the **Control Center** section, identified by a gray icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Do not try to access it directly from within apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Once in the Control Center settings, select **Customize Controls** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Adding Screen Recording to Control Center

Within **Customize Controls**, you will find various options, such as the stopwatch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The option of interest for this guide is **Screen Recording** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

If **Screen Recording** is already listed, it means it's available in your Control Center <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. You can also reorder its position within the Control Center to your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Using the Screen Recorder

With Screen Recording activated in your Control Center, you can access it at any time by sliding down from the top of your screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This action reveals the Control Center, where the screen recorder option will be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

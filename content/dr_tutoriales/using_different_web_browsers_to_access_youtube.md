Compatible browsers include [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]], Microsoft Edge, Opera, and Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

*   The installed YouTube application will be registered with your [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google]] account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

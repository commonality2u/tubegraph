[[using_mega_for_file_sharing | MEGA]] is a web page used for uploading and downloading content, enabling one person to upload files for others to download [00:00:17]. It is commonly used to [[using_mega_for_file_sharing | share files]] like series, movies, or documents [00:00:27].

## Creating a MEGA Account
To [[creating_a_mega_account | create a MEGA account]], you simply need to enter an email address [00:00:45]. After entering your email, you will receive a confirmation email that you need to verify to complete the account creation [00:00:49].

## MEGA Storage Options
Upon creating an account, MEGA presents various usage plans [00:00:57]. The free plan offers up to 50 gigabytes of storage [00:01:08]. While this amount is considered relatively small, it is sufficient for storing small or relatively small files [00:01:17]. Paid options, such as Lite or Pro accounts, are available for users who require more storage [00:01:30]. This guide focuses on working with the default free account [00:01:41].

## Uploading Files to MEGA
To [[uploading_files_to_mega | upload files to MEGA]], navigate to the "cloud" symbol within your account [00:02:04]. From there, you can choose to upload new folders or individual files [00:02:07].

## Optimizing Storage with Compression
To make the most of the free 50 GB storage, it is recommended to [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compress files]] before uploading them [00:01:21].

### Compressing Files with WinRAR
WinRAR is a program used to compress files [00:02:47].
To compress a file or folder:
1.  Right-click on the file or folder you wish to compress [00:02:53].
2.  Select "Add to archive..." (indicated by the WinRAR books logo) [00:02:56].
3.  In the compression settings:
    *   Set the archive format to "RAR" [00:03:03].
    *   Choose "Best" as the compression method [00:03:06].
    *   Select "Create solid archive" [00:03:10].
4.  Click "OK" to start the compression process [00:03:16].

For example, a folder weighing 2.21 gigabytes (representing about 20 GB when decompressed due to 8 sub-files) was compressed to 13.1 gigabytes [00:02:25], [00:03:42], resulting in a saving of approximately 8-9 gigabytes [00:03:54].

Once compressed, the file is ready to be uploaded to MEGA by selecting "Upload file" from the cloud menu and choosing the compressed file [00:04:03].

## Managing and Sharing MEGA Links
After a file has been uploaded to the MEGA cloud, it can be shared with others [00:04:24].

### Generating a Shareable Link
To share an uploaded file:
1.  Right-click on the uploaded file [00:04:58].
2.  Select the "Manage link" option [00:05:04].
3.  This will generate a link, known as a "link with key" [00:05:09].

### Sharing the Link and Encryption Key
The generated link allows others to access the content [00:05:11]. To ensure secure access, the link comes with an encryption key [00:05:21].
1.  To retrieve the key, click on "cipher key" [00:05:24].
2.  Copy the provided key [00:05:27].

Users who receive the link will need to enter this key to download the shared content [00:05:31].

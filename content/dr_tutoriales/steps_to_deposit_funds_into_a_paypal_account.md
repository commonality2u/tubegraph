This guide explains how to deposit funds into your PayPal account, whether from a computer or mobile phone, as the process is exactly the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Accessing the Deposit Feature

1.  Log into your [[paypal_account_setup_for_sending_money | PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "PayPal balance" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
3.  You will see an option to "Transfer money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Alternatively, you can go to "My wallet" and then select "Transfer Money" there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
4.  Once in the transfer options, choose "Add money to your balance PayPal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Methods for Adding Funds

There are two primary methods to add money to your PayPal balance:

### 1. Using a [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | Linked Bank Account]]

This method requires you to [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | link a bank account]] to your PayPal profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. You would then log into your bank's services to initiate the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### 2. Performing a Physical Bank Transfer

You can go to a physical bank and perform a transfer to the PayPal banking account using the specific details provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Important Prerequisite: [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | Linking and Verifying a Bank Account]]

It is crucial to understand that if you attempt to [[transferring_money_between_a_bank_and_paypal | transfer funds]] from a bank account that is not [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to PayPal]], the transfer will be automatically rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This is because PayPal needs to recognize the bank account as associated with your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### How to [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | Link and Verify Your Bank Account]]

Linking a bank account is generally fast and simple, taking about one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The process involves:
*   PayPal making a small transfer (e.g., one cent) to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   You then confirm the exact amount of that transfer within PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   Once confirmed, your bank account will be officially [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]] to your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## Completing the Deposit

Once your bank account is [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]], you can proceed with the deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. You will use the banking details provided on the screen, including the IBAN and beneficiary bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   You do not need to put anything in the "concept" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   It is important to enter the name of the beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   You will receive an email confirmation once the transfer is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Transfer Timeline

Bank transfers can take one to two days to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It's important to note that non-working days (weekends and holidays) do not count within this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

This tutorial on [[using_binance_futures_app_on_mobile | using the Binance Futures application on a mobile device]] assumes that the user already has a futures account open [00:01:44].

If you do not know how to open a futures account, another tutorial is available via the video's cards to guide you through the process [00:01:47].

For those who do not yet have a futures account, a referral link is provided in the video's first comment, offering a 10% discount on commissions whenever deposits, transactions, operations, or withdrawals of capital are made [00:00:33]. This percentage is useful for saving on cryptocurrencies and for purchasing other desired cryptocurrencies [00:00:44].

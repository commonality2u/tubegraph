Creating a professional form with Google Forms involves understanding various question types and configuration settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin, ensure you are logged into your Google account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Google Forms can be accessed by navigating to the Google applications menu on the right side of your browser and searching for the purple "Forms" logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Upon accessing Google Forms, you can choose from various [[google_forms_templates | templates]], such as contact data, attendance confirmation, party invitations, or order requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Alternatively, you can [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | create a new blank form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Basic Form Structure

After selecting a blank form, you can set its title and description:
*   **Form Title**: For instance, "Doubts form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Form Description**: A brief explanation of the form's purpose, such as "This form is used to transmit your doubts to me and see if we can solve them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Question Types

Google Forms offers various [[using_different_question_types_in_google_forms | question types]] to gather different kinds of information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:

*   **Short Answer**: Suitable for brief responses like "Name" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> or "Gmail" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Paragraph**: For longer, more detailed responses, such as "Explain your doubts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Google Forms may automatically detect this type based on keywords like "explain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Multiple Options (Multiple Choice)**: Allows respondents to select one option from a predefined list. Example: "You have subscribed to the channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes**: Allows respondents to select multiple options from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Dropdown**: Similar to multiple options, but displays options in a dropdown menu, which can save space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **File Upload**: Enables respondents to upload files, such as screenshots, directly to Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. You can set it to allow specific file types, maximum number of files, and maximum size per file (e.g., 100MB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Date and Time**: Useful for scheduling or asking for specific dates and times, such as "when you could use having a meeting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Linear Scale**: Allows respondents to rate something on a scale, for example, "satisfaction of the tutorial" from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## Question Settings

For each question, you can adjust settings to control how respondents interact with it:
*   **[[mandatory_fields_in_google_forms | Mandatory Fields]]**: You can make a question required by toggling the "Mandatory" option, indicated by an asterisk (*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. If a mandatory question is not answered, the form cannot be submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Adding Questions**: Click the "Add question" icon to add new questions to your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Form Configuration

The "Settings" tab in Google Forms provides [[advanced_features_in_google_forms_for_surveys | advanced features for surveys]] to manage responses and presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>:

### Responses
*   **Collecting Email Addresses**: You can choose to automatically collect email addresses of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Allow Response Editing**: This setting allows respondents to modify their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Limit to One Response**: You can restrict each user to submitting only one response, though this might not always be suitable for forms where users might have multiple inquiries over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Maximum Size of All Uploaded Files**: Set an overall limit for all files uploaded to the form (e.g., 1 GB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Presentation
*   **Display Progress Bar**: Shows a progress bar to respondents as they fill out the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Confirmation Message**: Customize the message respondents see after submitting the form (e.g., "Reply sent. Correct. Subscribe.") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Show Link to Send Another Response**: Allows respondents to submit the form multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Default Values**: Configure default settings for future forms you create, such as automatically registering email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

## Customization and Sharing

### Customizing the Theme
You can [[how_to_customize_surveys_in_google_forms | customize the form's appearance]] by changing the theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This includes altering the header, fonts, and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Emojis can also be added to questions to make them more visually appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

### Sending the Form
To share your form, click "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. Options for [[sharing_and_customization_options_in_google_forms | sharing and customization]] include:
*   **Email**: Invite people directly by email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Link**: Generate a shareable link, which can be shortened for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This is recommended if you want the survey to be anonymous, as sending by email will reveal your email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Embed HTML**: Get HTML code to embed the form directly into a web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Note that embedding HTML is not possible if the form includes a file upload option; you would need to remove the file upload question to generate the embed code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

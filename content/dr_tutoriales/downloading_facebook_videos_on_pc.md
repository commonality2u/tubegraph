*   Remove these sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Replace them with an `M` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   Press Enter to load the mobile version of the page on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

This article outlines how to track and analyze referral activities within the Pods platform, including accessing the referral program, understanding its benefits, and monitoring commissions and user behavior.

## Accessing the Referral Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>

To access the referral section:
1. Navigate to the main page of your Pods account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
2. Hover over or click on your profile icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
3. Select the "Referral Program" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The referral program can also be accessed on mobile by opening the Pods application, going to your profile, and selecting the "Referral Program" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Benefits of the Referral Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

The Pods referral program allows users to invite friends to earn cryptocurrencies together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Referrers can earn up to 40% commission every time their referred friends engage in trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

New users who sign up using a referral link can receive a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, operations, or capital withdrawals within their Pods account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Understanding Referral Mechanics and Commission Sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>

When a person opens an account using your referral link, they receive a 10% discount on the commissions they pay for deposits, transactions, or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Simultaneously, the referrer receives that 10% as a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

For instance, if you use a referral link and pay 10% in commissions, the referrer receives that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Conversely, if others use your link, you receive their 10% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

It is recommended to use referral links with people known to be active in investments or cryptocurrency trading to maximize [[referral_commissions_and_benefits | benefits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Commission Percentage Customization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>

The platform allows for varying commission percentages between the referrer and the referred user. While a default is 10% for both, it's possible to configure links where the referrer receives 20% and the referred user receives 0%, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

To [[creating_and_managing_referral_links | generate a new link]], you can choose how the percentage is split, typically 0%, 5%, or 10% for the referred user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Higher percentages (15% or 20% for the referrer, 0% for the referred) become available if your account balance exceeds 500 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

> "I always put 10% [for the referred person] because I think it is the most ethical thing for you to take advantage of this referral link and that you have that discount on commissions and also that you take that 10% of all those transactions that I carry out." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>

## Referral Program Dashboard Sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

The referral program interface includes several sections for [[navigating_the_amazon_affiliates_platform | management and tracking]]:

*   **Control Panel**: Displays an overview of your referral earnings and activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, it might show total bitcoins earned, the number of transactions made by referrals, and the total number of referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **List of Links**: Shows all the referral links you have created, including their specific commission split configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Friends List**: Provides a list of users who have signed up using your referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   **History of Commissions**: Detailed records of commissions earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Shared Commissions**: Shows commissions shared with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Monitoring Referral Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>

The dashboard provides key metrics to track your referral program's performance:
*   **Earned Bitcoins**: The total amount of Bitcoin earned from referral commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Transactions**: The total number of transactions made by your referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Total Referrals**: The cumulative count of users who have signed up using your links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

A classification system categorizes referrers based on the Bitcoin amount they have earned from referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Analyzing Referred User Activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>

The "Friends List" section provides insights into the activity of your referred users:
*   **User ID**: The unique identifier for each referred user (names are not displayed to maintain privacy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Account Type**: Indicates the type of account they have (e.g., spot, mining, futures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Operations**: Shows where they conduct their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Registration Time**: When the user registered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Transaction Status**: Indicates if they have performed operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Commission History and Cryptocurrency Earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>

The "History of Commissions" section allows you to view profits earned from your affiliates' transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. You can filter this history by specific account types such as spot, futures, or mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Commissions are earned in the specific cryptocurrency that the referred person purchased or traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. For example, if a referred user buys Polkadot, the commission will be received in Polkadot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. While the dashboard might display an equivalent value in Bitcoin, the actual earnings are in the respective altcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This feature can be useful for understanding what cryptocurrencies your referred users are actively trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

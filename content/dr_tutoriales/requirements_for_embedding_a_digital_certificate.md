To embed an electronic ID card and use associated digital certificates on a mobile device, certain prerequisites must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Mobile Embedding

The indispensable requirement before embedding a digital certificate on a mobile phone is to have the digital certificate already installed on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Installation on Computer
The electronic ID card itself is a container; it does not directly contain the digital certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The digital certificate must be [[process_of_downloading_and_installing_the_digital_certificate | previously installed on a computer]] before it can be transferred to a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This step is a necessary precursor to embedding the certificate on a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Importance of Prior Steps
Attempting to embed the digital certificate on a mobile device without first completing the necessary steps on a computer will not be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Device-Specific Requirements

While the overall process for [[managing_digital_certificates_on_mobile_devices | managing digital certificates on mobile devices]] is similar between Android and iOS, there are specific device requirements related to NFC (Near Field Communication) functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Android Devices
For Android devices, the NFC antenna needs to be manually activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### iPhone Devices
On iPhones, the NFC antenna, which enables features like mobile payments, is already activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. No additional management is required for its activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## General Requirements for [[managing_digital_certificates_on_mobile_devices | Managing Digital Certificates on Mobile Devices]]

To proceed with embedding the certificate, users will need to download a specific application, such as "Digital Certificate" (or "Certificado Digital"), from their device's app store (e.g., App Store for iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. It is important to verify that the application's creator is the certified digital FNT to ensure data security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Once the app is installed, the process involves steps like:
*   Reading the chip of the electronic ID (DNIe) using the mobile device's NFC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   Accepting terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   Entering an electronic email for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
*   Inputting the CAN code from the physical ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   Providing the PIN associated with the DNI, which is typically obtained or renewed at a police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

The mobile device needs to be placed near the electronic ID card, typically near the top where the NFC antenna is located, to detect and read the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Upon successful reading, the certificate request can be confirmed and installed on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

If you have sent an email within [[Outlook email options for delaying delivery | Outlook]] and wish to cancel or delete its shipping, this guide outlines the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This method allows you to either delete the message entirely or delete it and send a modified version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Prerequisite

For this process to be successful, it is crucial that the recipient has **not yet opened the message** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the message has already been opened, this method will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Steps to Cancel or Delete an Email

1.  **Send the Email**: Begin by sending the email you wish to potentially recall later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, an email can be addressed to "Rafael Ruiz Iglesias" with the subject "subscribe and Like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Sent Messages**: Go to your "Sent Messages" folder within Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  **Select the Email**: Locate and click on the specific email you want to cancel or delete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This action will open the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Recall/Delete**:
    *   Within the opened email, look for a button that allows you to "edit the message" or "Remove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Click on this button, which typically has a specific symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
5.  **Choose an Option**: You will be presented with two main options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
    *   **Delete the message completely**: This option will ensure the message no longer appears in the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Delete it and send another modification**: This allows you to recall the original email and then send a revised version, for instance, if you forgot to add a closing remark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
6.  **Confirm Notification (Optional)**: A prompt will appear asking if you want to be notified whether the recall or modification was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. You can choose to be notified or proceed without it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
7.  **Finalize Deletion**: If you solely want to delete the message, select that option and click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. A confirmation will appear stating that you have attempted the recall of the message, and if successful, it will be totally eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> This feature only works if the recipient has **not yet opened the email** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

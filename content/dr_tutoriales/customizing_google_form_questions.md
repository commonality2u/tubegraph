To [[how_to_create_a_google_form | create a Google Form]], you begin by accessing [[accessing_google_forms_through_google_chrome | Google Forms]] and selecting a blank form to build from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This allows for full control over [[customizing_survey_questions_and_responses | question customization]] and setup.

## Form Structure
Every Google Form requires a title and a description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. For example, a "Doubts form" could have the description: "This form is used to transmit your doubts to me and see if we can solve them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Adding and Configuring Questions
After setting the title and description, you can add your first question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. New questions can be added by clicking the "Add question" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Each question can be configured with specific response types and settings.

### Question Types
Google Forms offers various question types to collect different kinds of information:

*   **Short Answer:** Ideal for brief responses like names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> or email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Paragraph:** Used for longer, more detailed text responses, such as explaining doubts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Google Forms may auto-detect if a long response is needed based on keywords like "explain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Multiple Choice ("Several options"):** Allows respondents to select one option from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Examples include "you have subscribed to the channel" or "you have given Like the video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes:** Similar to multiple choice but allows respondents to select multiple options from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Dropdown:** Presents a list of options in a dropdown menu, which functions similarly to multiple choice but displays options differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **File Upload:** Enables respondents to upload files, such as screenshots, directly to Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. You can set restrictions on file types, maximum number of files, and maximum size per file (e.g., 100MB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Linear Scale:** Used for rating on a scale, for instance, from 1 (very dissatisfied) to 5 (very satisfied) for a tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Date and Time:** Allows respondents to input a specific date or time, useful for scheduling meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Question Settings
For each question, you can configure:

*   **Mandatory Response:** Questions can be set as "mandatory," requiring respondents to provide an answer before submitting the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Mandatory questions are indicated by an asterisk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   **Reordering Questions:** Questions can be reordered within the form layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Enhancing Form Appearance
Beyond the question content, you can [[google_forms_configuration_settings | customize the theme]] of your Google Form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This includes changing the header, font styles, and colors to match your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Emojis can also be added to question titles or descriptions for a more engaging look <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Payoneer is a versatile platform that can be accessed via computer or a mobile application [00:59:00]. It offers an interactive menu on the left side of the screen, providing access to various sections, including 'beginning part', 'receiving', 'paying', 'withdrawing and transfers', 'Account', 'Banks & Cards', and 'Network of business' [01:27:00]. Users can access notifications [01:41:00], customer support available in multiple languages (Spanish, English) and regions (Spain, Latin America, United States) [01:44:00], and manage their profile details [02:04:00].

## Account Types

Payoneer offers two primary types of accounts:
*   **Individual Account** (also referred to as Private Account) [02:24:00]
*   **Company Account** (also referred to as Business Account) [02:28:00]

A key distinction between these accounts lies in transaction compatibility. A company account cannot receive transfers from a personal bank account; transfers must originate from another company account [02:46:00]. This is an important consideration when depositing funds [03:03:00].

### Business Account Specific Functionalities
For company accounts, the platform includes a "store manager" [07:48:00] which allows users to manage their businesses and the companies they work with [07:54:00]. It also provides visibility into various business applications linked to the Payoneer platform [08:02:00].

## General Account Features and Functionalities

Regardless of the account type, Payoneer accounts offer a range of features for managing funds:

*   **Multi-currency Support**
    Accounts can hold various currencies, such as US dollars, Euros, and British pounds sterling [03:26:00].
    For each currency, Payoneer automatically opens an associated bank account, including for the Eurozone, United Kingdom, and United States [03:51:00]. Users can [[managing_currencies_and_transactions_with_payoneer | request additional accounts]] in different currencies [04:19:00].

*   **Fund Management**
    *   [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | Requesting payments]] and making payments are core functionalities [04:56:00].
    *   Payments can be made to other Payoneer accounts or recipient bank accounts [05:17:00].
    *   Users can manage recipient accounts and make batch payments [05:24:00].
    *   The platform allows for paying bills for Amazon advertising or VAT [05:29:00].
    *   [[payoneer_fees_and_how_to_navigate_them | Commissions]] associated with transactions vary based on the type of operation, and users are encouraged to review these details [05:39:00].

    *   Users can [[managing_currencies_and_transactions_with_payoneer | manage currencies]] by converting funds from one currency to another (e.g., Euros to Dollars) [06:29:00].

*   **Account Activity and Reporting**
    *   The "account activity" section displays transactions and payment requests [06:54:00].
    *   Monthly statements are available, which can be useful for tax declarations in a user's country [06:59:00].
    *   The platform features a reputation system where other users can leave reviews [07:10:00].

*   **Integrations and Cards**
    *   Payoneer accounts can be linked to Amazon accounts [07:17:00].
    *   Users can [[requesting_and_using_a_payoneer_card | apply for a Payoneer card]] [07:22:00]. A requirement for applying for a card is having received at least $100 in payments within the last six months [07:29:00].

*   **Referral Program**
    Users can [[paypal_account_setup_with_referral_links | refer a friend]] to Payoneer [08:05:00]. Using a referral link when [[how_to_create_and_set_up_a_payoneer_account | creating an account]] can earn the new user up to $25 when their first deposit reaches $1000 within the platform [00:16:00].

Gmail allows users to assign colors to labels, which helps visually distinguish and [[organizing_emails_with_labels | organize emails]] in the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This feature can make it easier to identify emails at a glance, especially those related to specific categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## How to Apply Colors to Labels

To set up color coding for your email labels:

1.  **Access Gmail Configuration**: Navigate to your Gmail account and go to the configuration settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  **Select Labels Window**: Within the configuration, choose the "Labels" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This section displays existing labels and allows for [[creating_labels_in_gmail | creating new ones]] or modifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
3.  **Choose a Label**: Locate the label you wish to color code, for instance, a main label like "YouTube" or a sub-label like "YouTube subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
4.  **Assign a Color**: Select the desired color for the label. For example, a "YouTube" label might be assigned the color red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
5.  **Apply to Sub-labels**: If a main label has sub-labels (similar to [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | creating different folders]]), you can also apply the same color to them for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Visual Impact in the Inbox

Once a color is assigned to a label, all emails tagged with that label will appear with the chosen color in the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. This provides a quick visual cue, making it easier to [[filtering_and_managing_emails_in_gmail | filter]] and manage your emails based on their category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For example, all emails related to "subscriptions" and "YouTube" will appear in red if that color is chosen for their respective labels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

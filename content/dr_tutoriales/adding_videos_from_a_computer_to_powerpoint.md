## Key Differences: On-PC vs. Online Videos

PowerPoint offers two primary ways to [[importing_videos_into_powerpoint | import videos into PowerPoint]]:
*   **Video on My PC**: These videos are embedded directly from your computer files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Online Video**: These videos are linked from online sources like YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. [[using_youtube_videos_in_powerpoint | Using YouTube videos in PowerPoint]] or [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | inserting online videos in presentation slides]] requires an active internet connection for playback during the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

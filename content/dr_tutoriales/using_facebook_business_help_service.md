This guide provides [[steps_to_solve_facebook_account_issues | steps to solve Facebook account issues]] by contacting Facebook Support, specifically through their business help service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The process can seem complicated, but by following specific steps, users can initiate contact and receive assistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Accessing Facebook Support

Initially, navigating to the general Facebook help link often leads to FAQs that do not allow direct contact with support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. To circumvent this, the necessary approach is to access the "Help service for businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

> [!INFO] Company Creation
> If you have not yet created a company on Facebook, you can do so quickly and easily using your existing Facebook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This is a prerequisite for accessing the business help features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Navigating the Business Help Service

Once in the business help section, avoid the general options and proceed directly to "First steps" or "Get in Service with the service contact of attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Within this section, you will find:
*   **Help Account Overview for businesses** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>
*   **Recent Problems of the account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
*   **Resolved problems** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   **My accounts** (including active and solved cases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

## [[how_to_contact_facebook_support | How to contact Facebook support]]: Initiating Contact

To speak with support, locate the "If I need help" option and click "Contact the service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Specifying the Problem

This is a critical step, as many problems redirect to other websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Even if your problem is unrelated to the provided categories, you must select one to proceed to chat with an agent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

A recommended category to select is "I think someone has accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### [[providing_information_to_facebook_support | Providing information to Facebook support]]

After selecting a problem, you will need to provide specific information:
1.  **Company name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>
2.  **Full name** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>
3.  **Detailed explanation of your issue:** For example, "I need help to recover My Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
4.  **User Identifier** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>
5.  **Date of suspicious time** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>
6.  **Confirmation of suspicious activity:**
    *   Have you detected any suspicious user? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>
    *   Have you detected any advertising account with suspicious activity? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>

### [[initiating_a_chat_with_facebook_company_support | Initiating a chat with Facebook company support]]

After providing the required information, click "initiate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. You will see an estimated wait time before clicking "Start chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This will open a chat window with Facebook Company Chat, typically on the right side of the screen, where you will wait for a representative to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Expect to wait several minutes for a response, sometimes around seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

When transferring money to your PayPal account, it's important to understand the process and potential issues to ensure a smooth transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Depositing Funds into PayPal

The primary method to deposit funds into your PayPal account involves linking a bank account and initiating a transfer from that bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Steps to Deposit
1.  Log in to your PayPal account, either on a computer or mobile phone, as the process is the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "PayPal balance" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> or the "my wallet" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
3.  Select the option to "Transfer money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
4.  Choose to "Add money to your balance PayPal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>.
5.  You can then choose to:
    *   Use a [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | bank account linked to PayPal]] and log in to your bank's online services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
    *   Go to a physical bank and perform a transfer to the PayPal banking account using the provided details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Common Issues: Unlinked Bank Accounts

The most significant issue when attempting to deposit funds is not having a [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | bank account linked to PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Transfer Rejection
> If you attempt a transfer from a bank account that is not [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to PayPal]], the transfer will be automatically rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This happens because PayPal does not recognize the bank account as associated with your PayPal profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Solution: Linking and Verifying Your Bank Account

To successfully deposit funds, you must first [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | link your bank account]] to your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

### [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | Bank Account Verification Process]]
1.  The [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | linking process]] typically takes one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>.
2.  PayPal will initiate a small transfer, such as one centime, to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
3.  You will then need to confirm the exact amount of this small transfer within your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For example, if PayPal sends a penny, you must confirm that it was a penny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
4.  Once the amount is confirmed, your bank account will be successfully [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to your PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Transfer Details After Linking
Once your bank account is [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]], you can make a deposit using the banking details provided by PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. These details include an IBAN and beneficiary bank information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

*   You do not need to add anything in the "concept" field of the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   It is important to enter the name of the beneficiary as instructed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   After the transfer, you will receive an email confirmation. The funds can take one to two working days to appear in your PayPal balance, as bank transfers do not count non-working days within this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

## Other Considerations

*   **Currencies**: PayPal accounts can handle different currencies, with the primary currency typically being the euro, but you can add others like the pound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
*   **Referral Link**: If you open a new PayPal account using a referral link provided in the first comment, you may receive up to ten euros when you make a shipment within the PayPal platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## Method 1: The "Convert" Feature (Easy Method)

This method is straightforward and recommended for direct conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Steps to Convert

1.  Navigate to the "Trading" tab at the top of the [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  Select "Convert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you want to convert from (e.g., CITY) and the target cryptocurrency you want to convert to (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount to convert (e.g., "maximum") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
5.  Click "Preview Conversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Ensure you have the minimum required quantity for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
6.  A conversion price will appear. You have a limited time (e.g., five seconds) to confirm the conversion due to cryptocurrency price volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
7.  Click "Convert" to complete the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
8.  The converted quantity and price will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. You can view the status of your conversions within your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Limitations of Method 1

*   This method only allows conversion between cryptocurrencies that are directly available for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If your desired target cryptocurrency is not listed (e.g., Polkadot from CITY), you cannot use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Commissions for Method 1

*   [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] generally does not charge commissions for Over-The-Counter (OTC) operations using the convert feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   However, there may be a "spread" where prices differ slightly from the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. No direct commission is associated with cryptocurrency conversions using Method 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Method 2: Using the "Markets" Feature (More Complex but Flexible)

This method is useful when Method 1 does not support your desired conversion pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It often involves two steps.

### Steps to Convert

1.  Go to the [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | Binance]] platform and navigate to the "Markets" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  In the "Markets" section, select the "Zones" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
3.  Choose the base cryptocurrency you want to convert (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
4.  If your desired direct conversion is not available, you will need to perform two steps:
    *   **Step 1:** Convert your initial cryptocurrency to an intermediate, widely traded stablecoin (e.g., USDT) or a major cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   **Step 2:** Then, convert that intermediate cryptocurrency to your final desired cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
        *   For example, to convert Polkadot (DOT) if a direct pair isn't available, you might first convert DOT to USDT, and then USDT to your target coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Performing a Market Order Conversion (Example)

This example demonstrates [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | buying]] BNB with USDT.

1.  From the "Markets" section, search for the trading pair you want (e.g., BNB/USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
2.  Select the desired pair to open its trading interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
3.  Choose a "Market Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This means the order will execute immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount of your existing cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) you want to use to buy the new cryptocurrency (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
5.  Confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Your new cryptocurrency will be bought instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

If you then want to convert this newly acquired cryptocurrency to another, you would repeat the process, going to the corresponding market pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. For instance, to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_through_binance | buy]] Polkadot (DOT) with your BNB, you would go to the BNB/DOT market pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

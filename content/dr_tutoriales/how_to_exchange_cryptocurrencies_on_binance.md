This article provides a guide on [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | converting cryptocurrencies]] on the Binance platform, outlining two primary methods: the "Convert" feature and using the "Markets" section for more complex exchanges. The goal is to allow users to [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | manage their cryptocurrency portfolio]] and potentially gain profitability through strategic conversions based on market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

Before beginning, users can utilize a referral link (often found in the video's first comment) to create a Binance account, which provides a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, transactions, operations, or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Additionally, there are resources available that explain how to invest cryptocurrencies within Binance's products to earn compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Method 1: The "Convert" Feature

This method is considered the easiest and simplest way to [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | exchange cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Steps to Convert

1.  Navigate to the "Trading" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  Select the "Convert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you want to convert from (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Choose the target cryptocurrency you want to convert to (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
5.  Enter the desired amount to convert. A minimum quantity might be required for certain conversions (e.g., 10 units for some currencies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
6.  Click "Preview Conversion" to see the exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
7.  Confirm the conversion within five seconds due to potential price volatility of the cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Limitations of Method 1

The "Convert" method is straightforward but has a significant limitation: it only allows conversions between a predetermined list of available cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If your desired target cryptocurrency is not listed as an option for direct conversion from your source cryptocurrency (e.g., Polkadot from BNB), this method cannot be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Commissions for Method 1

Binance states that no direct commissions are charged for OTC (Over-The-Counter) operations using the convert feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, there will be a "spread" â€“ meaning the price at which you buy or sell might be slightly different from the exact market price at that instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Method 2: Using the "Markets" Section

This method is slightly more complex but allows for [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | cryptocurrency exchanges]] that are not available through the "Convert" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This method essentially involves [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | trading]] on the spot market.

### Steps for Complex Conversions

For cryptocurrencies that lack a direct conversion pair, a two-step process is often required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

1.  **Intermediate Conversion**: Convert your initial cryptocurrency to a widely traded intermediary stablecoin or major cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT, BNB, BTC). These intermediaries are commonly paired with many other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   Go to the "Markets" section on the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Select the "Crypto" zone and choose the appropriate pair (e.g., if you want to convert Cardano (ADA) to Polkadot (DOT) but there's no direct ADA/DOT pair, you might convert ADA to USDT first) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
    *   Open the trading tab for the desired pair (e.g., ADA/USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
    *   Place a market order to sell your initial cryptocurrency for the intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. A market order executes immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
2.  **Final Conversion**: Convert the intermediary cryptocurrency to your final desired cryptocurrency.
    *   Find the trading pair for your intermediary and the target cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT/DOT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   Place a market order to buy your final cryptocurrency using the intermediary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

This two-step process effectively bridges the conversion gap when direct pairs are unavailable, allowing users to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | exchange a wider range of cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For example, to convert Bitcoin from Coinbase to Binance, then convert to BNB, you might first deposit Bitcoin, convert Bitcoin to a stablecoin, then convert the stablecoin to BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

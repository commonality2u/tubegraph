[[creating_a_survey_using_google_forms | Creating a survey within Google Forms]] allows users to collect structured information through various question types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide outlines how to utilize different question types when [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | creating a form]] or survey.

## Accessing Google Forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

To access Google Forms, navigate to the Google applications menu (represented by circles) usually found on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. From there, select the purple Forms icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Starting a New Survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

While Google Forms offers various templates like attendance confirmation, appointment scheduling, contact details, customer feedback, event comments, or order forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, it is often more suitable to start with a blank form for a custom survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Survey Title and Description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
Begin by adding a title to your survey, such as "Survey Number One" or "Survey on Belfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Below the title, include a description, which can be customized with formatting options like bold or italics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. An example description could be "Survey for the final degree project of the psychology course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Incorporating Different Question Types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

When [[creating_a_survey_using_google_forms | creating a survey]], selecting the appropriate question type is crucial. Google Forms offers several options that are particularly useful for surveys.

### Common Survey Question Types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>

For surveys, the most commonly used question types include:

*   **Multiple Options (Multiple Choice)**: Allows respondents to choose one option from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. You can add multiple options as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes**: Enables respondents to select multiple options from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Dropdowns**: Presents options in a dropdown menu, from which respondents select one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Linear Scales**: Useful for evaluating satisfaction or intensity on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, to ask "How much have you liked Belfast?", a scale from "very little" (1) to "much" (5) can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Less Common, but Available, Question Types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

While less common for typical surveys, these options are available:

*   **Short Answer**: Generally not applied for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Paragraph**: Not typically used for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Multiple Options Grid**: Allows respondents to select one option per row from a grid of choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Checkbox Grid**: Enables respondents to select multiple options per row from a grid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Date**: Allows respondents to input a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Time**: Allows respondents to input a specific time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Advanced Features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>

[[advanced_features_in_google_forms_for_surveys | Advanced features]] include the ability to limit the time respondents have to complete the survey using a plugin, which is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

## Previewing the Survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>

To see how your survey will appear to respondents, use the "preview" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This allows you to check the layout and functionality of your questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Survey Settings and Responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>

After [[how_to_customize_surveys_in_google_forms | customizing your survey]] with various question types, you can configure its settings:

*   **Convert to Questionnaire**: This option allows you to assign scores, define correct answers, and provide automatic feedback, primarily used for tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Collect Email Addresses**: You can choose to collect the email addresses of respondents, which can be useful for verifying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Send Copies of Replies**: Allows respondents to receive a copy of their submitted answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Allow Modification of Answers**: Decide if respondents can edit their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Limit to One Response**: Restrict each person to filling out the survey only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

Once the survey is created, you can [[how_to_view_responses_in_google_forms | view responses]] in the "Answers" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. [[managing_survey_responses_in_google_forms | Managing survey responses]] and [[analyzing_google_forms_responses_using_google_sheets | analyzing Google Forms responses using Google Sheets]] will be covered in separate tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Default settings can be saved for future forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

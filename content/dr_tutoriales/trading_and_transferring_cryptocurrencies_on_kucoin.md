This article provides a tutorial on how to deposit capital into the KuCoin platform, purchase cryptocurrencies, and transfer cryptocurrencies from other platforms. It also covers the trading interface and commission structures.

## Depositing Fiat Money on KuCoin

To deposit fiat money (such as Euros, US Dollars, or British Pounds) into KuCoin:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section from the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
2.  Select "Credit/Debit Card" as the initial option. Other payment methods like Apple Pay or bank transfers (e.g., SEPA) may also be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired fiat currency (e.g., EUR for Euros, USD for US Dollars, GP for British Pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.
4.  Input the amount you wish to deposit. There will be a minimum and maximum amount specified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
5.  Select the cryptocurrency you wish to convert your fiat into. It is recommended to convert to a stablecoin like USDT for a stable conversion, rather than directly to a volatile asset like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
6.  Review the commissions. The commission amount can vary depending on the payment method and the payment channel used (e.g., "Pance" is mentioned as an intermediary payment channel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. These commissions are typically charged by the intermediary service that facilitates the conversion of fiat money to crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
7.  Confirm the transaction and fill in your payment details on the subsequent page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
    *   Card transfers are generally processed within minutes, while bank transfers may take business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

To transfer cryptocurrencies from another platform (e.g., [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]]) to KuCoin:
1.  Log in to your KuCoin account and go to the "Assets" section, then "Summary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
2.  Click on "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.
3.  Select the cryptocurrency you intend to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. Ensure you select the "Main Account" for deposit, as this is the primary account used for general deposits and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
4.  KuCoin will provide a unique deposit address for the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
5.  Open the platform from which you wish to transfer the cryptocurrency (e.g., Binance). Navigate to its withdrawal section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.
6.  Choose the same cryptocurrency you selected on KuCoin for withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
7.  Paste the KuCoin deposit address into the withdrawal address field on the sending platform. The network (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20) should automatically be detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
8.  Review the minimum withdrawal amount and network commissions before confirming the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## Trading Cryptocurrencies on KuCoin

After depositing fiat or crypto, you can trade on KuCoin.
1.  Go to the "Markets" section on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
2.  Select the desired trading pair. If you deposited USDT, you can find a wide range of cryptocurrencies interchangeable with USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. KuCoin offers a wide variety of crypto assets and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Commissions**:
    *   Base trading commissions are typically 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
    *   Commissions can decrease based on your trading volume and the amount of KuCoin Shares (KCS) you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Holding more KCS or trading higher volumes results in lower maker and taker fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
4.  **Trading Interface**: The interactive trading menu displays:
    *   A price graph for the selected pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
    *   The order book, showing active buy and sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
    *   Recent trade operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
    *   Drawing tools for technical analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
5.  **Security**: You will need to enter a trading verification code, which is set up when creating your account, to execute trades. This prevents unauthorized trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
6.  **Executing Orders**:
    *   **Spot Trading**: Ensure "Spot" is selected, as this is for direct purchases without leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Market Order**: This is the simplest order type, buying or selling immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.
    *   Other order types include Limit, Stop Limit, and Stop orders, which allow you to set specific prices for buying or selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
    *   When placing a market order, you only specify the quantity, not the price, as it executes at the best available current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.
7.  **Transferring Funds to Trading Account**:
    *   Before trading, deposited funds must be transferred from the "Main Account" to the "Trading Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
    *   Go to "Assets," then "Main Account," and select "Transfer" to move funds to the "Trading Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
    *   Once funds are in the trading account, you can proceed to buy cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.
    *   After the transfer, select the percentage of your funds you wish to use (e.g., 100%) and confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

Once the order is successfully placed, the purchased cryptocurrency will appear in your trading account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.

Navigating [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] is essential for managing your channel and accessing various features. This guide outlines how to access and use specific sections of [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] to enable advanced capabilities like uploading longer videos.

## Accessing YouTube Studio

To begin managing your YouTube channel, the first step is to directly access [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] from the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When a new account is created, it initially restricts video uploads to under 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, and may have no videos uploaded yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Navigating Channel Settings

Once inside [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]], follow these steps to access specific channel features:

1.  Go to the "Configuration" (Settings) section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  Within "Configuration," select the "Channel" sub-tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
3.  In the "Channel" section, navigate to "Access to functions" (Feature eligibility) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Channel Features and Verification

The "Access to functions" section categorizes features based on their activation requirements:

*   **Default Functions:** These are enabled by default and include [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | uploading videos]], [[creating_youtube_playlists | creating playlists]], and adding video collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Functions Requiring Phone Verification:** These features are initially available but require phone verification to be enabled. They include:
    *   Videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   Custom thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   Live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

To enable these features, a phone verification process must be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

When attempting to recall or modify an email sent through Outlook, a crucial factor for success is whether the recipient has opened the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Condition for Successful Recall/Modification

For any attempt to [[methods_to_edit_or_remove_sent_emails | edit the message]] or [[how_to_cancel_or_deletesent_emails_in_outlook | delete a sent email]] to be effective, it is "super important" that the recipient has not yet opened the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the email has already been opened, the recall or modification attempt will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Options for Sent Messages

After sending an email, if it is still unopened by the recipient, you have two primary options:
*   [[how_to_cancel_or_delete_sent_emails_in_outlook | Delete the message completely]] so it no longer appears in the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   [[methods_to_edit_or_remove_sent_emails | Delete the original message and send a modified version]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The system can also [[how_to_notify_sender_about_email_recall_success | alert you as the sender]] whether the recall or modification was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

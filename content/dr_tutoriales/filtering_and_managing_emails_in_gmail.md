[[Organizing emails with labels | Organizing emails]] in Gmail using labels is a useful method for managing your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Gmail accounts come with default categories like news, subscriptions, and comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, but custom labels allow for more specific organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Accessing Label Settings

To begin [[creating_labels_in_gmail | creating labels]] and managing them:
1.  Navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Click on the "Settings" icon, usually located on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  From the configuration options, select the "Labels" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Understanding the Labels Window

The "Labels" window displays what appears in the left-hand sidebar of your Gmail inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This includes standard labels like "sent" emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Any labels you create and choose to show will be visible here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Creating New Labels

[[Creating labels in Gmail | Creating new labels]] helps to [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | organize Gmail emails automatically]] by categorizing incoming and existing messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Creating a Main Label
1.  In the "Labels" settings, select "Create new labels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  Assign a name to your label; for example, "YouTube" to group all related emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Creating Nested Labels (Sub-Labels)
You can create sub-labels within main labels, similar to [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | creating email folders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
1.  When creating a new label (e.g., "Comments"), check the "Nest label in" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Select the parent label (e.g., "YouTube") from the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This will place the new label underneath the parent label in your sidebar, indicating it's a sub-category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
3.  Repeat this process for other sub-categories, such as "Subscriptions" under "YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Managing Existing Labels

*   **Deleting a Label:** To remove a label, select it and click the "Delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Modifying a Label:** To change a label's name or other properties, select it and click "Modify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying Labels to Emails

Once labels are created, you can apply them to individual or multiple emails for [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | sorting Gmail inbox]].
1.  Search for emails related to a specific topic or keyword (e.g., "subscription" or "Replay" for comments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  Select all the relevant emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  Right-click on the selected emails, choose "Label as," and then select the appropriate label (e.g., "YouTube/Subscriptions" or "YouTube/Comments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
4.  All selected emails will now be associated with that label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Clicking on a label in the sidebar will display all emails assigned to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

## Visual Organization with Label Colors

To further distinguish your labels, you can assign them specific colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
1.  Go back to the "Labels" settings.
2.  Locate the label you wish to colorize.
3.  Click on the three dots next to the label name and choose a color (e.g., red for "YouTube" and its sub-labels like "Subscriptions" and "Comments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
4.  Emails with these labels will then display the assigned color in your inbox, making them easy to identify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

This method provides a basic but effective way to [[using_filters_in_gmail_to_manage_emails | filter and manage emails]] within Gmail, helping to keep your inbox organized by specific categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

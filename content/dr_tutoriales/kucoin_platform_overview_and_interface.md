KuCoin is presented as a highly attractive and competent cryptocurrency platform, making it worthwhile to analyze all its features step by step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This overview is part of a series of tutorials designed to help users learn how to use the platform comprehensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Interface Layout and Navigation

Upon accessing the KuCoin platform, users will primarily distinguish two main menus: one at the top left and another at the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Top Right Menu: Account and Settings

The top right menu provides access to personal account details and platform settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

#### Account Details
This section displays options related to your account, including language, notifications, API management, and mobile app downloads for iOS and Android <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Users can also view their [[trading_fees_and_commission_structure_at_kucoin | commissions]], assets, and orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

#### [[account_verification_and_security_on_kucoin | Account Verification (KYC)]]
To [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buy or sell cryptocurrencies]] and operate within the platform, users must verify their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This process involves submitting identity documents and taking a photo with the ID for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

#### Account Security
The platform recommends using Google Authenticator for enhanced security, which generates a changing code every 10-15 seconds for login <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. This additional security measure is highly recommended to protect user capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

#### [[trading_fees_and_commission_structure_at_kucoin | Fee Levels and Commission Structure]]
KuCoin offers a relatively low commission structure, with 0.1% for both maker and taker fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These trading fees can decrease further based on the volume of Bitcoin or KCS (KuCoin Shares) held or traded within a 30-day period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. At the highest level (level 12), commissions can even become negative, meaning users are paid to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

#### [[understanding_transaction_fees_on_kucoin | Deposit and Withdrawal Fees]]
*   **Deposits**: KuCoin generally does not charge commissions for deposits, as these fees are usually charged by the external exchange from which cryptocurrencies are sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Withdrawals**: KuCoin charges a commission only when cryptocurrencies are withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. The minimum withdrawal amount and commission vary by cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. For example, withdrawing USDT via KCC charges a 10 cent commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Fiat Money Deposits**: KuCoin itself does not directly accept fiat money deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. When users deposit fiat via credit/debit card or Apple Pay, an external company is involved, which converts the fiat into cryptoassets accepted by KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This process results in higher commissions, sometimes up to 3% of the deposit amount, which is not transparently displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. In contrast, blockchain transfers for cryptocurrencies like USDT often only incur a 10 cent fee regardless of the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Top Left Menu: Platform Features

The top left menu provides access to the core functionalities of the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

#### Markets
This section displays the entire range of cryptocurrencies available on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Cryptocurrencies are categorized by their 24-hour trading volume, with Bitcoin and Ethereum typically at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Users can view all available exchange pairs (e.g., BTC/USDT, ETH/USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. It's crucial to understand that to [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buy a cryptocurrency]], you must have an interchangeable cryptoasset (e.g., USDT to buy Cardano) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

#### [[buying_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | Buying Crypto]]
KuCoin offers several methods to [[buying_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buy cryptocurrencies]]:
*   **Credit/Debit Card (Visa, Mastercard, Apple Pay)**: This method involves external companies, leading to higher, sometimes undisclosed, commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **P2P (Peer-to-Peer)**: Allows users to trade directly with other individuals on the platform, where prices are set by the sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Quick Purchase**: Designed for rapid purchases, but users should be aware of potential hidden fees, as the displayed ratio might not reflect the actual exchange rate due to commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.

#### Trade
This section is where users can execute buy and sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It features charts, order books, open orders, and order history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Spot Market**: Recommended for new users as it involves trading only with owned capital, without leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Margin Market**: Involves operating with leverage (e.g., 10x), which is considered more complex and dangerous for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. It is advised to start with spot trading and gain knowledge before moving to margin or futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

#### Derivatives

This includes products like staking, where users can earn an annual percentage on their crypto holdings in addition to any price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. This is highlighted as one of KuCoin's most interesting features due to its diverse product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

This guide provides steps on how to create and manage email signatures within Outlook, allowing for personalized and professional communication.

## Accessing Signature Settings

To begin [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | creating or modifying signatures]] in Outlook, navigate through the menu options:
1.  Go to the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
2.  Select "Options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
3.  In the Options window, go to the "Mail" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
4.  Look for "Signatures" (or "Signatures" in English) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, which allows you to create or modify them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Creating and Customizing Signatures

Once in the Signatures window:
1.  You can create a new signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  Give your new signature a name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. For example, "Subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  After naming it, click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
4.  You can then write the desired signature content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
5.  Signatures allow you to [[adding_images_and_text_to_email_signatures | import images]] and include text formatted as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. An example might include your name, company logo, email, and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
6.  Once designed, save the signature by clicking "Keep" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Managing Multiple Signatures and Defaults

Outlook allows you to [[managing_multiple_email_signatures_for_different_accounts | manage several email accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> and assign different signatures to each:
*   You can create multiple signatures (e.g., "Subscribe," "Don't know," "Like") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   For each email account, you can configure which signature to use for new messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> and specifically [[configuring_signatures_for_replies_and_forwarded_emails | for replies or forwarded emails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Testing Your Signature

After configuring your signatures:
1.  Click "OK" to apply the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
2.  When you compose a new email, the default signature you set will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
3.  Similarly, when you reply to an email, your configured signature for replies will be inserted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Setting up your email signatures effectively ensures a consistent and professional appearance for all your outgoing communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

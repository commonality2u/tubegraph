This article outlines how to use a mobile application to view and understand the location data embedded within your photos. By following these steps, you can discover where a photo was taken, provided the geolocation feature was enabled on the device that captured the image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Getting Started: The Exif App

To determine a photo's location, you will need a mobile phone and a specific, free application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### Downloading the Application

The recommended application is called **Exif** (also referred to as Xip) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
It can be found in the Apple Store by searching for "Exif, metadata, metadata" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The application typically appears with an orange icon and "photo, video" in its description, with a rating of 4.5 stars from 153 reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Free vs. Pro Options
The Exif application offers both a free and a Pro option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. The free option is sufficient for viewing photo geolocation and metadata <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Using the Exif Application

### Granting Permissions
Upon opening the application, you must allow it to access your photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. You can then select the photos you wish to examine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. [[appspecific_location_permissions | App-specific location permissions]]

### Viewing Photo Metadata and Geolocation
Once photos are imported, the application displays their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Not all mobile phones have geolocation activated when taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This setting can usually be chosen in device permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Some photos will have location data enabled, while others will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

For photos with enabled geolocation, the app will display:
*   Image size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Camera details (e.g., iPhone 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
*   Lens information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
*   Longitude and latitude (coordinates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   The exact location on a map when you click on the map icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

The location provided is typically very exact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. [[examples_and_use_cases_of_photo_geolocation | Examples and use cases of photo geolocation]]

### Examples of Location Data
*   **Photo with Geolocation:** A photo of a bear in Bristol, England, clearly showed coordinates and could be located on a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A photo taken at Niagara Falls accurately displayed its location from Skylon Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Another photo from Oxford also had its location displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
*   **Photo Without Geolocation:** A photo sent from Switzerland did not display any location or metadata because the sender had not enabled location services when taking the picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Managing Photos in the App
You can add more photos to the application by using the plus button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Photos are converted to JPG for display, showing their location and camera details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

> You can close and reopen the app to refresh your view of the photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Important Note on Geolocation Settings
It is crucial to understand that not all mobile phones automatically activate geolocation when photos are taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This setting can often be configured in your device's permissions or location settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

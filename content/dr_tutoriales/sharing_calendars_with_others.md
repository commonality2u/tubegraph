Google Calendar is a tool that allows users to organize their schedule and coordinate with others by sharing calendars. This guide explains [[how_to_use_google_calendar | how to use Google Calendar]] to share personal or created calendars with others, offering both public and private sharing options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Accessing Google Calendar
To access Google Calendar, open a new tab in your web browser and click the "little squares" (Google applications menu) located at the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. From there, select "Calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Calendar View Options
Google Calendar can be viewed by day, week, month, or year, with the month view often recommended for better visualization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Users can also see a list of days on the left side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Pre-existing calendars, such as country-specific holidays, may appear by default but can be hidden if the calendar becomes too busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## [[creating_a_new_calendar_in_google_calendar | Creating a New Calendar]]
To create a new calendar, navigate to "Other calendars" and click the "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Then select "Create a calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. When creating a calendar, you will need to:
*   **Name the calendar**: For example, "Video YouTube Tutorials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Add a description**: Such as "best YouTube tutorials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Verify ownership**: The creator's email will be listed as the owner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

After creation, the new calendar will appear on the left side of the main screen as another calendar option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Customizing Calendar Appearance
Once a calendar is created, its appearance can be customized. Click the three dots next to the calendar name on the left sidebar to edit it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. You can change its color to distinguish it from other calendars, such as changing it to red to represent YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Sharing a Calendar
To share a calendar, click on its three dots and select "Configure and share" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Here, you can determine if invitations are accepted automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The primary options for sharing are public or private:

### Public Sharing
Selecting "Share it publicly" allows all people to access the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This option is useful for calendars with subscribers or for sending out general reminders, like when new videos will be uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Sharing with Specific People (Private Sharing)
To share privately with select individuals:
1.  Go to "Share with certain people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
2.  Click "Add people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  Enter the email address of the person you want to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
4.  Set specific permissions for that person, which include:
    *   Seeing all events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
    *   Making changes to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
    *   Having administrator privileges to manage the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>

Once an invitation is sent, the recipient can access the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This process involves [[managing_events_and_permissions_in_google_calendar | managing events and permissions]] for different users.

### Sharing with Non-Gmail Users
If you want to share a calendar with someone who does not have a Gmail account, you have two primary options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>:
1.  **Share it publicly**: This allows anyone, including those with Yahoo or other email accounts, to view the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Suggest they create a Gmail account**: Creating a Gmail account is simple and typically takes less than five minutes, enabling private sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## [[configuring_calendar_notifications | Configuring Calendar Notifications]]
In addition to sharing, users can [[configuring_calendar_notifications | configure notifications]] for their calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Notifications can be set to alert users about events with a specified lead time, such as ten minutes, ten hours, or four hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Other types of notifications, such as those for canceled events, can also be configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. These notifications are helpful for organizing daily tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Creating an Event on a Shared Calendar
To add an event to a calendar, click on the desired date and select "Add an event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. When creating an event, you can:
*   **Add an event title**: For example, "Video Calendar Tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Specify the date**: Such as April twenty-third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Add guests**: Although not always necessary if the calendar is already shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Add a location or conference details**: For example, "Madrid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Include a description**: Such as "a good tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Assign the event to a specific calendar**: Ensure it is on the correct shared calendar, like "YouTube video tutorials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Once saved, the event will appear on the chosen calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. When this calendar is shared, notifications for the event can be sent to both email and mobile devices, depending on how the recipient has configured their settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

When withdrawing cryptocurrencies or funds from Coinbase to a bank account, it's essential to understand the associated fees to minimize costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Money

Before funds can be withdrawn to a bank, cryptocurrencies must first be converted into fiat money (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This is because cryptocurrencies like Polygon (MATIC) are not considered legal tender that can be directly stored in traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

To convert cryptocurrencies to fiat, users can go to the "operate and sell" section on Coinbase and convert their coins to the desired currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. However, converting within the main Coinbase platform can incur commissions, such as a 1 Euro fee for selling a small amount of MATIC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

To operate with very low commissions during conversion, it is recommended to use [[using_coinbase_and_coinbase_pro_for_transactions | Coinbase Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Withdrawal Methods and Associated Fees

Once cryptocurrencies are converted to fiat money (e.g., Euros), they can be withdrawn to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Coinbase offers different withdrawal methods, each with varying fees:

*   **Debit/Credit Card Withdrawal:** This method is **not recommended** due to high commissions, which can be around 21.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Bank Account Transfer:** Withdrawing to a bank account via transfer typically incurs a very low commission of around 0.15 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Such transfers usually take about one to two days to clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **PayPal:** Withdrawing funds to [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_paypal | PayPal]] is **totally free** of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Transfers to PayPal usually take about one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

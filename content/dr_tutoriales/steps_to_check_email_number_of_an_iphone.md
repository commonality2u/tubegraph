To determine if an iPhone is reported as lost, stolen, or disappeared, you can check its IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number using an online tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process is crucial when purchasing a second-hand device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Understanding the IMEI Number

Every Apple device has an IMEI number, which acts as its unique identification number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. If a device is lost, Apple can register this IMEI number as a lost, disappeared, or stolen device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Checking this number helps prevent the purchase of a compromised device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To check an iPhone's IMEI status, you will need two things:
1.  Access to a specific web page (mentioned as available in the first comment of the source video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
2.  The mobile device you wish to check, in order to retrieve its IMEI number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Locating the IMEI Number on an iPhone

The IMEI number can be found in several locations on an iPhone:
*   On the device's housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   On the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Via Device Settings (for an active iPhone)

1.  Open the **Settings** app on your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Navigate to **General** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
3.  Tap on **Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
4.  Scroll down to find the IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Dual SIM Devices

If an iPhone supports dual SIM cards, it will have an IMEI number associated with each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It's important to understand that a device has one IMEI per SIM slot, not per iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If your device has two IMEIs, you must check both IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### For Locked or Reset Devices

If the device is locked or has been reset and is not currently running applications, you can still find the IMEI. A screenshot would typically illustrate how to find it in this state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Using the Online Verification Tool

Once you have the IMEI number:

1.  Access the specified web page for checking iPhone status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This tool is part of the [[using_online_tools_to_verify_an_iphones_status | using online tools to verify an iPhone's status]].
2.  Copy and paste the IMEI number into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
3.  Check the "I am not a robot" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  Click "Check" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The tool will then report the status of the IMEI, indicating if it's activated, if "Find My iPhone" is on or off, and whether it's listed as stolen or on a "BlackBook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. An activated device with "Find My iPhone" turned off and not on the BlackBook indicates it is not stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

[[conducting_p2p_transactions_on_binance | Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments]] on Binance allow users to exchange cryptocurrencies directly with other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. This method can sometimes offer better rates than direct bank exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>.

## Accessing P2P Trading
To initiate a P2P transaction on Binance:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
2.  Select "P2P Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:08">[00:58:08]</a>.

## Selecting PayPal as a Payment Method
Binance's P2P platform supports various payment methods, with bank transfers and PayPal being among the most commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.

To filter for users willing to transact via PayPal:
1.  On the P2P trading page, locate the "Payment" filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:47">[03:11:47]</a>.
2.  Select "PayPal" from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>. This will display a list of users who are willing to use PayPal for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:40">[03:41:40]</a>.

## Important Considerations When Using PayPal on P2P
When [[buying and selling cryptocurrencies on Binance | buying or selling cryptocurrencies]] via P2P using PayPal, several factors should be taken into account:

### Price and Commission
Always check the price of the cryptocurrency being offered or requested against the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>. Some users, including those offering PayPal as a payment option, may list prices significantly different from the market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>. For example, a Bitcoin might be offered at 36,000 euros via PayPal when the market price is 27,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>. This emphasizes the importance of comparing prices before confirming a purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:04">[03:56:04]</a>.

### User Rating and Reliability
A crucial aspect of P2P transactions is the rating of each user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>. This rating reflects:
*   The number of P2P transactions they have completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:45">[04:11:45]</a>.
*   The percentage of those transactions that were completed satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:30">[04:13:30]</a>.

After a transaction, users can rate each other based on speed, ease, and whether payment was made correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:34">[04:17:34]</a>. It is important to note that non-completion of an order does not always mean an issue; it could be due to recent timing or other reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>. When choosing a counterparty, consider their total orders and completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:07">[04:57:07]</a>.

### Transaction Process and Timelines
When you agree to a transaction, a pop-up window will open showing details such as the maximum and minimum amounts you can transact, and the amount of cryptocurrency you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. The seller will specify the payment method (e.g., bank transfer or PayPal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:04">[07:47:04]</a>, and there will be a time limit (e.g., 45-55 minutes) within which the transfer must be completed by both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:05">[07:49:05]</a>.

## Preparing Your Funds for P2P Trading
Before you can [[how_to_sell_bitcoin_on_binance | sell Bitcoin on Binance]] or other cryptocurrencies via P2P, you need to transfer the desired capital to your P2P wallet:
1.  Go to your wallet section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:46">[05:35:46]</a>.
2.  Transfer the cryptocurrency you wish to trade from your Fiat and Spot wallet to your P2P wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:01">[05:49:01]</a>.
3.  To do this, select "Transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:15">[06:22:15]</a>, choose "Fiat and Spot" as the source wallet and "P2P Wallet" as the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>, enter the amount, and confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Once transferred, the funds will appear in your P2P wallet and are ready for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:20">[06:47:20]</a>.

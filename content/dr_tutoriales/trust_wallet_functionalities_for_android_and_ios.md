Trust Wallet is a cryptocurrency application designed to be used on mobile devices, including both Android and iOS operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The application offers identical functionalities across both platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Getting Started with Trust Wallet

To begin using Trust Wallet, users must first download the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Upon opening the app, users are presented with two options: [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | import an existing wallet]] or [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | create a new one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Wallet Creation and Import
*   **Creating a New Wallet**: For new users, a new wallet can be created by accepting the privacy policy and setting up an access code (password) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. A crucial step involves making a copy of the wallet's 12-word secret phrase (also known as a recovery phrase or seed phrase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. It is strongly recommended to copy this phrase onto physical paper, as digital copies (e.g., on a PC) are vulnerable to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Users must acknowledge that losing this phrase will result in permanent loss of funds, and sharing it can lead to theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. After copying, the phrase needs to be entered in the correct order for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Importing an Existing Wallet**: Users who already possess a wallet simply need to import their recovery phrase (the words in the correct order) and set their password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Once successfully created or imported, the wallet is ready for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Core Wallet Features

Upon entering the wallet interface, users can see options for notifications and view the accepted cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### [[buying_sending_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies_using_trust_wallet | Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrencies]]
Trust Wallet allows users to send and receive various cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

It is crucial to note the specific blockchain (e.g., BNB Chain) that the address accepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Sending**: While the sending option is available, it requires funds in the wallet to be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### [[buying_sending_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies_using_trust_wallet | Buying and Swapping Cryptocurrencies]]

This process typically involves opening a third-party page and making a card payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Swapping (Exchange)**: The "swap" functionality allows users to exchange one cryptocurrency for another within the wallet, utilizing the best available market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

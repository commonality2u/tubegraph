Compressing video files is useful for [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reducing video file size for easier transfer]], such as for sending via WhatsApp or email, or to save memory on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The goal is to reduce file size without losing quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Tool Required: VLC Player

To [[video_compression_using_vlc | compress videos using VLC]], you will need the VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. VLC is primarily used to open and play video files, but it also offers editing capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Here's a [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | simple steps for downloading videos without losing quality]] while compressing:

1.  **Open with VLC**: Open the video file you wish to compress with VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Access Convert Option**: In VLC, navigate to "Medio" (Media) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> and select "Convert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Add File**: On the conversion screen, click "Add" to select the video file you want to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Conversion**: Click the "Convert / Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Careful configuration is crucial to maintain video quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

*   **Profile**: Select "H.264 + MP3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Encapsulation**: Set to "MP4/MOV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Video Codec**:
    *   Codec: H.264 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    *   Bitrate: Unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   Quality: Same as source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Resolution**: Set the scale to "1" for optimal quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, with height and width on automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Filters**: Do not apply any filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Audio**: It is recommended to keep the audio as "original audio" to prevent audio loss during conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## [[exporting_and_saving_compressed_video_files | Exporting and Saving Compressed Video Files]]

After configuring the settings, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Choose the export location and provide a name for the compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

The compression process will begin, indicated by a loading bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Once the bar reaches the end, the video will be fully converted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Results of Compression

A video originally weighing 1.93 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a> (an HD chapter with multiple audio tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>) can be reduced to 384 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This represents a reduction of more than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The audio should play, and the quality should remain relatively good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

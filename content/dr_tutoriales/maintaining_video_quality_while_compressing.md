This guide explains how to compress videos for services like WhatsApp while aiming to [[retaining_video_quality | retain video quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:33">[02:47:33]</a>. Not all videos can be sent without compression due to capacity limits imposed by messaging applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Recommended [[video_compression_tools_available_in_app_stores | Video Compression Tool]]

To begin the [[step_by_step_video_compression_tutorial | video compression tutorial]], a specific application is recommended:
1.  **Access the App Store**: Go to your device's app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Search for "Video Compressor"**: Type "Video Compressor" into the search bar exactly as written <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Select the Recommended App**: While a list of options may appear, the most useful one is identified as having less advertising and fewer payment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.
4.  **Download and Install**: Download the recommended application to your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_video_compression_tutorial | Step-by-Step Video Compression]] Process

Once the "Video Compressor" application is installed, follow these steps to compress a video:
1.  **Open the Application**: Launch the "Video Compressor" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Select "Compress a Video"**: Choose the option to compress a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.
3.  **Choose a Video**: Navigate to your video gallery and select the video you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. For example, a three-minute video originally 34.6 megabytes was used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
4.  **Set Compression Index**: The application provides "indices of compression" which indicate how much the video will be compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
    *   A percentage represents the size relative to the original <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. For instance, an 85% setting reduced a 34.6 megabyte video to 29.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.
    *   The goal is to reduce the size of the video while still [[retaining_video_quality | maintaining quality limits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
    *   The compression can be done automatically via "normal mode" or manually via "advanced mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   A 70% compression setting was used as an example, resulting in approximately a 10 megabyte reduction from the original file size, considered a good balance for [[retaining_video_quality | quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
5.  **Start Compression**: Tap "Compress" to begin the [[video_conversion_process | process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. Compression typically takes about 20-30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
6.  **Save the Compressed Video**: Once compressed, the video can be saved to your device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. This allows you to view the compressed video alongside the original to [[comparing_video_compression_options | compare quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

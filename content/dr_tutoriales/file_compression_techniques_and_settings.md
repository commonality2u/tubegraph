File compression is a process used to reduce the size of files, making them easier to transport and share, particularly via email where size limits often apply, such as Gmail's 25MB limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This allows for sending a greater number of files in a single email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Using WinRAR for File Compression

WinRAR is a program that facilitates both file [[compressing_files_using_winrar | compression]] and decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Obtaining WinRAR

To obtain WinRAR, access a trusted search engine (e.g., Google Chrome) and search for "winrar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The first search result typically allows for downloading the program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Pre-Compression File Size Check

Before compressing, you can [[checking_compressed_file_size | check the original file size]]. Right-click the file, select "Properties," and view its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For example, a video file weighing 55.6 megabytes would be too large to transfer via Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Steps to [[compressing_files_using_winrar | Compress a File with WinRAR]]

1.  **Select the file:** Once WinRAR is installed, right-click on the file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Add to archive:** From the context menu, select the option that appears as a book icon, usually "Add to file..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
3.  **Configure compression settings:**
    *   **Archive name:** Set the desired name for the compressed file (e.g., "test 1.rar"). The ".rar" extension signifies it is compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   **[[comparison_of_compression_settings | Compression method]]:** Choose "Best" for the highest compression ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   **Dictionary size:** Set to "smallest possible" for further optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   **Split to volumes:** Set to "zero" if not dividing the file into multiple parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   **Compression options:** Select "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Password (optional):** A password can be set for the compressed file if encryption is desired, but this is not mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   **Advanced options:** No changes are generally needed in the advanced settings for typical compression tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
4.  **Execute compression:** Click "Accept" to start the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The time taken depends on the file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Post-Compression File Size Check

After compression, right-click the new `.rar` file and select "Properties" to [[checking_compressed_file_size | check its new size]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. In the example, a 55.6 MB video was compressed to 43.9 MB, achieving approximately 20% compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Other Compression Methods

While WinRAR is effective, other methods exist for specific file types. For instance, [[vlc_settings_for_compressing_videos | VLC Media Player]] can be used for video compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

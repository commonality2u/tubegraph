This article provides a guide on how to list the USDT token within a Metamask account, making it available for use and conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The process is similar for both computer and mobile phone platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you have already logged into your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. If you do not yet have a Metamask account or are unfamiliar with its use, a separate [[tutorial_resources_for_binance_transactions | tutorial]] resource is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Locating the USDT Contract Address

To add the USDT token, you need its contract address. This can be found on a specific web page that lists cryptocurrencies and their contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The link to this platform is typically provided in the first comment of associated video tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the specified web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
2.  In the search engine, enter "USDT" or "CECER" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  Open the search result that corresponds to USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This page will display the USDT contract and potentially a Metamask fox icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Methods to Add USDT to Metamask

There are two primary methods to add the USDT token once you have located its contract address:

### Method 1: Manual Addition

This method involves copying the contract address and manually pasting it into Metamask:

1.  On the contract address page, copy the USDT contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  Open your Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  Go to the section for adding tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
4.  Paste the copied contract address into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
5.  Metamask should automatically recognize the token as USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
6.  Confirm the addition, and the USDT token will appear in your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Method 2: Automatic Addition via Metamask Fox Icon

If the Metamask extension is installed, you can add the token automatically:

1.  On the USDT contract address page, click on the Metamask fox icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  A Metamask notification tab will open, indicating that it is loading the token information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
3.  Once loaded, you can add the token to your Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
4.  After refreshing your Metamask page, the USDT token should appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Listing USDT

By successfully listing the USDT token in your Metamask account, you can use it to [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | convert cryptocurrencies]] and withdraw them as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This process of [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | importing the USDT token]] is straightforward and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

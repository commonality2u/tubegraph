## Compressing PDFs with I Love PDF

The primary function demonstrated is PDF compression, which helps reduce the file's size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Steps to Compress a PDF

1.  **Select "Compress PDF"**: From the main interface, choose the "Compress PDF" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
2.  **Upload File**: Click to select the PDF file from your computer. For example, a "Fati Case Study" PDF weighing approximately 7.82 megabytes was used in a demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
3.  **Choose Compression Level**: I Love PDF offers different compression options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>:
    *   **Extreme Compression**: Achieves the smallest file size but may significantly reduce quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
    *   **Recommended Compression**: Balances file size reduction with quality preservation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   **Low Compression**: Offers the least reduction in file size but maintains the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

    The more a file is compressed, the lower its quality will be, as the process involves sacrificing aspects like image resolution, video quality, and text clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Compression**: After selecting your preferred compression level (e.g., "Recommended"), click the "Compress PDF" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
5.  **Monitor Progress**: The tool will display upload progress, remaining time, and upload speed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
6.  **Download Compressed File**: Once the compression is complete, the screen will show the percentage of reduction and the new file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For instance, a 7.82 MB file was reduced by 78% to 1.76 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The new PDF can then be downloaded directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Post-Compression Review

After downloading, you can open the compressed PDF to check its quality. For documents primarily consisting of text and some images, often not much quality is lost, even with significant compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Verifying the new file size in your downloads confirms the reduction (e.g., 1.75 megabytes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It's possible to reduce a PDF by up to 75% or more, depending on the chosen quality settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Greater reduction is achievable by selecting "Extreme compression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Several online translation tools are available that allow users to translate documents. The video demonstrates three such services to [[methods_to_translate_a_pdf_document | translate a PDF document]], including [[translating_documents_with_google_translate | Google Translate]] and DeepL (referred to as "tips l translator"). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a> These tools allow users to translate files such as Word, PowerPoint, and PDF documents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>

## Free Translation Services

### [[translating_documents_with_google_translate | Google Translate]]
[[translating_documents_with_google_translate | Google Translate]] is highlighted as a completely free online service for document translation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a> It does not require a "Pro" subscription and has no apparent limitations on document length or character count for translation as demonstrated in the video. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>

### DeepL (Free Version)
The free version of DeepL (referred to as "tips l translator" and "the Word" in the transcript) also allows for document translation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> However, the free version has a character limit, meaning it can only translate shorter documents. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>

## Paid Translation Services

### DeepL Pro
To translate longer documents or to edit translated documents using DeepL, users are prompted to subscribe to "Deepl Pro." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> This indicates that DeepL offers a paid subscription service for enhanced features and higher usage limits, in contrast to the free version's restrictions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>

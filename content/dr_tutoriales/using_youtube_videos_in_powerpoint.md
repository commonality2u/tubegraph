PowerPoint presentations can be enhanced by [[importing_videos_into_powerpoint | importing videos]], allowing for a dynamic viewing experience during the presentation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. When adding a video, a new slide can be created specifically for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## How to Add Videos to PowerPoint

To add a video to a PowerPoint slide:
1.  Navigate to the "Insert" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Video" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  PowerPoint offers two main options for video insertion:
    *   Online Video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
    *   Video from My PC (or "Video of the pp") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>

Both types of videos can be viewed directly within the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | Inserting Online Videos]] (e.g., YouTube)

To embed a YouTube video directly from the internet:
1.  Select the "Online Video" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  Obtain the URL (link) of the desired YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
3.  Paste the URL into the provided field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
4.  Click "Insert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. The video will then be ready for direct viewing within the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

**Important Note:** For [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | online videos]], an active internet connection is required for the video to be visible and playable during the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If there is no Wi-Fi, online YouTube videos cannot be viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### [[adding_videos_from_a_computer_to_powerpoint | Adding Videos from a Computer]]

If you wish to include a video file stored locally on your computer (which might include a downloaded YouTube video):
1.  Go to the "Insert" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  Select "Video" and then "Video on My PC" (or "Video Computer") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  Browse your computer to locate and select the desired video file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
4.  Click "Insert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

**Key Difference:** Unlike [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | online videos]], a video inserted from your computer does not require an internet connection to be viewed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. These videos can also be configured with specific playback options, such as starting automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

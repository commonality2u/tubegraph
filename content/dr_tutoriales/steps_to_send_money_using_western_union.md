This article provides a [[stepbystep_guide_for_money_transfer_process | step-by-step guide for money transfer process]] using the [[western_union_money_transfer_tutorial | Western Union online platform]] to send money internationally in a simple and easy way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Accessing the Platform
The [[western_union_money_transfer_tutorial | Western Union tutorial video]] demonstrates the process using the computer platform, but it is also possible to use the mobile application, which is very user-friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## Sending Money Options
Upon entering the Western Union platform (e.g., from Spain), users are presented with options to send money to various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### Calculation of Price and Fees
It is possible to calculate the price and see the charges depending on the destination country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For example, sending 100 euros from Spain to the USA, the recipient might receive 104.14 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The maximum amount that can be sent is up to 3,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Recipient and Sender Methods
There's a significant difference between sending money "online" and "to person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Recipient's method**: The recipient can receive money either in cash or via bank transfer (online) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Sender's payment method**: Payments can be made via credit/debit card or bank wire transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Sending money always has to be done online, not in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### [[understanding_western_unions_fees_and_exchange_rates | Understanding Western Union's Fees and Exchange Rates]]
While the platform might show "zero euros" for the transfer fee, it is important to compare the exchange rate with real-time currency conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For instance, 100 euros might convert to 106.68 USD in real-time, but Western Union might offer 104.14 USD, indicating they retain a portion through the exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Furthermore, Western Union may charge a higher hidden commission when the recipient opts to receive money in cash compared to a bank account transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. For example, receiving cash might result in 4 USD less than a bank account transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is a point the platform does not explicitly mention, but it remains a cheap platform for international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Transfer Times
*   **Credit/Debit Card**: Transfers typically arrive in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Bank Account**: Transfers usually take one business day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
*   **Cash Pickup**: If cash is chosen for the recipient, it arrives in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Completing the Transaction
1.  **Account Access/Creation**: Users must either log in to an existing account or create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Account creation involves providing name, surname, and email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
2.  **Fraud Prevention**: Western Union advises against sending money for reasons like online purchases, anti-terrorism, or lottery winnings to prevent fraud, and suggests using services only for friends and family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
3.  **Recipient Details**: After selecting the payment method, enter the recipient's data, including their bank account details if applicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. It's also necessary to specify the purpose of the transaction, the origin of the money, and the relationship with the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
4.  **Review and Confirmation**: Review all transfer details, including commissions and recipient data, then confirm the transaction. A receipt will be provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

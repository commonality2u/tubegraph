This guide details the process of [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing capital]] from [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] to a bank account safely and reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The process involves two main steps, as a direct withdrawal from [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] to a bank account is not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Overview of the Withdrawal Process

To withdraw funds from [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] to a bank account, an intermediary centralized exchange is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. The two-step process is as follows:
1.  **Transfer from [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] to a Centralized Exchange**: Your cryptocurrency will be moved from your [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] wallet to an account on a centralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.
2.  **Withdraw from Centralized Exchange to Bank Account**: Once your funds are on the exchange, you can convert them to fiat currency (like EUR, USD) and then [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdraw]] to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

The tutorial focuses on performing these steps using a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## Choosing a Centralized Exchange

Many centralized exchanges can serve as intermediaries, including:
*   [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Coinbase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>
*   [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>
*   [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_kucoin_to_a_bank_account | KuCoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>
*   Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>
*   Crypto.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>

The chosen exchange must allow SEPA transfers (or equivalent bank transfers) from its platform to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] is used as an example in this guide due to its SEPA transfer capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Kraken or [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Coinbase]] are also good options, with [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_bank_account | Coinbase]] offering free withdrawals, whereas [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] may charge a small fee (e.g., one euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Referral links for these platforms, which may offer bonuses, are available in the first comment of the original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Bank Account Requirements

Not all traditional bank accounts (e.g., Santander, BBVA) accept withdrawals from centralized exchanges, and transactions may be blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. It is highly recommended to use neobanks that are more accustomed to these types of transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. Recommended neobanks include:
*   Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>
*   N26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>

Video tutorials explaining how to use these neobanks are available in the first comment of the original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Step-by-Step: Transferring from MetaMask to Binance

### 1. Open MetaMask and Identify Assets
*   Open the [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] app on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

Ensure you have a small amount of the native blockchain token (e.g., BNB for BNB Smart Chain) to cover gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

### 2. Obtain Deposit Address from Binance

*   Paste the copied deposit address from [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.
*   Choose the cryptocurrency to send (e.g., USDT) and enter the amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
*   Review the gas fees, which will be paid in the native token of the blockchain (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>.
*   Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   Wait for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. The balance should disappear from [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   You can check the transaction history in [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] under "Activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

### 4. Verify Deposit on Binance
*   Return to the [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Step-by-Step: Withdrawing from Binance to Bank Account

Once your capital is on the [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] platform, you can proceed to [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdraw]] it to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### 1. Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat
*   From the [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] homepage, navigate to **Trading Markets** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.
*   Select **Convert** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

### 2. Initiate Fiat Withdrawal

    *   **Bank Transfer (SEPA)**: This method typically incurs a small fee (e.g., one euro on [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Bank Card**: This method may charge a higher commission (e.g., 1.8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
*   Select the fiat currency you wish to [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdraw]] (e.g., Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

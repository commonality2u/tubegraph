Advcash is an electronic or digital wallet platform designed for managing capital online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Opening and maintaining an Advcash account is free for both personal and business users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The platform emphasizes payment security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Account Verification

For an Advcash account to be fully operational and allow transactions like deposits or withdrawals, it must be verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

The verification process involves:
*   Scanning an ID or passport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   Performing a verification from a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

This verification is a crucial first step after [[creating_and_managing_an_advcash_account | account creation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Without it, the account remains inoperative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Security Settings

Advcash provides several security features to protect user accounts:
*   **Two-Factor Authentication (2FA)**: Users can enable double authentication via Google Authenticator, email, or mobile phone to enhance account security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This feature is covered in the [[creating_and_managing_an_advcash_account | account creation tutorial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Password Management**: Users can change their account password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Transaction Limits

For deposits, Advcash has specific limits:
*   **Daily Limit**: Up to 10,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Monthly Limit**: Up to 30,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Yearly Limit**: Up to 30,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

These limits can be increased by contacting customer support and providing additional documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It is important for users to follow the platform's rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Account Deletion

Users have the option to delete their Advcash account. This can be done by navigating to the "verification" section, then "profile," and selecting the account deletion option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

**Important Note**: Before deleting an Advcash account, it is critical to withdraw all funds, as any remaining money will be lost permanently upon deletion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

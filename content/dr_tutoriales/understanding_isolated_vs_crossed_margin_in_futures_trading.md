When operating within the futures section of a mobile trading application, traders can choose between two margin modes: Crossed Margin and Isolated Margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This selection is crucial as it determines how losses are managed in relation to your overall asset balance.

## Crossed Margin Mode

In **Crossed Margin** mode, all orders under this mode share the same asset balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. If a position faces liquidation, all assets in kind within that balance, along with any remaining open positions, can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

### Risk Implications
If you operate with [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]] in Crossed Margin mode, losses can intersect with your entire wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. This means if you lose more than the capital allocated to your futures ticket, funds from your other wallets may be used to cover the losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Isolated Margin Mode

In **Isolated Margin** mode, the margin assigned to a position is restricted to a certain, defined amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

### Risk Implications
If the specified margin quantity is exceeded, only that particular position is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. This approach eliminates the associated risk of losing more money than what is specifically held in your futures wallet for that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Recommendation
It is generally recommended to work in Isolated Margin mode to mitigate the risk of losing more capital than allocated to a specific trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.

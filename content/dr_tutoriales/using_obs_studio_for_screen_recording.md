OBS Studio is a program primarily used for recording computer screens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The tutorial video itself is recorded using OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Purpose of using OBS Studio for Video Editing
OBS Studio can be used as a method to save videos edited in programs like Filmora 10 without the application's watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Instead of exporting the file directly from the video editor (which would include the watermark), OBS Studio records the video as it plays on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## How to Record with OBS Studio

### Preparation
1.  Download and open OBS Studio on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
2.  Open the video editing software (e.g., Filmora 10) with your edited video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Ensure the video within the editor is ready to play from the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Recording Process
1.  Within OBS Studio, select the specific screen you intend to record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example, if your video editor is on a separate screen, choose that screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
2.  Maximize the window of the video editor to fill the screen that OBS Studio is capturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This ensures the recording captures the full video playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  Initiate the recording in OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
4.  Play the video within your video editor. OBS Studio will record both the visual content of the screen and the accompanying audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

By following these [[screen_recording_techniques | screen recording techniques]], you can obtain a video file without the original editing software's watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

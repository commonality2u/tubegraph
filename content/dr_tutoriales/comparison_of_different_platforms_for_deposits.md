## [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Depositing on Binance]]

Binance offers two primary ways to deposit funds:
1.  **Fiat Deposits**: This involves depositing national currencies like Euro, Dollar, or Pound Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Methods and Fees**:
        *   Visa/MC Bank Card: Fees can be high, e.g., 1.8% for Euro and Pound Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
        *   P2P Bank Transfer: 0% commission (though additional fees may apply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
        *   Wallet Make Cash: 0% commission (additional fees may apply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
        *   SWIFT Bank Transfer (for USD): Recently enabled with 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
    *   **Method Availability**: Deposit methods can vary depending on the currency chosen and current regulations. Some methods like SEPA transfers and rapid payments have been temporarily suspended in certain countries due to regulatory reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **Cryptocurrency Deposits**: Users can directly deposit cryptocurrencies into Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The cost of these deposits depends on the blockchain network used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

**Recommendation**: When creating a Binance account, using a referral link can provide a 10% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, and deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## [[methods_for_reducing_deposit_fees_on_binance | Alternative Platforms for Economical Deposits]]

If direct fiat deposits on Binance incur high fees, an alternative strategy is to deposit fiat into another platform with lower or zero fees, convert it to a low-cost cryptocurrency, and then [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms | transfer that cryptocurrency]] to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### Kraken
Kraken is an exchange where SEPA transfers might be enabled, allowing for free fiat deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   **Fiat Deposit Cost**: SEPA deposits typically have 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. These deposits usually take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Conversion Cost**: Converting euros to a cryptocurrency on Kraken can cost around 0.16% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. For example, converting 2,000 euros would cost 3.2 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.

        *   Sending Tron (TRX) from Kraken to Binance might cost approximately 10 cents (USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Example Cost Calculation (Kraken to Binance via Tron)**:
        *   Fiat deposit on Kraken: 0 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

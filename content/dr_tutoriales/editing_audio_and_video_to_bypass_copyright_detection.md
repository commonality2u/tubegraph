This article outlines techniques for editing video and audio content, such as fragments of series, films, and anime, to prevent them from being blocked or banned on YouTube due to copyright infringement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. YouTube may block videos due to copyrighted audio (music, voices) or images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. While some videos might be monetized, others can be blocked or banned from public view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Software Used

The video tutorial uses [[using_video_editing_software_to_modify_video_content | Filmora 9]], a [[using_video_editing_software_to_modify_video_content | video editing program]], to modify content before [[uploading_anime_content_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | uploading to YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Video Editing Techniques

To modify the visual content and avoid copyright detection, the following strategies are employed:

*   **Adding a Channel Logo/Watermark** The first step is to place a channel logo with the channel's name over the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This logo should be present throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This modification helps retouch the video's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Applying Visual Effects** Effects provided by the [[using_video_editing_software_to_modify_video_content | editing program]] can be added, such as a "leak of light" effect, which alters the video's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Adding a Border** A border can be added around the video. This can be customized in terms of color (e.g., blue below, white above) and effect (e.g., blurred) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The size of the video within the border can also be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   **Continuous Modifications** Ensuring that these visual modifications (logo, border) are present throughout the entire video is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This technique, which keeps the screen complete with a border and logo, helps prevent YouTube from tracking the video's copyright through its images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Audio Editing Techniques

Modifying the audio is also essential to bypass copyright detection:

*   **Adjusting Volume** When a video is imported into [[using_video_editing_software_to_modify_video_content | Filmora 9]], it comes with a default sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The key is to reduce the original video's volume slightly from its default "zero" level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This modification prevents YouTube from detecting original audio peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. The audio will still be audible without issues, but it has been modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Exporting and Uploading

After applying both image and audio modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, the video is exported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The edited video, with its modified sound, logo, and frame, can then be [[uploading_anime_content_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | uploaded to YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. After processing, the video should appear with [[video_visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | public visibility and no restrictions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

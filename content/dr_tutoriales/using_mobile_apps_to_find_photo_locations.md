This article outlines how to use a free mobile application to view the location data associated with photos, assuming the photo has geolocation enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## App Requirements and Download

To find photo locations, you will need a mobile phone and a free application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

### The Exif App
The recommended application is called **Xip** or **Exif** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Availability**: It can be found in the Apple Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Search Term**: Search for "Exif, meta data" to find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   **Identification**: The app icon is orange and displays "photo, video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. It typically has 153 reviews and a 4.5-star rating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
*   **Cost**: A free version is available and is sufficient for this purpose, though a Pro option also exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## How to Use the Exif App

1.  **Grant Access**: Upon opening the app, the first step is to allow it access to your photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Select Photos**: Choose the specific photos you wish to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. You can add photos to the app by clicking the plus button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **View Metadata**: The app displays [[understanding_photo_metadata_and_geolocation | data from your photos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This includes:
    *   Image size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
    *   Camera aperture and lens details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
    *   Longitude and latitude (coordinates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
    *   Camera details (e.g., iPhone 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>
4.  **Map View**: Clicking on the map within the app will show the exact location where the photo was taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
5.  **Editing Metadata**: The app also offers the capability to [[analyzing_and_editing_photo_metadata | edit the photo's location data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Important Note on Geolocation
It's crucial to understand that not all mobile phones [[enabling_and_disabling_photo_geolocation | have geolocation activated]] when taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This setting can be managed within your phone's permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, often found in [[managing_location_settings_for_individual_apps_on_iphone | location services settings for individual apps]]. If geolocation is not enabled, the app will not display location information for that specific photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For example, a photo taken during a lecture in Switzerland did not display location information because the sender did not have location enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Conversely, photos taken at Niagara Falls or in Bristol, where geolocation was enabled, clearly showed their precise locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

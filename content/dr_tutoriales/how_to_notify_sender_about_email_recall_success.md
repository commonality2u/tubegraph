When recalling an email in Outlook, it is possible for the sender to be notified about the success or failure of the recall attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Recall Process Overview

To initiate a recall or modification of a sent email in Outlook, follow these general steps:
1.  Navigate to your "Sent Messages" folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
2.  Select the email you wish to recall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  Click on the relevant button, which has a specific symbol, to open the recall options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
4.  You will typically be presented with two main options:
    *   **Delete the message completely:** This aims to make the message disappear from the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   [[methods_to_edit_or_remove_sent_emails | Delete it and send another modification]]: This allows you to delete the original email and replace it with an updated version, for instance, if you forgot to add a closing remark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Key Condition for Successful Recall

It is crucial that the recipient **has not opened the message** for the recall to be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the email has already been opened, the recall attempt will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Receiving Confirmation of Recall Attempt

Outlook provides a mechanism to alert the sender whether the recall or modification has been successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. When attempting a recall, you can choose to be notified about its outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

After initiating the recall, you will receive confirmation detailing the attempt, such as the date and time it was made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This confirmation will indicate if the message was "totally eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to send money using the Western Union platform, covering both online and mobile app methods, fee calculations, and recipient options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Accessing the Platform

The tutorial focuses on using the Western Union platform on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. However, it's also possible to perform transfers using the Western Union mobile app, which is described as very simple to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Sending Money Overview

When using the Western Union platform, the first step is to select the destination country. The platform, when accessed from Spain, defaults to Spanish settings and provides options to send money to many different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Key features and considerations when sending money include:
*   **Calculating Price**: An important feature is the ability to calculate the price and see the fees charged based on the destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   **Recipient Method**: There's a significant difference between sending money "online" (to a bank account) and sending it "to a person" (for cash pickup) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The recipient can receive money either in cash or via bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Cost Calculation Example: Spain to USA

Using an example of sending 100 Euros from Spain to the USA:
*   The maximum amount that can be sent is up to 3,000 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Initially, the platform might show "zero euros" for the transfer fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   For 100 Euros sent, the recipient would receive 104.14 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   However, comparing this with the real-time exchange rate (e.g., Euro to Dollar), 100 Euros would typically convert to around 106.68 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This indicates that Western Union retains a portion (in this case, 2.54 USD) through the exchange rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This hidden fee via the exchange rate is a negative point not explicitly mentioned by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Payment and Receipt Methods

*   **Recipient's Options**: The recipient can choose to receive the money in cash or directly into a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Sender's Options**: The sender can pay using a credit or debit card, or via a bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The sender's payment method will always be online, not in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Impact on Exchange Rate**: The exchange rate can change depending on how the money is received. If the recipient chooses to receive cash, the exchange rate can increase, resulting in the recipient receiving less money (e.g., 4 USD less for 100 Euros) compared to a bank account transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Transfer Times

*   **Credit/Debit Card**: Transfers made via credit or debit card typically arrive in minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   **Bank Account**: Transfers to a bank account usually take one business day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Account Creation and Transaction Process

To initiate a transfer, users must either log in to an existing account or create a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  **Account Creation**: Users create a profile with their name, surname, and email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
2.  **Fraud Prevention**: Western Union advises using its services only to send money to friends and family, and not to transfer money for reasons like online purchases, lottery winnings, or job offers, due to fraud risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. A phone number is provided for those who suspect they are victims of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
3.  **Recipient Details**: After selecting the payment method, the sender must enter the recipient's details, including bank account information (if sending to a bank account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
4.  **Transaction Purpose**: Senders must specify the purpose of the transaction, the origin of the money, and their relationship with the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
5.  **Review and Confirmation**: Before finalizing, users can review the entire transfer details, including commissions and recipient data, and then confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. A receipt is provided upon confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Tracking Transfers

Users can [[steps_to_send_money_using_western_union | track their transfer]] from the Western Union platform using the serial number associated with each transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This allows for tracking without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

## My Western Union Program

Western Union offers a loyalty program called "My Western Union" or "My W" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This program rewards users with points for making transfers, which can lead to benefits like reduced commissions and other perks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Users need a "My Western Union" number, provided upon account verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

## Referral Program

Western Union also has a [[western_union_rewards_and_referral_programs | referral program]] where users can earn rewards for inviting friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   If a new user opens an account via a referral link, they can receive an electronic gift code worth up to $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   A requirement for the referred person is to send at least $100 from the US or another country within 30 days of creating their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Conclusion

Western Union is recommended for international money transfers due to its generally low commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. While the platform may not explicitly show all fees, it offers various methods for sending (credit card, bank account) and receiving money (cash, bank account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

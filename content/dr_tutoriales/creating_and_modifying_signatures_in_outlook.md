This guide outlines the process for creating and modifying email signatures within Outlook. The steps are applicable whether Outlook is in English or Spanish, as the interface is exactly the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Accessing Signature Settings

To begin, navigate to the signature settings in Outlook:
1.  Go to the menu located at the top of the Outlook interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
2.  Select "Options" from the available choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
3.  Within the Options menu, find and click on the "Mail" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
4.  Look for the "Signatures" or "Signatures" (in English) option, which allows you to create or modify signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Creating a New Signature

Once in the Signatures window, you can create a new email signature:
1.  Click the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
2.  Provide a name for your new signature, for example, "Subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  Click "OK" to confirm the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

After naming your signature, you can begin to design its content:
*   You can [[adding_images_and_text_to_email_signatures | import images]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   You can [[adding_images_and_text_to_email_signatures | add text]] and format it as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   An example signature might include your name, a company logo, email, and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Saving and Configuring Signatures

Once you have designed your signature, it's important to save it and configure its usage:
1.  Click "Save" (or "Keep") to store your signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
2.  Choose the default signature to be used for your email account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### [[managing_multiple_email_signatures_for_different_accounts | Managing Multiple Email Signatures for Different Accounts]]

Outlook allows you to configure different signatures based on your email accounts:
*   You can select which email account the signature applies to, especially if you have [[managing_multiple_email_signatures_for_different_accounts | several email accounts]] configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   You can [[managing_multiple_email_signatures_for_different_accounts | create multiple signatures]] for different purposes (e.g., "Subscribe," "Give a Like") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### [[configuring_signatures_for_replies_and_forwarded_emails | Configuring Signatures for Replies and Forwarded Emails]]

You can specify how signatures are used for various message types:
*   **New messages**: Set a default signature to appear in all new emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Replies/Forwards**: Decide if the signature should be included in replies or forwarded emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. You can choose a different signature or opt not to use one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

After making your selections, click "OK" in both the signature configuration window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> and the main Options window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> to apply the changes.

## Verifying Signature Implementation

To confirm your signature is correctly set up:
*   **New Email**: Create a new email, and your defined signature should automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Reply**: Reply to an existing email, and if configured, your signature will be present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

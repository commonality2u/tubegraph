When withdrawing funds from Binance to a bank account, choosing the right method can significantly reduce fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>:

*   **Bank Transfer:** This method typically has a commission of 0.8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. While it may take one to two business days for funds to be deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, the savings on commissions, especially for larger amounts, are considerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. The maximum amount for a single bank transfer is 50,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The minimum withdrawal amount for bank transfers is 3 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   **Bank Card:** While faster, with transfers sometimes arriving in as little as 30 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, this method charges higher commissions compared to bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. The minimum withdrawal amount for bank cards is 10 euros, and the maximum is 5,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:07:00]</a>.

It is considered intelligent to always save on commissions, especially when dealing with significant quantities of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

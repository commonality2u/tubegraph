This article will guide you through the process of [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | creating a survey]] within Google Forms, explaining how to set up questions, configure settings, and prepare your survey for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing Google Forms

To access Google Forms, navigate to Google Chrome and locate the purple "Forms" icon within the Google applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This will take you directly to the forms section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Starting a New Survey

While Google Forms offers various templates, such as those for event attendance, appointments, or contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, it does not typically offer specific templates for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. It's often best to start with a blank form for a custom survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Naming and Describing Your Survey

1.  **Title**: Assign a clear title to your survey, such as "Survey Number One" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. You can customize this to fit your survey's purpose, for example, "Survey on Belfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  **Description**: Add a description to provide context for your survey, like "Survey for the final degree project of the psychology course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This text can be formatted with bold or italics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Previewing Your Survey

To see how your survey will appear to respondents, click on the "Preview" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. You can preview it again after adding questions to check the layout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

## Adding Questions to Your Survey

Google Forms allows you to [[using_different_question_types_in_google_forms | use different question types]] to gather information for your survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

### Recommended Question Types for Surveys

The most commonly used question types for surveys include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:

*   **Multiple Options (Multiple Choice)**: Allows respondents to select one option from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. You can add as many options as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes**: Allows respondents to select multiple options from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Dropdowns**: Presents options in a dropdown menu, where respondents select one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Linear Scales**: Useful for rating questions, such as "How much have you liked Belfast?" with a scale from 1 to 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. You can label the minimum and maximum values, e.g., "very little" for 1 and "much" for 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Multiple Choice Grid / Checkbox Grid**: Allows respondents to select options across multiple rows and columns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Date and Time**: Can be used to record when respondents are filling out the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Less Common Question Types for Surveys

*   **Short Answer / Paragraph**: While available, these are not typically used for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Survey Settings

After creating your questions, you can configure various settings for your survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### General Settings

*   **Collect Email Addresses**: You can choose to collect the email addresses of respondents. This can be useful for verifying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Send copies of replies**: Respondents can receive a copy of their answers, which requires collecting their email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Allow modification of answers**: By default, respondents cannot modify their answers after submission, which is usually preferred for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Limit to one response**: This crucial setting ensures that each person can only fill out the survey once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### Presentation Settings

*   **Convert to questionnaire**: This option is primarily used for tests or quizzes, allowing you to assign scores and define answers. It is generally not used for standard surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Time limitation**: While not a built-in feature, you can add a time limitation to your survey using a free plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Default Settings

You can save your current form settings as defaults for future forms, which can be useful for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

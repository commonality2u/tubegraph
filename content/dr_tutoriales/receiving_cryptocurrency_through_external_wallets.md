To receive cryptocurrency from an external wallet, such as moving funds from Coinbase to Binance, the process involves obtaining the deposit address from the receiving platform and using it on the sending platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This method allows users to consolidate their digital assets for various purposes, including reinvestment or easier management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Key Steps for Receiving Cryptocurrency

The primary step to receive cryptocurrency is to locate the deposit address or QR code on the platform where you want to receive the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Locating the Deposit Address (e.g., on Binance)

1.  **Navigate to Wallet Overview**: Access your wallet on the receiving platform and go to the "Overview" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  **Select Deposit Option**: Look for the "Deposit" option, usually found at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  **Choose "Deposit Cryptocurrencies"**: Click on "Deposit Cryptocurrencies" to initiate the process for crypto rather than fiat currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   Fiat currency refers to local currency like euros, which is different from cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
4.  **Select Cryptocurrency**: Choose the specific cryptocurrency you intend to deposit. For example, if you are sending Bitcoin, select Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   The deposit address (QR code or alphanumeric code) will change depending on the selected cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
5.  **Retrieve Address/QR Code**: The platform will display a unique QR code and an alphanumeric address for your chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This address is crucial for the sending platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Sending from an External Wallet (e.g., from Coinbase)

Once you have the deposit address from the receiving platform, you can initiate the transfer from your external wallet:

1.  **Access "Send and Receive"**: On the external wallet (e.g., Coinbase), select the "Send and Receive" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
2.  **Choose Cryptocurrency to Send**: Select the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
3.  **Specify Amount**: Enter the amount of cryptocurrency you want to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
4.  **Enter Receiving Address**: Paste the alphanumeric deposit address obtained from the receiving platform into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, you can use a mobile device to scan the QR code of the receiving address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
5.  **Add a Note (Optional)**: You can include a note for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
6.  **Confirm Transaction**: Review the details, including any commissions charged by the sending platform (e.g., Coinbase charges a commission fee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
7.  **Enter Verification Code**: A verification code will be sent to your registered mobile phone for security purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Enter this code to confirm the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Transaction Confirmation and Time

After initiating the transfer, the transaction will be processed. It may take approximately 10 minutes for the funds to appear in the receiving wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
You will typically receive a confirmation message on your mobile phone once the deposit is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The transaction history on the receiving platform will also show the incoming deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

It is advisable to keep records of transaction confirmations, especially emails from the sending platform, as collateral in case of any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

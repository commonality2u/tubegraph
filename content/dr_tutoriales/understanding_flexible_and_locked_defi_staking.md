Defi (Decentralized Finance) staking on Binance offers a way to earn profitability from cryptocurrencies. It is presented as a high-risk product within the "Earn" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## What is Defi Staking?
Defi is inspired by blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, which allows multiple entities to have a copy of transactions, meaning it is not controlled by a single central source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While many believe Defi is the future of finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, it is not considered a very safe product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Binance acts solely as a service platform, meaning it does not guarantee that Defi projects will always work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This highlights the inherent high risk, despite the potential for very good profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. It is recommended to start with a small capital to gain experience with Defi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. There are both high-quality and less reliable Defi projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Types of Defi Staking on Binance
When looking at Defi products on Binance, key columns include:
*   Annual Profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>
*   Minimum Amount Blocked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   Subscribe option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>

The "Duration" column is crucial as it indicates how long your capital will be staked. This can be either [[comparing_flexible_and_locked_savings | flexible]] or locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Flexible Staking
[[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible staking]] (referred to as "flexible lock" in the video) allows users to deposit cryptocurrencies and remove them at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Locked Staking
[[locked_savings_on_binance | Locked staking]] (referred to as "defi blocked") requires users to commit their cryptocurrencies for a specific period, such as 7 or 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Typically, longer lock-up periods offer higher profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. However, this is not always the case, as seen with DAI, where both 7-day and 30-day locked options offered the same 8.79% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Profitability and Risk
While the current offerings might show an annual return of 8.79% for DAI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>, Defi can offer significantly higher returns, with annual returns sometimes exceeding 30% or even 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The Annual Percentage Yield (API) in Defi is not a fixed value; it adjusts daily based on chain rewards and can vary, sometimes even becoming negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This variability highlights the [[profitability_and_risks_in_defi | profitability and risks in Defi]].

Binance explicitly states it is not responsible for losses incurred due to project contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. Users are advised to research the projects and cryptocurrencies they invest in, as some projects have failed due to contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

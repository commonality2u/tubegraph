This article explains the [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commission fees]] related to converting cryptocurrencies within a platform, detailing two primary [[methods_to_convert_cryptocurrencies | methods to convert cryptocurrencies]].

## Understanding Cryptocurrency Conversion
Converting cryptocurrencies involves exchanging one digital asset for another to manage a spot portfolio and potentially gain profitability based on market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This tutorial focuses on easy and intuitive ways to exchange crypto coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Users can create an account with a referral link to receive a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, transactions, operations, or capital withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This saved money can be used to purchase other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Methods for Cryptocurrency Conversion

### Method 1: The "Convert" Method
The first method is the "Convert" feature, found under the trading tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This method allows users to select a cryptocurrency they possess (e.g., BNB) and convert it to another available cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

*   **Availability:** This method is only usable if the target cryptocurrency is listed as an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, converting to Polkadot might not be an option via this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Process:** Users select the amount to convert and can preview the conversion before confirming within a five-second window due to price volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

#### Commission Fees for Method 1
For "OTC operations" (which the convert method falls under), the platform states it does not charge any commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, there might be a "spread" in the prices, meaning the buying and selling prices could differ slightly from the absolute market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. There is no direct [[understanding_transaction_fees_in_cryptocurrency_exchanges | commission associated with conversion]] using Method 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Method 2: Market Trading
If a cryptocurrency cannot be converted using Method 1, Method 2, which is slightly more complex, can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This involves using the platform's markets section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Process:** This method often requires two steps if a direct conversion pair isn't available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. For example, to convert from Cardano to CC, one might first convert Cardano to another stablecoin like USDT, and then convert USDT to CC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Market Orders:** Users can execute a market order to buy or sell cryptocurrencies at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. For instance, converting USDT to BNB would involve placing a market buy order for BNB using USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Fees for Method 2:** The transcript does not explicitly detail the [[exchange_commission_structures_and_fees | commission structure]] or [[trading_fees_and_commission_structure_at_kucoin | trading fees]] for Method 2, other than describing it as a "market order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

[[How to create a Google Form | Google Forms]] offers a variety of configuration settings to customize how forms behave, collect information, and interact with respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These settings allow users to tailor the form's functionality beyond just [[Customizing Google Form questions | creating and adding questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Accessing Configuration Settings

Once a [[how_to_create_a_google_form | Google Form]] has been created and [[customizing_google_form_questions | questions added]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, the configuration settings can be found in the "Configuration" or "Settings" section of the form editor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## General Settings (Responses)

These settings control how [[Viewing responses in Google Forms | responses]] are collected and managed:

*   **Collecting Email Addresses**: Users can choose to collect email addresses automatically from respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. If this option is enabled, respondents' emails will be gathered even if a specific email question isn't added to the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Allowing Response Editing**: It's possible to allow respondents to edit their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Limit to One Response**: This setting restricts users to submitting only one response per user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. However, for forms like a "Doubt form" where a user might have multiple questions over time, it may not be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   **File Upload Size Limit**: When questions require file uploads, a total size limit for all uploaded files can be set, for example, up to 1 gigabyte <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Turning the Form into a Questionnaire
Google Forms can be converted into a "Questionnaire" to assign points and define correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This is typically used for quizzes or assessments.

## Presentation Settings

These settings manage the respondent's experience while filling out the form:

*   **Display Progress Bar**: This option shows respondents a progress bar indicating how much of the form they have completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Random Question Order**: Questions can be displayed in a random order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Custom Confirmation Message**: After submission, a custom confirmation message can be displayed instead of the default "Your response is recorded" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. For example, "Reply sent correct. Subscribe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Show Link to Submit Another Response**: Provides an option for respondents to submit another response immediately after completing the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Show Results Summary**: Allows respondents to view a summary of the responses after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

## Default Values

Users can set default values for future forms they create:

*   **Register Email Addresses by Default**: This setting can be enabled so that all newly created forms automatically collect email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Customization and Sharing Considerations

While not strictly configuration settings, the transcript touches upon customization and how settings impact sharing:

*   **Customizing the Theme**: Users can [[customizing_google_form_questions | customize the form's theme]], including the header, fonts, and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Impact on Embedding**: If a form includes a file upload question, it may not generate an HTML code for embedding it directly onto a webpage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. In such cases, the file upload question would need to be removed to generate the embed code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
*   **Sharing Options**: While forms can be shared via email, sending them via a direct link is recommended for anonymity, as sending via email will display the sender's email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

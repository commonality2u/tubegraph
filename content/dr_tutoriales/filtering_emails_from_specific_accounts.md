This tutorial explains [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | how to organize emails automatically in Gmail]] by [[filtering_and_managing_emails_in_gmail | creating filters]] for specific accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method helps to [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | prioritize]] and [[organizing_emails_with_labels | sort emails]] by sending them directly into designated folders, bypassing the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up automatic filtering, ensure you have relevant [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | email folders]] created in your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. For example, if you wish to filter YouTube notifications, a "YouTube" folder should exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a>.

## Steps to Filter Emails Automatically

1.  **Access Gmail**: Open your trusted browser, such as Google Chrome, and navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify Target Emails**: Locate an email from the specific account you wish to filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Filter Creation**:
    *   Click on the three dots (More options) menu associated with the selected email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   Choose "Filter similar messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This action will populate the filter creation window with the sender's email address (e.g., `no-reply@youtube.com`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
4.  **Create Filter**:
    *   In the filter creation window, click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
5.  **Configure Filter Options**:
    *   **Skip the Inbox**: Select the "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" option. This ensures that new emails from this sender do not appear in your primary inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Apply to Folder**: Check "Apply the label:" and select the appropriate folder (e.g., "YouTube") from the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Emails will then appear as unread directly within this folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Apply to Existing Conversations**: Check "Also apply filter to X matching conversations" to move all existing emails from that sender into the designated folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
6.  **Finalize Filter**: Click "Create filter" to save your settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

Once the filter is created, all emails from the specified account will be automatically grouped and placed directly into the chosen folder, bypassing your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This provides a clean and organized inbox, allowing you to [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | prioritize]] and read emails at your convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.

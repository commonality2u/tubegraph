Checking an iPhone's status, particularly whether it has been reported as stolen or lost, can be done using its unique International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process is straightforward and involves using an online tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## What is an IMEI Number?

The IMEI is a unique identification number assigned to every Apple device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. If an iPhone is lost or stolen, its IMEI number can be registered with Apple as a lost, disappeared, or stolen device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Why Check an iPhone's IMEI?

It is highly recommended to [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | check the IMEI number]] when purchasing a second-hand iPhone. This ensures that the device is not reported as stolen or missing, preventing potential issues for the buyer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. If a device has been reported as lost or stolen, the online check will reveal this status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Requirements for Checking

To perform an IMEI check, you will need:
*   Access to a specific web page (the link is provided in the first comment of the video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   The iPhone itself, to retrieve its IMEI number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## [[Locating the IMEI number on your device | How to Find Your iPhone's IMEI Number]]

The IMEI can be found in several locations on your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### On an Activated iPhone

If your iPhone is operational and unlocked, you can find the IMEI through the settings:
1.  Go to "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
3.  Tap on "Information" (or "About") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
4.  Scroll down to locate the IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

For iPhones with [[Understanding dual SIM iPhones and their IMEI numbers | dual SIM]] capability, there will be a separate IMEI number associated with each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. It is crucial to check both IMEI numbers to ensure neither is reported as stolen or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### On a Locked or Newly Reset iPhone

If your device is locked or has just been reset (e.g., in a new purchase state), there are alternative methods to find the IMEI, often presented visually, such as on the activation screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Performing the IMEI Check

Once you have the IMEI number(s), proceed with the following steps:
1.  Go to the specified web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
2.  Paste or type the IMEI number into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  Complete the "I am not a robot" verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  The system will then report the status of the IMEI, indicating if the device is activated, if [[importance_of_find_my_iphone_feature | Find My iPhone]] is enabled, and whether it is reported as stolen or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Converting YouTube videos into text is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This method specifically focuses on using a Google Chrome extension to achieve this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The "Glass" Extension
The core tool for this [[video_conversion_process | video conversion process]] is a Google Chrome extension called "Glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This extension utilizes Chat GPT to facilitate the conversion of content from YouTube to text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. While the extension can be installed on Google Chrome and Safari, and its parent code can be used with Python, the demonstration focuses on its use within Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## [[transcribing_youtube_videos_to_text | Transcribing YouTube Videos to Text]] with Glass
To [[transcribing_youtube_videos_to_text | transcribe a YouTube video to text]] using "Glass," follow these steps:
1.  Install the "Glass" extension on your Chrome browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Open a new tab and navigate to the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  Select and enter any YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  Once the extension is installed, a small window labeled "transcript and summery" (meaning "Transcript and abstract") will appear on the video page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
5.  Click on this window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. You will then see the video's transcript, broken down into paragraphs for every minute or sequence of seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The entire video's content is displayed this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Copying the Transcript
Once the transcript is visible, it can be easily copied:
*   To copy the transcript to a document like Word, simply select the desired text and use the copy function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Alternatively, there is a direct "copy as text" option available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   The copied text can then be pasted wherever needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

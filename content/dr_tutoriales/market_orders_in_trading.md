Orders within the [[kucoin_order_types | KuCoin]] platform facilitate various buy-sell transactions, making strategic purchases and sales within the market easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. These orders enable users to define specific conditions for their trades.

## Accessing Order Features
To access the order features on [[kucoin_order_types | KuCoin]], navigate to the "Trade" section and select "Spot" market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:44">[01:34:44]</a>. The platform displays an interactive graph, an order book, and sections for recent and open orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. Orders can be placed from the lower part of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>.

## Types of Orders

### [[understanding_market_orders_on_binance | Market Order]]
A [[cryptocurrency_market_orders_vs_limit_orders | market order]] is executed in real-time, allowing you to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at its current market value the moment you click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. For example, if KCS is priced at 10.687 USDT, a market order will buy or sell it at that exact value at the moment of execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. The price may fluctuate slightly between clicking and execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### [[limit_orders_explained | Limit Order]]
A [[cryptocurrency_market_orders_vs_limit_orders | limit order]] allows you to set a specific price and quantity for a buy or sell order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. The order is executed only when the real market price reaches your predetermined value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

*   **Setting a Buy Limit Order**: If you anticipate a price drop, you can set a buy [[limit_orders_explained | limit order]] at a lower target price. When the asset's price falls to that level, your order will be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. For instance, setting a buy order for KCS at 9.984 USDT means the purchase will occur when KCS reaches that price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Setting a Sell Limit Order**: If you expect the price to rise, you can place a sell [[limit_orders_explained | limit order]] at a higher target price. When the asset reaches this resistance value, your order will be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. For example, a sell order at 11.187 USDT will sell your KCS once it hits that price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

Open [[limit_orders_explained | limit orders]] are visible in the "Open Orders" section of the order book, displaying details like the pair, price, and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Orders can be canceled if they haven't been fully executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>.

### [[stop_limit_orders | Stop-Limit Order]]
A [[stop_limit_orders | stop-limit order]] involves two prices: a limit price and a stop price, along with a quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

*   **Limit Price**: The price at which the order begins to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
*   **Stop Price**: The value at which the order will be fully executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:54">[08:48:54]</a>.

When the limit price is reached, the order starts to execute gradually, with a percentage of the order filling as the price moves towards the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Once the stop price is reached, 100% of the order is executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. If the price moves in an unfavorable direction before reaching the stop price, only a partial percentage of the order may be executed, reducing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. This order type is useful for [[trading_features_and_strategies_on_exchange_platforms | reducing risk]] in certain operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.

### [[stop_market_orders | Stop-Market Order]]
A [[stop_market_orders | stop-market order]] shares a similar concept to a [[stop_limit_orders | stop-limit order]], but instead of setting a limit price, the buy or sell action is performed at the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

*   **Stop Price**: The price at which the market order will be triggered and begin to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>.
*   **Execution**: The order begins to execute at the current market price when the stop price is reached, and 100% of the order will be filled when it hits the defined stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

Like other order types, stop-market orders can be canceled even if only partially filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.

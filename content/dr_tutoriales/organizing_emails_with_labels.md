Gmail offers the functionality to [[creating_labels_in_gmail | create labels]] to effectively [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | organize your inbox]] and manage emails [00:00:08]. This process allows you to group related emails, making it easier to navigate and keep your inbox tidy [00:00:13].

## Accessing Label Settings

To begin organizing your emails with labels, you first need to access the Gmail settings:
1.  Enter your Gmail account [00:00:17].
2.  Navigate to the "Configuration" (Settings) option, typically found on the right side of the interface [00:00:38].
3.  From the configuration options, select the "Labels" window [00:00:46].

## Understanding Default Labels

Upon creating a Gmail account, you will find default categories such as news, subscriptions, and comments [00:00:24]. The "Labels" window allows you to see what is currently visible on the left-hand tray of your Gmail interface, including hidden items like posts, important chats, and sent emails [00:00:53]. Anything you add as a label will appear on this left-hand menu [00:01:08].

## Creating New Labels

The primary purpose of the "Labels" window is to [[creating_labels_in_gmail | create new labels]] (or tags) [00:01:12].

### Setting Up a Main Label
1.  Click on the option to [[setting_up_new_labels_and_subtags | create new labels]] [00:01:15].
2.  Give your main label a name, for example, "YouTube" to categorize all YouTube-related emails [00:01:18].

### Creating Nested Labels (Sub-tags)
You can create sub-tags, which function like folders, within your main labels to further refine your organization [00:01:31].
1.  After creating a main label, like "YouTube," you can create sub-tags such as "Comments" or "Subscriptions" [00:01:34].
2.  When creating a sub-tag, specify that it should be nested under your main label (e.g., select "YouTube" for "Comments") [00:01:42].
3.  Nested labels will appear slightly indented under their parent label on the left-hand menu, indicating their hierarchical relationship [00:01:54].

### Managing Existing Labels
You have the flexibility to manage your labels as needed:
*   **Delete**: If you wish to remove a label, select it and choose the delete option [00:02:15].
*   **Modify**: To change a label's name or other properties, select "modify" [00:02:21].

## Applying Labels to Emails

Once labels are created, you can assign them to your emails:
1.  Search for emails related to a specific topic, such as "subscriptions" [00:02:32].
2.  Select all the relevant emails [00:02:56].
3.  Right-click on the selected emails and choose "tag how" or "label how" [00:03:00].
4.  Assign the appropriate label, for instance, "YouTube subscriptions" [00:03:05]. All selected emails will now be categorized under this label [00:03:08].

## [[using_color_coding_for_email_labels | Color-coding Labels]]

To make your labels even more distinguishable, you can assign them colors:
1.  Go back to the "Labels" section in your Gmail settings.
2.  Select a label (e.g., "YouTube") and choose a color, like red, to visually represent it [00:03:22].
3.  You can also apply the same color to all its sub-tags (e.g., "Comments" and "Subscriptions") for consistency [00:03:34].
4.  Emails tagged with these labels will now appear in the assigned color in your inbox, making them easily identifiable [00:03:37].

This method provides a basic yet highly effective way to [[filtering_and_managing_emails_in_gmail | filter and manage your emails]], ensuring they are well-organized according to your custom categories [00:04:14].

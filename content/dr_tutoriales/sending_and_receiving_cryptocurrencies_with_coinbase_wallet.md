[[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] serves as a secure application for saving cryptocurrencies and tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. It allows users to store a wide range of cryptocurrencies and some NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

The wallet is available on:
*   Google Play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>
*   Apple App Store (for iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>
*   As a Google Chrome extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>

The mobile application for both Android and iOS is very similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## How to Set Up and Access Your Wallet
For detailed instructions on how to download and set up [[how_to_download_and_set_up_coinbase_wallet | Coinbase Wallet]], a tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.

When setting up, users can choose privacy settings, either public (allowing others to search your username and send crypto) or private (preventing other wallets from searching you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. It's generally recommended to choose public in case someone wants to send you cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

For security, the wallet can be protected using Face ID on iPhones or a password on other mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Security and Backup
[[how_to_secure_and_back_up_your_coinbase_wallet | Backing up your Coinbase Wallet]] is crucial. If the recovery phrase is lost, access to the account will be impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. The recovery phrase typically consists of 12 words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. Backup options include:
*   iCloud backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>
*   Manual backup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> (e.g., taking a screenshot and copying to a secure location) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>

## Managing Cryptocurrencies and NFTs
The wallet's interface displays coins and NFTs associated with your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. It also features a bottom menu with sections for Wallet, Internet (browser), and Settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. In settings, you can configure the active blockchain (e.g., Ethereum, Binance Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.

## Receiving Cryptocurrencies
To receive cryptocurrency:
1.  Navigate to the "Receive" option in the Wallet section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
2.  Choose the specific cryptocurrency you wish to receive, such as Litecoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
3.  The wallet will provide your receiving address and a QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
4.  You can select the blockchain standard (e.g., SegWit, Legacy) which will generate different QR codes and addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.
5.  Payments can also be accepted via your username, which can be shared with other [[receiving_cryptocurrency_through_external_wallets | Coinbase Wallet]] users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Sharing your username via WhatsApp or other contacts is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Sending Cryptocurrencies
To send cryptocurrency:
1.  Select the "Send" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.
2.  You can send from your main Coinbase account or another wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
3.  To send from your main Coinbase account, you will need to connect your [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] with your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This involves authorizing the connection automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>. Once connected, you can send cryptocurrencies held on the Coinbase platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>.
4.  Sending requires you to have cryptocurrency in your wallet; if not, you'll need to transfer them from the Coinbase platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.
5.  You can send by scanning a QR code or by manually entering the recipient's wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.
6.  Always be aware of commissions associated with the blockchain network being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. It's often recommended to use networks with cheaper fees, such as Litecoin, and then convert them later within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.

## Buying and Swapping Cryptocurrencies
*   You can buy cryptocurrencies directly from the wallet by connecting to the Coinbase platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. This allows you to use various payment methods like credit/debit cards or available cash in your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. When the [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] is connected to the Coinbase platform, both crypto and fiat funds are linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   The "Trade" or "Convert" section allows you to exchange cryptocurrencies to USD or swap between different cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. All transactions are subject to Coinbase's commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>.

## Wallet Browser Functionality
The middle button in the bottom menu provides access to the internet, allowing you to access online platforms like PancakeSwap directly through the wallet's search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. This allows you to connect your [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] to various DeFi platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.

## Key Takeaway
It's important to understand that [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] is an independent wallet, separate from the main Coinbase exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Transfers between [[coinbase_wallet_overview_and_features | Coinbase Wallet]] and the Coinbase platform, or other platforms, will incur commissions associated with the blockchain network in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

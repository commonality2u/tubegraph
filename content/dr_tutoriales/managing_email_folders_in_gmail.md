Gmail utilizes "labels" to help users [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | organize their inbox]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These labels function similarly to folders, allowing for systematic email management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Accessing Label Settings

Once inside, navigate to the "configuration" or settings menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Within the settings, locate and select the "Labels" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This section displays all existing labels and allows for their management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Any labels configured here will appear in the left-hand navigation pane of your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

2.  Select an existing parent label from the dropdown menu (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
3.  Any label created this way will appear indented slightly to the right under its parent label in the left-hand navigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Examples of sublabels could be "comments" and "subscriptions" under the "YouTube" label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

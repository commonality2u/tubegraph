New [[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | YouTube channels]] face certain limitations, including restrictions on video length. Understanding and enabling these permissions is crucial for uploading longer content.

## YouTube's Video Length Restriction

By default, [[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | YouTube channels]] are not permitted to upload videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. If an attempt is made to upload a video exceeding this limit without the necessary permission enabled, YouTube will block the video, often getting stuck at 99% processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is not an error but a specific permission that must be activated for new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Enabling Longer Video Uploads

To enable the permission for [[uploading videos longer than 15 minutes | uploading videos longer than fifteen minutes]], follow these steps:

1.  **Access YouTube Studio**: Go to the [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] of the channel you wish to update <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Switch to Classic Version**: In [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], switch to the classic version. This is recommended for faster access to the necessary settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
3.  **Navigate to Channel Settings**: Once in the classic version, click on the "Channel" option located in the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  **Locate "Longer Videos" Option**: Within the channel settings, you will see various options and permissions related to your channel, such as upload, monetization, and live broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The option relevant to this feature is typically labeled something akin to "longer duration videos" or "upload videos longer than 15 minutes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. A channel that has not yet enabled this feature will show that it is not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
5.  **Verify Your Account**: To enable this feature, you will need to verify your [[youtube_account_verification | YouTube account]]. This can be done via computer, Android, or iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. YouTube will send a confirmation code to your mobile phone or the email address associated with your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
6.  **Enter Confirmation Code**: Enter the received confirmation code to verify that you are the owner of the [[youtube_account_verification | YouTube account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Once this verification process is complete and the permission is enabled, you will be able to upload videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

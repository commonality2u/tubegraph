When using a cryptocurrency wallet like Trust Wallet, it's crucial to understand the importance of backing up and securing your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The application operates identically on both Android and iOS devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Wallet Creation and Secret Phrase

Upon creating a new wallet, you must first accept the privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. You will then be prompted to enter an access code, which must be re-entered for confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

The next critical step is to make a security copy of your wallet, which involves recording a 12-word secret phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

> **Important Conditions for the Secret Phrase:**
> *   Losing this phrase means you will never again access your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
> *   Exposing or sharing the phrase can lead to your funds being stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
> *   Trust Wallet is not responsible for funds lost due to these reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

The secret phrase will be displayed (though censored for privacy in tutorials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It is strongly recommended to copy this phrase somewhere secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Physical paper is advised over a PC, as a PC is vulnerable to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

After copying, you will need to re-enter the words in the correct order as a verification process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Once this is successfully completed, your wallet is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For more details on this process, see [[creating_and_importing_wallets_on_trust_wallet | Creating and Importing Wallets on Trust Wallet]].

## Security and Preferences

Within the wallet's settings, you can configure security options and change your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Key preferences that can be adjusted include:
*   Standard language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
*   Standard currency (e.g., USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   Browser access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   Clearing the cache <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

The application can also be configured to match your mobile device's theme, such as dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For more on these options, refer to [[trust_wallet_settings_and_security_preferences | Trust Wallet settings and security preferences]].

You can also [[managing_cryptocurrency_wallets | manage multiple wallets]] from the same mobile device by adding new ones in the wallet section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

[[Introduction to Liquid Swap on Binance | Liquid Swap]], also referred to as "Liquid Pool" or similar terms, is a financial product that allows users to invest cryptocurrencies and financial assets to potentially earn profits on a platform [00:00:05]. The process involves providing liquidity to the market [00:01:24].

## What is Liquid Swap?

Providing liquidity means supplying coins or assets (which can be cryptocurrencies, Euros, or Dollars) that people can use for buying, converting, exchanging, or selling [00:01:41]. Users earn profitability through commissions generated from transactions carried out with the coins they have provided [00:01:52].

## Profitability and Its Variability

The returns offered by [[understanding_the_risks_and_profitability_of_liquid_swap | Liquid Swap]] are expressed weekly, defined as the "AP" over seven days [00:02:22]. This profitability is not fixed and fluctuates based on the volume of transactions involving the contributed cryptocurrencies [00:02:34].

It is recommended to use [[how_to_provide_liquidity_with_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrencies]] that have a high trading volume when using this product. This approach can help reduce risk and ensure fewer losses [00:02:41].

## Types of Liquidity Options

There are two main categories of liquidity within Liquid Swap:

*   **Stable Liquidity** Products in this category typically have profitability that does not vary significantly [00:02:56].
*   **Innovation Liquidity** These products tend to have more variable profitability [00:03:00].

## Adding and Withdrawing Liquidity

Users can choose to add or withdraw liquidity they have contributed [00:03:06]. When adding liquidity, it's possible to add two currencies simultaneously (e.g., Bitcoin and another asset like BUSD) without incurring a commission for adding liquidity [00:03:31]. However, adding a single currency (e.g., only Bitcoin or only BUSD) will result in a commission charge, making it less profitable [00:03:37].

The total size of the liquidity pool can be observed, showing the combined amount of assets currently in the pool [00:03:46].

## Understanding Risks and Profitability

It is crucial to understand that profitability is not always guaranteed with Liquid Swap [00:04:16]. Users might even experience negative values [00:04:33]. This occurs if the price of the cryptocurrencies contributed drops significantly after the transaction, and this depreciation outweighs the commissions earned from transactions [00:04:42]. If the value of the coins decreases faster than the commissions earned, profitability will be negative [00:05:09].

## Managing Participation

Users can view their current participation and historical transactions in Liquid Swap [00:05:44]. This section displays the contributed amount, total yield, and daily profitability [00:05:48]. The history also shows when liquidity was added, withdrawn, or added again [00:06:21].

While withdrawing money may incur percentage commissions [00:06:52], the general strategy for [[understanding_the_risks_and_profitability_of_liquid_swap | Liquid Swap]] is to leave funds deposited for a relatively medium to long-term duration [00:07:01]. This allows people to use the money for transactions, enabling the user to obtain profitability over time [00:07:08].

This guide will show you how to manage and deactivate location services on your iPhone, including global settings and individual app permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Accessing Location Settings

To begin, navigate to your iPhone's **Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. If you can't find it, look for the "Adjustments" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

Once in [[privacy_and_security_settings_on_ios | Settings]], scroll down and select "Privacy & Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, which is represented by a blue hand symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Within Privacy & Security, you'll find a section dedicated to "Localization" (Location Services) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Deactivating Location Services Globally

Inside the Location Services section, you can see if it's currently turned on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. To deactivate location services for all applications and features on your iPhone, simply turn off the main toggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This action will deactivate location services for everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Managing Location for Individual Applications

You also have the ability to manage location permissions for specific applications individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This allows you to [[managing_location_settings_for_individual_apps_on_iphone | customize location usage settings]] based on your needs for each app, such as Uber or Bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

For each application, you can select from the following options regarding location access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>:
*   **When in Use:** Location is used only when the app is actively being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Ask Next Time:** The app will prompt you for permission each time it attempts to use your location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   **Never:** The app will never be allowed to access your location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Always:** The app can always access your location, even when not in active use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Some applications may have location disabled by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Other Location-Related Settings

### Location Sharing and Find My iPhone
Within the Location Services section, you can also manage location sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. The "[[how_to_check_if_an_iphone_is_stolen_or_lost | Find My iPhone]]" option can be activated, which allows you to locate your device if it is lost or stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### Photo Geolocation
The Privacy & Security settings are also where you manage features like [[enabling_and_disabling_photo_geolocation | photo geolocation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. There is a tutorial available that teaches you how to determine the location of a photo easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

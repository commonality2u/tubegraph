This article explains how to utilize the savings features on a cryptocurrency exchange to generate returns from owned cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Understanding the profitability offered by these savings options can help in making decisions about which cryptocurrencies to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Accessing Savings on the Exchange

To access savings options, navigate to the "Finance" section of the exchange and then select "Savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This section compiles various programs designed to help users earn profitability on their cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Here, you will find options like flexible terms, fixed terms, and high-risk products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## Flexible vs. Locked Savings: Key Differences

The two primary types of savings discussed are [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] and [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. When depositing a cryptocurrency, you receive an annual profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### [[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible Savings]]

[[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible savings]] allow you to deposit and withdraw your cryptocurrency at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The [[interest_rates_and_profitability_for_savings_products | interest rate]] received is generally more or less fixed, though it can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. While the returns are lower compared to locked options, the ability to withdraw funds whenever needed offers significant flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### [[locked_savings_on_binance | Locked Savings]]

With [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]], you deposit a cryptocurrency for a specific number of days, such as 7, 14, 30, or 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The [[interest_rates_and_profitability_for_savings_products | interest rate]] or profitability varies depending on the chosen duration, with longer durations typically yielding higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This is because providing more time to the exchange for using your asset allows them to generate more profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. However, once deposited, the funds cannot be withdrawn until the locked period ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Strategic Considerations

[!TIP]
It is recommended to use [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]] when you do not immediately need the funds or are very confident in a long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, if there was an option to lock Bitcoin for the long term and you have no intention of selling it, this could be a viable consideration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

[!WARNING]
Always consider the market period you are in before depositing cryptocurrencies into [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. If a cryptocurrency is entering a correction stage, locking it for a period like 30 or 90 days might prevent you from accessing your capital if the currency depreciates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. While savings products are not considered high-risk, there is exposure if the currency's value declines, as you cannot withdraw your capital from [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

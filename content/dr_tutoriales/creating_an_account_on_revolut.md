To begin using Revolut, users must first download the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The speaker offers a referral link in the video's first comment to create a Revolut account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. If users like the platform and its plans, they can earn ten euros by using this referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. To win these ten euros, users must order a card and make a purchase with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This process is described as very easy and simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Once an account is set up and the app is accessed, the main menu appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. From here, users can view their account details by clicking on their picture in the top left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This section allows users to:
*   Improve their plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   Invite friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   Access personal data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   See the current pricing plan (e.g., standard account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>
*   Review boundaries and documents attached to the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>

The account details section also provides options to:
*   Change the theme and application icon (which can be customized based on the user's [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | plan]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Manage access key, privacy settings, and block betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   Enable login with Face ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
*   Access information about Revolut on platforms like the App Store, Facebook, and Twitter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Close the account or log out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>

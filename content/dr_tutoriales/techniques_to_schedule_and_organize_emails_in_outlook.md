If you have sent an email within Outlook and wish to [[how_to_cancel_or_delete_an_email_in_outlook | cancel or delete]] it, this guide explains the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Key Condition for Recall
For the recall process to be successful, it is crucial that the recipient **has not yet opened the message** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the email has been opened, the recall will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Steps to Recall or Delete a Sent Email

1.  **Navigate to Sent Messages**: Go to your "Sent Messages" folder in Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
2.  **Select the Email**: Locate and click on the specific email you wish to recall or modify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Access Recall/Edit Options**: Once the email is open, you can either:
    *   Click the "Edit Message" or "Remove" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
    *   Click directly on the dedicated button with the recall symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Recall Options

From the recall menu, you will typically have two main options:

*   **Delete the Message Completely**: This option aims to entirely delete the message from the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   **Delete and Send a Modified Version**: This allows you to delete the original email and replace it with a modified version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. For instance, if you forgot to add a closing remark, you can modify the message and resend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Notification of Recall Success

Outlook provides an option to notify you whether the recall or modification has been successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. After initiating the recall, you will receive a confirmation stating that you "tried to make the recall" of the message at a specific date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If the recall is successful, you will receive a confirmation of its total elimination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

[[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]], also known as Liquid Pull, is a financial product offered on Binance that allows users to invest their cryptocurrencies and financial assets to achieve profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The product is found within the "finance" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## How Liquid Swap Works
When using [[how_to_use_liquid_swap_to_invest_in_cryptocurrencies | Liquid Swap]], users act as liquidity providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This means they contribute their cryptocurrencies or other assets like euros or dollars, to a pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These provided coins enable other users to perform transactions such as buying, converting, exchanging, or selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. As a liquidity provider, you earn profitability based on the commissions generated from these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Profitability

Profitability in [[profitability_and_risks_in_defi | Liquid Swap]] is expressed as an APY (Annual Percentage Yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This APY indicates the profitability earned over seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

> [!INFO] Key Factors Affecting Profitability
> *   **Fluctuating Rates**: The profitability values are not fixed; they change significantly and depend entirely on the volume of transactions occurring with the specific cryptocurrencies in the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
> *   **High-Volume Cryptocurrencies**: To maximize returns and minimize risk, it is recommended to use cryptocurrencies that have a high trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
> *   **Adding Both Currencies**: When adding liquidity, contributing both paired currencies (e.g., Bitcoin and BUSD) will not incur a commission. However, adding only one currency (e.g., Bitcoin or BUSD separately) will result in a commission charge, making it less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
> *   **Holding Period**: For optimal profitability, it is advisable to leave your funds deposited for a relatively medium to long period, allowing more transactions to occur and generate commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

For example, some coins might offer an APY of 7.80% or 4.44% weekly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Types of Liquidity

There are two main categories of liquidity offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>:

*   **Stable Liquidity**: Products in this category typically have profitability that does not vary significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Liquidity of Innovation**: Products here tend to show greater variation in profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Risks

> [!WARNING] Impermanent Loss
> A crucial concept to understand when using [[profitability_and_risks_in_defi | Liquid Swap]] is that profitability is not always guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. There are instances where you may experience negative values, leading to a loss of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This occurs if the price of the cryptocurrencies you've deposited decreases faster than the commissions you earn from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. The depreciation of your contributed currencies can outweigh the income from commissions, resulting in a negative overall return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

Additionally, when you withdraw your funds, commissions are charged as a percentage of your withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Managing Your Participation

Users can add or remove liquidity at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. You can view your current participation in the pool, including the amount contributed and the total yield generated (e.g., 8.7706% total yield, 1.04% daily yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. A transaction history is also available to track when liquidity was added or withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Before using the product, it is highly recommended to read the terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Uploading video fragments from series, chapters, films, or [[uploading_anime_clips_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | anime]] to YouTube without being banned requires specific editing [[video_editing_techniques_to_avoid_copyright_bans_on_youtube | techniques]] to bypass copyright detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. YouTube can ban videos due to copyrighted audio (music, voices) or images displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can lead to a video being blocked from [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | public visibility]] or even banned, although some videos might be monetized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Editing Program Used
The video demonstrates [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_copyright_detection | strategies]] using Filmora 9, a video editing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Key Editing Strategies
The following [[video_editing_techniques_to_avoid_copyright_bans_on_youtube | techniques]] are personal [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_copyright_detection | strategies]] that have proven effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:

### Visual Modifications
*   **Adding a Channel Logo**: Incorporate your channel's logo or a distinct image throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This logo should be visible from start to finish, as it modifies the video's original image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **Applying Visual Effects**: Utilize effects available within the editing software. An example given is a "leak of light" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Adding a Border**: Apply a distinctive border around the video content. This border can be customized in color (e.g., blue below, white above for a blurred effect) and size to consumer taste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The technique of having a full-screen video with a border and logo helps prevent YouTube from tracking the copyright through the images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Audio Modifications
*   **Adjusting Original Audio Volume**: When importing a video into Filmora 9, it comes with a default sound volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. To avoid copyright detection related to audio peaks, slightly reduce the original video's volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Viewers can later increase the volume on YouTube if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Modifying both the image and audio of the video helps bypass copyright tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Uploading and Verification
After applying these [[video_editing_techniques_to_avoid_copyright_bans_on_youtube | editing techniques]], the modified video can be uploaded to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The processing phase on YouTube will confirm that the video has no restrictions and is available for [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | public visibility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

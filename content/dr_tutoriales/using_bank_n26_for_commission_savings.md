Bank N26 is a digital bank highly recommended for minimizing commissions when interacting with platforms like Binance, particularly for users in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>. It is especially useful after Brexit, as Binance's operations are now based in the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>.

## Benefits of Bank N26

N26 is a digital bank designed to allow users to perform transactions with zero commissions when dealing with countries outside the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:23">[03:06:23]</a>. This includes transactions to the United Kingdom and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:02">[03:15:02]</a>. Using N26 can help save on all commissions associated with bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:28">[03:21:28]</a>.

## Saving on Deposits with Bank N26

For depositing national currencies (Fiat) such as Euros or Dollars, bank transfer is the recommended method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:11">[01:45:11]</a>, as it incurs lower commissions compared to other methods like card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:19">[02:00:19]</a>.

Due to Brexit, transfers from Binance (based in the UK) to European banks may incur bank commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. To avoid these charges, using an N26 account for deposits is highly advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>. This digital bank facilitates Fiat deposits with zero commissions via bank transfer, although funds may take one to two business days to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:28">[03:21:28]</a>.

## Saving on Withdrawals with Bank N26

When withdrawing Fiat money from Binance to a bank account, a commission of 0.8% on euros may be charged for bank transfers, and similar charges apply for Visa card withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:06">[10:47:06]</a>.
To avoid these commissions, particularly for transfers from Binance (an "English country" from a European perspective) to a local Spanish bank, using Bank N26 is strongly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:06">[10:56:06]</a>. Using N26 with a bank transfer will help save all associated commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:34">[11:28:34]</a>. Fiat withdrawals via bank transfer generally take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:43">[11:33:43]</a>.

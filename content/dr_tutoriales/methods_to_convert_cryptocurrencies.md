This article outlines two primary methods for exchanging cryptocurrencies (crypto-to-crypto) on the Binance platform, enabling users to manage their spot portfolio and leverage market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These methods aim to be easy, simple, and intuitive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

It is noted that a referral link is available in the first video comment, offering a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, transactions, operations, and capital withdrawals, which can be used to acquire other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Method 1: The "Convert" Feature

The first method utilizes the "Convert" feature, which is considered the easy method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.

### Steps to Use the Convert Method
1.  Navigate to the "Trading" tab at the top of the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
2.  Select the "Convert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to convert *from* (e.g., CYT) and the cryptocurrency you wish to convert *to* (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
4.  Enter the desired amount or select "maximum" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
5.  Click "Preview Conversion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.
6.  Confirm the conversion within five seconds, as cryptocurrency prices (e.g., BNB) have high volatility and change constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>.

### Limitations
This method can only be used if your target cryptocurrency is available for conversion in the selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. For example, converting from BNB to Polkadot may not be directly available via this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. If the desired conversion pair is not listed, this method cannot be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. A minimum quantity is also required for conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Commissions
Binance states that no commission is charged for OTC (Over-The-Counter) operations when [[using_binances_convert_method | converting crypto with this method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>. However, a "spread" will be applied, meaning prices may vary from market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

## Method 2: The "Markets" Feature

This method is slightly more complex but provides more flexibility when Method 1 is not suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Steps to Use the Markets Method
1.  Go to the "Markets" section on the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Zones" and select "Crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you currently hold (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.
4.  If a direct conversion is not available (e.g., converting Cardano (ADA) directly to Polkadot (DOT)), you may need to perform a two-step conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. For example:
    *   First, convert your ADA to a common stablecoin or major cryptocurrency like USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
    *   Then, use that USDT to buy your desired cryptocurrency, such as DOT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
5.  To execute the trade, select a "Market Order" to buy or sell at the current real-time market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. For instance, to convert CYT to BNB, select the CYT/BNB pair, specify the amount of CYT you want to sell, and execute the market order to buy BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.
6.  Once the first conversion is complete, you can then proceed to the relevant market (e.g., BNB/DOT) to complete the second step of your conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

This method allows for more complex [[selling_bitcoin_and_converting_to_other_cryptocurrencies | conversions between various cryptocurrencies]] by leveraging different trading pairs available in the market section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

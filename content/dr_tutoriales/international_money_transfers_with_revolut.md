Revolut is a platform well-known for its capabilities in facilitating international money transfers, often with low commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The platform aims to allow users to send money globally instantly without hidden fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Key Features for International Transfers

### Commission Structure
While Revolut states there are "no hidden commissions," this does not mean there are no commissions at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The first 1,000 euros (or pounds) transferred in a different currency to another bank account in another country typically incur no commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, particularly for Standard accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

However, if the amount exceeds 1,000 euros, Standard accounts will be charged a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. For transfers over this limit, [[Revolut card features | Premium]] and [[Revolut card features | Metal]] accounts are not charged a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Generally, while some charges may apply for transfers to other countries, they are often comparable to or better than traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### Exchange Rates
Revolut allows users to "pay like a local," providing real exchange rates for international transactions in over 150 currencies without additional or hidden charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

## Impact of Revolut Plans on Transfers

The type of Revolut plan significantly affects the benefits related to international transfers. Users can generally choose between a Standard, Plus, Premium, or Metal plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

*   **[[Revolut card features | Standard Plan]]**: This free plan offers one free international transfer per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Subsequent transfers typically incur a fee of 0.50 pounds each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. It's particularly useful for payments under 1,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **[[Revolut card features | Plus Plan]]**: Includes one free international transfer per month, with subsequent transfers costing 0.50 pounds each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **[[Revolut card features | Premium Plan]]**: Offers advantages such as double withdrawal limits at ATMs and may include benefits for larger international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **[[Revolut card features | Metal Plan]]**: Provides unlimited international transfers without commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This plan is particularly beneficial for those making larger or more frequent international payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. It also includes various travel protection and insurance coverage, making it highly useful for frequent travelers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

For individuals making larger payments or transfers in different currencies, upgrading to a [[Revolut card features | Premium]] or [[Revolut card features | Metal]] account is recommended as it offers significant benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This flexibility in managing international payments is considered one of Revolut's greatest advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

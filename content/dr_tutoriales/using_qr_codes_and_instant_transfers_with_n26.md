[[introduction_to_n26_bank_and_its_features | N26]] is a bank that can be managed easily and efficiently from a mobile device using its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The [[navigating_the_n26_app_for_basic_operations | N26 app]] is available and functions identically on both iPhone and Android operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

N26 is known for not charging commissions on domestic or [[the_benefits_of_n26_for_international_transactions | international money transfers]], which can be problematic with many traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. For example, it is useful for transfers to places like Great Britain or the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Instant Transactions with N26

N26 provides features that allow for quick and easy money transfers, including instant transfers and QR code functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Enabling Visibility for Instant Transfers
To receive immediate transactions via QR code, phone number, or email, your visibility within the N26 app must be activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Activating this allows other N26 users to send you money instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This system is comparable to common mobile-to-mobile transfer concepts in Spain, where money is associated with a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

### Receiving Money
Within the N26 app, under the "Receive Money" option, various methods are available, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>:
*   Bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>
*   Debit or credit card to PLP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>
*   Request money with a QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>

### Sending Money
The "Send Money" option in the N26 app provides several ways to transfer funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>:
*   **MoneyBeam:** This allows for instant money transfers to other N26 account holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
*   Bank transfer: Standard bank transfers are completely free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   Foreign currency transfer: These transfers are also completely free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   Scan QR code: You can send money by scanning a recipient's QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.

The ability to use QR codes for both sending and receiving money, combined with instant transfers for N26 users, makes transactions very convenient and efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

[[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | Google Forms]] allows users to create professional surveys and forms step-by-step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Accessing Google Forms

To begin, you should be in the [[accessing_google_forms_through_google_chrome | Google Chrome]] search engine and signed into your Google account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the Google applications icon, usually located on the top right of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
2.  Scroll down to find and select the purple Forms logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Starting a New Form

Upon accessing Google Forms, you'll see various templates such as contact data, attendance confirmation, party invitation, and order request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. To create a new form from scratch, select the "Blank" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Form Title and Description

Give your form a title, such as "Doubts form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, and add a brief description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For example, "This form is used to transmit your doubts to me and see if we can solve them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Adding Questions

You can add various types of questions to your form:

*   **Short Answer**: Suitable for names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a> or Gmail addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Paragraph**: For longer responses, useful for questions like "Explain your doubts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Google Forms may automatically detect the need for a long response based on keywords like "explain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Multiple Choice**: Allows users to select one option from a list, e.g., "Have you subscribed to the channel?" or "Have you liked the video?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes**: Allows users to select multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Dropdown**: Similar to multiple choice but presents options in a dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **File Upload**: Allows respondents to upload files, such as screenshots, to Google Drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. You can specify whether to allow only certain file types, set a maximum number of files (e.g., one), and a maximum file size (e.g., 100 MB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Linear Scale**: For rating satisfaction, typically from 1 to 5, with custom labels for the minimum and maximum values (e.g., "very dissatisfied" to "very satisfied") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Date and Time**: Useful for scheduling meetings or collecting specific dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

### Mandatory Questions

For any question, you can toggle it to be "mandatory," meaning respondents must answer it to submit the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. An asterisk will indicate mandatory questions on the live form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. If a file upload question is mandatory, the form cannot be sent if the user has no files to upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Customizing the Form Appearance

You can [[customizing_google_form_questions | customize]] the form's theme, including changing the header, font, and colors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Adding emojis can also make the form more appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

## Form Settings and Configuration

The "Configuration" section allows you to adjust various settings:

*   **Quiz Mode**: You can turn the form into a questionnaire to assign scores and define correct answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Responses**:
    *   **Collect email addresses**: You can choose to automatically collect email addresses of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. If you don't ask for email as a question, this setting can capture it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   **Allow response editing**: Enables respondents to edit their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   **Limit to one response per user**: Restricts each user to submitting the form only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
    *   **Total file size limit**: Sets a maximum total size for all uploaded files (e.g., 1 GB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Presentation**:
    *   **Display progress bar**: Shows respondents a bar indicating their progress through the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   **Random question order**: Shuffles the order of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Confirmation message**: Customize the message displayed after a user submits the form, e.g., "Reply sent Correct. Subscribe." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   **Show link to send another response**: Allows users to submit the form again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   **View results summary**: Allows respondents to see a summary of responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Default values**: Adjust default settings for future forms, such as automatically registering email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

## Sharing and Sending the Form

Once your form is complete, click "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

*   **Email**: You can invite people by email, though your email address will appear as the sender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Link**: Generate a shareable link. You can choose to shorten the URL for convenience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. Copy this link and share it for people to access the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This is recommended if you want the survey to be anonymous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Embed HTML**: You can generate HTML code to embed the form directly into a web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. Note that if the form includes a file upload option, the HTML code cannot be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. You would need to remove the file upload question to embed the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

After submissions, [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | you can view responses]] in the "Answers" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

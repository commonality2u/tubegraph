This article outlines how to begin using the Payoneer platform, focusing on initial account setup benefits and an overview of its features, based on a tutorial that assumes an account has already been created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Referral Link Benefits

If you are looking to [[types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_differences | create a Payoneer account]], using a referral link can provide a bonus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. By using the referral link provided in the video's first comment, you can earn up to $25 when your first deposit into the platform reaches $1,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. For example, if you open an account and deposit $1,000, you will receive $25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Accessing the Payoneer Platform

The Payoneer platform can be accessed via computer or through a mobile application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. While this tutorial focuses on the computer interface, the operation is exactly the same on mobile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Navigating the Payoneer Interface

Upon logging in, you will see an interactive menu on the left side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This menu displays different sections and your user ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Key navigation and support features include:
*   **Notifications:** Access configured notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Customer Support:** Access customer support, which offers help in multiple languages including Spanish and English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

*   **Profile Settings:** Configure your name, verify your account, and log out from your profile settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

The main menu on the left includes sections like:
*   Beginning (Home) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>
*   Receiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

## [[types_of_payoneer_accounts_and_their_differences | Types of Payoneer Accounts]]

There are two main types of accounts within Payoneer:
1.  **Individual/Private Account:** For personal use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
2.  **Company Account:** For businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

A key difference is that transfers to a business account must originate from another company account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. You cannot make a transfer from a personal account to a business account on Payoneer, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The originating account must be compatible with the receiving Payoneer account type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## [[managing_currencies_and_bank_accounts_in_payoneer | Managing Currencies and Bank Accounts]]

Payoneer allows users to hold different currencies within the platform, such as US Dollars, Euros, and British Pounds Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Under the "Banks & Cards" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, you can manage "receiving accounts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Each currency held is associated with a bank account that automatically opens within Payoneer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, accounts are available for the Eurozone, United Kingdom, and United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These accounts provide specific bank details (e.g., account number, bank name like Banking Circle) that can be copied for transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

You can request additional accounts with different currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. By default, new accounts typically open with British Pounds and US Dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. These associated bank accounts are crucial for requesting payments from clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Key Account Actions

From the main menu, you can:
*   View balances and transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Request a payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Make a payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Request a new currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Payments and Withdrawals

Payoneer facilitates various payment options:
*   **Paying others:** Pay to other Payoneer accounts or recipient bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Managing recipients:** Manage accounts of those you pay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Batch payments:** Make payments to multiple recipients at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Business payments:** Pay Amazon advertising bills or VAT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

For withdrawals and transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>:
*   **Transfer to bank:** Withdraw funds to your linked bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Manage currencies:** Convert funds from one currency to another (e.g., Euros to Dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This process involves a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Account Activity and Business Network

The "Account Activity" section allows you to view transactions, payment requests, and generate monthly statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Monthly statements can be useful for tax declaration in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

For company accounts, the "Business Network" allows you to manage stores, see companies you work with, view connected business applications, and refer friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Commissions

Commissions associated with the Payoneer platform vary depending on the type of transaction you perform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. It is recommended to check the specific commission rates before executing transactions, as they are generally not very high but can influence whether a transaction is worthwhile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Information on commissions can be found in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

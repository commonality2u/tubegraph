When purchasing a second-hand iPhone, it is crucial to verify its status to ensure it has not been reported as stolen or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This process relies on checking the device's IMEI (International Mobile Equipment Identity) number, which is referred to as an "email number" in the context of this tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## What is an IMEI Number?

An IMEI number is the identification number for an Apple device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Every Apple device has one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. If an iPhone is lost or stolen, its IMEI number can be reported to Apple, registering it as a lost, disappeared, or stolen device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This allows others to check the device's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Requirements for Checking an iPhone's Status

To check if an iPhone is stolen, you will need two main things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>:
1.  **Access to a specific web page:** This web page, which is typically provided in the first comment of related video tutorials, allows for device status verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This falls under [[using_online_tools_to_verify_an_iphones_status | using online tools to verify an iPhone's status]].
2.  **The mobile device's IMEI number:** This identification number is essential for the check <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## How to find the IMEI Number(s)

The IMEI number can typically be found in multiple locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>:
*   On the device's casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
*   On the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

A common place to find it on the device itself is within the settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
1.  Open **Settings** on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Go to **General** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
3.  Tap on **Information** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
4.  Scroll down to find the IMEI number(s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. These are the [[steps_to_check_email_number_of_an_iphone | steps to check the IMEI number of an iPhone]].

### Dual SIM Devices

It's important to note that if your iPhone has Dual SIM capability, it will have two IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This means there is one IMEI associated with each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If your device has two SIM cards, you must check both IMEI numbers to ensure neither is reported as stolen or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### For Locked or New Devices

If your device is locked, or if you are buying a new device that has been reset, the method for finding the IMEI may differ slightly. Instructions are often provided via screenshots in tutorials for such cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Checking the IMEI Online

Once you have the IMEI number(s), you can use the designated web page to verify the device's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>:
1.  Navigate to the web page.
2.  Copy and paste the IMEI number into the provided field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
3.  Check the "I am not a robot" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  Initiate the check. The page will then inform you if the IMEI is reported, stolen, or otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   For example, a result might state "activated," "Finding the iPhone," "unlocked," and "not stolen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, indicating the device is clear. The iPhone model is also typically displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
5.  If checking a dual SIM device, repeat the process for the second IMEI number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

By following these steps, you can confidently verify the status of an iPhone, especially important when considering a second-hand purchase.

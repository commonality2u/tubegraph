It is important to know that not all videos can be sent via WhatsApp due to a capacity limit [00:00:17]. [[video_compression | Video compression]] is a process that allows you to reduce the size of a video file, enabling it to be sent without issues [00:00:26].

## Requirements for Video Compression

To compress videos for WhatsApp, you will need to meet two main requirements:

1.  **Download a [[video_compression_tools_available_in_app_stores | Video Compression App]]**:
    *   Go to your device's app store (e.g., App Store) [00:00:47].
    *   Search for "Video Compressor" [00:00:50].
    *   While many options are available, the recommended app is "Video Compressor" (as shown in the tutorial) because it typically has less advertising and fewer payment requirements compared to other options [01:04].

## [[step_by_step_video_compression_tutorial | Step-by-Step Video Compression]]

Once you have downloaded the recommended application, follow these steps to compress your video:

1.  **Open the Application**: Launch the "Video Compressor" app on your device [01:27].
2.  **Select "Compress a Video"**: The app will provide an option to compress a video [01:29].
3.  **Choose Your Video**:
    *   Navigate to your video gallery [01:36].
    *   Select the video you wish to compress [01:41]. For example, a three-minute video that is 34 megabytes in size [01:45].
4.  **Adjust Compression Settings**:
    *   The app will display "indices of compression," allowing you to determine how much you want to compress the video [01:53].
    *   The percentage indicates the reduction from the original video size [02:04]. A smaller percentage means greater compression [02:09].
    *   The goal is to reduce the size enough to send via WhatsApp while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining acceptable quality]] [02:44].
    *   A setting like 70% compression can reduce the file size significantly (e.g., from 34.6 megabytes to 29.4 megabytes when starting at 85%, or a 10-megabyte reduction at 70%) [02:12, 02:52].
    *   You can also adjust playback speed, with options for "normal mode" (automatic reduction) or "advanced mode" (manual adjustments) [02:23].
5.  **Initiate Compression**: Click the "Compress" button [02:59].
6.  **Wait for Compression to Complete**: The compression process typically takes about 20-30 seconds [03:01].
7.  **Save the Compressed Video**: Once compressed, you will have the option to save the video to your device's gallery [03:32].

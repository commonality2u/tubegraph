Videos often have a capacity limit when being sent via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. To overcome this, videos can be compressed to [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reduce their file size]] while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining acceptable quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>.

## Requirements

To compress videos for WhatsApp, you will need a [[video_compression_apps_for_mobile_devices | video compressor app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

### Finding a Video Compressor App

1.  Open the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:47">[00:47:47]</a>.
2.  Search for "Video Compressor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>.
3.  While many options are available, look for one that offers minimal advertising and fewer payment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>. The tutorial recommends a specific [[video_compression_apps_for_mobile_devices | video compressor app]] that fits these criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
4.  Download the recommended app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | Step-by-Step Guide on Using a Video Compressor]]

This guide outlines the process of [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | compressing videos]] using a dedicated app:

1.  **Open the Application**: Launch the [[video_compression_apps_for_mobile_devices | video compressor application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.
2.  **Select Video**: Tap on the option to [[features_of_a_video_compressor_app | compress a video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:31">[01:31:31]</a>. Navigate to your video gallery and select the video you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. For example, a 3-minute video that is 34 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:45">[01:45:45]</a>.
3.  **Adjust Compression Settings**:
    *   The app will present "indices of compression," allowing you to choose how much to compress the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:53">[01:53:53]</a>.
    *   A higher percentage typically means greater compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:09">[02:09:09]</a>. For instance, compressing at 85% might reduce a 34.6 MB video to 29.4 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:12">[02:12:12]</a>.
    *   The "normal mode" will automatically reduce the video's rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>, but manual adjustment is also possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:36">[02:36:36]</a>.
    *   Aim to [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reduce the size]] enough for WhatsApp while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining acceptable quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:44">[02:44:44]</a>. A 70% compression rate is recommended, as it can result in a significant size reduction (e.g., 10 megabytes) while preserving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:52">[02:52:52]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Compression**: Tap "compress" to start the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. The compression typically takes around 20-30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:05">[03:05:05]</a>.
5.  **Save the Compressed Video**: Once compression is complete, save the video. It will be stored in your device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:32">[03:32:32]</a>.

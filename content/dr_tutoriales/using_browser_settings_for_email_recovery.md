This guide explains how to recover your email account or password using your browser's saved settings, particularly when you have forgotten your [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Gmail account recovery methods | Gmail]] email or password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This method is effective if you've previously accessed your account from the device you are currently using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Prerequisite: Accessing from a Known Device

Before attempting recovery, ensure you are using a computer or mobile phone from which you have previously accessed your email account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Google uses your access history as a reference to help restore your password or provide a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Recovering Email Accounts and Passwords via Google Chrome Settings

If you've forgotten both your email address and password, or just your password, you can try to retrieve them from your Google Chrome settings.

### Steps to Access Saved Credentials:

1.  **Open Google Chrome:** Launch a new Google Chrome window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Settings:**
    *   Open a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   Go to the right side of the browser window and select "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This is part of [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | Google Chrome's advanced settings navigation]] and [[google_chrome_privacy_and_security_settings | privacy and security settings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
3.  **Access Password Section:**
    *   Within "Settings," navigate to the "Autofill" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   Select the "Passwords" option to view all saved passwords for various accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
4.  **Search for Gmail Accounts:**
    *   In the "Search passwords" bar, type "gmail" to filter the saved accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This will display a list of all [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Gmail]] accounts and their corresponding saved passwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
5.  **View Password:**
    *   Click on the "eye" icon next to the desired account to reveal the password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   You may be prompted to enter your computer's PIN for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   Once the PIN is entered, the password will appear alongside the email account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> This method is highly effective if you have previously accessed your email account from the device you are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It can be used for both [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Gmail account recovery methods | recovering an email account]] you've forgotten and [[recovering_gmail_password | recovering Gmail passwords]] if you only remember the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

If this browser-based method does not work, Google offers [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | other recovery methods]], including using a phone number, [[alternative_recovery_options_like_phone_number_or_secondary_email | alternative recovery options like phone number or secondary email | a secondary recovery email]], or [[google_security_questions_for_account_recovery | Google security questions for account recovery | security questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

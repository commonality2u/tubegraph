VLC Media Player is a versatile program that not only plays video files but also allows for editing and compression, enabling [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reduction of video file size]] without significant loss of quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is particularly useful for transferring files via services like [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] or email, or to save storage space on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Getting Started

To compress videos using VLC, ensure you have the program installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | Step-by-Step Guide on Using a Video Compressor]]

To compress a video file while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining video quality]], follow these steps:

1.  **Open with VLC**: Open the video file you wish to compress with VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Access Conversion Menu**:
    *   Navigate to "Media" (Medio) in the top left corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Select "Convert / Save..." (Convertir / Guardar...) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Add File**:
    *   In the new screen, click "Add..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Browse and select the video file you want to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Click "Open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Conversion**: Click the "Convert / Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Key [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | Compression Settings]]

Configuring the correct settings is crucial for achieving optimal compression without quality degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

1.  **Profile Selection**:
    *   Choose "Video â€“ H.264 + MP3 (MP4)" as the profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  **Access Profile Settings**: Click the "Tools" (Tools) icon next to the profile dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

    ### Encapsulation
    *   Ensure "MP4/MOV" is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

    ### Video Codec
    *   **Codec**: Select "H.264" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Bitrate**: Set to "Same as source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   **Resolution**: Crucially, set the "Scale" to "1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. Leave "Height" and "Width" on "Automatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   **Filters**: Do not touch any settings in the "Filters" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

    ### Audio Codec
    *   It is recommended to keep the audio settings as "Original Audio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a> to prevent audio loss during conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

3.  **Save Settings**: Once configured, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

## [[exporting_and_saving_compressed_video_files | Exporting and Saving]]

1.  **Destination File**:
    *   Click "Browse" next to the "Destination file" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Choose a location to save your compressed video and give it a new name (e.g., "compressed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  **Start Compression**: Click "Start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

VLC will then begin the compression process, indicated by a progress bar in the main playback window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The duration of this process depends on the video's length <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Once the bar reaches the end, the conversion is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Compression Results

As an example, a video file originally 1.93 GB in HD quality was compressed to 384 MB using these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This represents a reduction of more than 50% in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Upon playback, both the audio and video quality remained good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This demonstrates that [[video_compression_using_vlc | video compression using VLC]] can significantly reduce file size without compromising the viewing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

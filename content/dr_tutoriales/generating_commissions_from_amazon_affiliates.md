The Amazon Affiliates program allows individuals to [[generating_revenue_through_amazon_affiliate_program | earn commissions]] by promoting Amazon products. Participants can [[creating_amazon_affiliate_links | obtain Amazon affiliate links]] and share them with others; when a purchase is made through these links, a commission is earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This system allows for the generation of commissions from sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Prerequisites

To begin, you must have an [[using_amazon_affiliate_account | Amazon Affiliates account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. If you do not have an account, the process of [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | creating one]] is described as super easy and simple, taking approximately five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Methods for Obtaining Amazon Affiliate Links

There are two primary [[methods_for_obtaining_amazon_affiliate_links | methods for obtaining Amazon affiliate links]]:

### 1. Through the Amazon Affiliates Platform

This method involves [[navigating_the_amazon_affiliates_platform | accessing the Amazon Affiliates platform]] directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

*   **Accessing Product Links**: On the Amazon Affiliates screen, navigate to the "product links" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Searching for Products**: Utilize the search engine to find any product available on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For example, searching for "Call of Duty PlayStation 4" will display all related products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The system indicates the number of search results found, such as 845 results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Generating Links**:
    *   **Long Link**: For any desired product, an arrow option provides a "great size" link that can be copied and pasted. This link allows others to purchase the product, and you earn a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Short Link**: If a shorter, more visual link is preferred, clicking the arrow again reveals an option to "shorten the URL" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This provides a more concise Amazon Affiliates link that is easy to copy and paste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### 2. Using the Amazon Affiliate Web Bar

This method is considered intuitive and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

*   **Accessing the Web Bar**: Once logged into your Amazon Affiliates account, go to the main Amazon product page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. A "superior taskbar" or "Amazon Web Bar Affiliates" should appear at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This utility is exclusive to registered Amazon Affiliates accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
*   **Generating Links from Product Pages**: While browsing any product on Amazon, the Amazon Affiliate Web Bar provides options to obtain a link directly from that page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
    *   **Text Format Link**: Selecting "text format" allows you to choose the affiliate ID (CAID) and monitoring ID. You can also choose between a short or full link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   **Text Plus Image Link**: This option provides a different link and can be configured to open the Amazon product in a new tab when clicked. This is useful as it prevents visitors from losing your website's tracking while redirecting them to Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Promoting Products

Once obtained, these links can be placed on your website or other promotional pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For WordPress users, a plugin can be used to [[advertising_amazon_products_with_wordpress_plugins | advertise Amazon products]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. By promoting these links, you facilitate purchases and earn commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

This guide explains how to install YouTube as an application on your PC and then pin it to your taskbar for easy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Installing YouTube on Your PC

To begin, you'll need to install YouTube as an app on your computer:
1.  Open any search engine, such as [[using_google_chrome_to_loop_youtube_videos | Google Chrome]], Edge, Opera, or Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.
2.  Navigate directly to the YouTube main page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
3.  Look for the "install YouTube" option, usually indicated by a download symbol, and click it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
4.  Confirm the installation of the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
5.  The application will then download and install <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

After the installation, a [[creating_a_youtube_shortcut_on_pc | shortcut]] for YouTube will be created on your desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. You can also find the app by searching for "YouTube" in your PC's search bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Pinning YouTube to the Taskbar

Once YouTube is installed, you can pin it to your taskbar:
1.  Locate the YouTube app icon, either on your desktop or through the search bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Right-click on the YouTube icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
3.  Select the option to "anchor to the taskbar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
4.  The YouTube icon will now appear on your taskbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

You can now open YouTube directly from the taskbar, and it will access your registered Google/Channel account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Uninstalling YouTube (Optional)

If you need to uninstall the YouTube application:
1.  Go to your computer's Control Panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Click on "uninstall program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

To pin the YouTube application to your PC's taskbar, you first need to have the YouTube application installed on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can be done by accessing the YouTube page via a search engine like [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> and selecting the "Install YouTube" option, which often appears with a download symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Locating the YouTube Application

Once [[downloading_youtube_on_pc | YouTube is downloaded]] and installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>, a shortcut is typically created on your desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Alternatively, you can find the application by typing "YouTube" directly into the PC's search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Pinning to the Taskbar

To pin YouTube to your taskbar:
1.  Locate the YouTube application either via the desktop shortcut or through the search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
2.  Right-click on the YouTube application icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  Select the option to "anchor to the taskbar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

After these steps, the YouTube icon will remain on your taskbar for easy access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

This tutorial explains how to purchase Binance Coin (BNB) on the Binance Exchange using a personal computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The process is designed to be as easy and simple as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Getting Started

Before beginning, it's recommended to use a referral link provided in the first video comment to create a Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This link offers a 10% discount on all commissions for deposits, transactions, and withdrawals, which can save a significant amount of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

The speaker also mentions a video series explaining how to generate profitability from cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, particularly how to invest them to earn compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This series is available in a linked playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, which is relevant for [[using_binance_for_cryptocurrency_investments | using Binance for cryptocurrency investments]].

## Steps to Buy BNB on PC

1.  **Navigate to Markets:** Once on the Binance website, go to the "Markets" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
2.  **Search for BNB:**
    *   Within the "Markets" section, go to the "Zones" area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   Select "Everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Search for "BNB" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. BNB Coin is typically ranked fourth in capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Trading:** Select BNB and click "Operate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This will open a new tab displaying a graph of BNB, often compared with USD (USDT), which is a cryptocurrency mimicking the dollar's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
4.  **Choose a Trading Pair:** While BNB/USD (USDT) is common, you can select other pairs. Click the downward arrow to see available exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, such as BNB/Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Selecting a pair opens its specific chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
5.  **Place an Order:**
    *   Focus on the "Place Order" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Here, you can buy or sell, and choose different order types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   Available order types include: Limit, Market, Stop-Limit, and OCO (One Cancels the Other) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
    *   For an immediate purchase, select the **Market Order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This buys the cryptocurrency at its current real-time market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
    *   If you are unfamiliar with these order types, the speaker recommends a separate tutorial on how to use them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

    > If you don't know how to use order types, stay with this video, and then you learn how they work. I recommend it one hundred percent, already that we have to get familiar with this platform, the most possible. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>

6.  **Specify Amount:**
    *   You can choose the exact amount of BNB you wish to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, or the total amount in your chosen currency (e.g., Euros) you want to spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
    *   For example, to buy 1,000 Euros worth of BNB, enter "1000" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
7.  **Complete Purchase:** Click "Buy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. The BNB will then be purchased and appear in your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Locating Your Purchased BNB

After buying BNB, it will appear in your "Spot Wallet" within the "Wallet" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### BNB Vault

If your BNB is not immediately visible in your Spot Wallet, it might be because you have invested it in a product like [[how_to_use_bnb_vault_on_binance | BNB Vault]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. BNB Vault offers profitability on your BNB holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. To check your invested BNB, navigate to the "Earn" section of your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

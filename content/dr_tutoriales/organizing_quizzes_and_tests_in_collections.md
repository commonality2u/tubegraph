Quizizz allows users to organize quizzes and tests into "collections," which serve as folders for grouping related educational content. These collections can contain tests you have created yourself or tests you have saved from other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing Collections
After [[how_to_register_and_set_up_a_quizizz_account_for_teachers | registering and setting up a Quizizz account as a teacher]], you can access the "Collections" option from the left panel in the Quizizz interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This section displays all the collections you have created or saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

## Creating a New Collection
To create a new collection:
1. Navigate to a quiz or test you wish to save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
2. Select the option to "Save" the quiz. If it's not yet in a collection, you will be prompted to create one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
3. Choose to "create a collection" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.
4. Assign a name to your new collection, for example, "Math Fractions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
5. Click "Create" to finalize the collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

## Adding Quizzes to a Collection
Once a collection is created, you can save new or existing quizzes into it.
1. When viewing a quiz, select the "Save" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
2. Choose the desired collection from your existing list (e.g., "Mathematics fractions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
3. The quiz will then be stored within that collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

Organizing quizzes into collections helps teachers manage their educational content, making it easier to find and reuse tests for different themes or classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

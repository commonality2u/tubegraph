Binance offers "Flexible Savings" as a way to earn [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_binance_savings | profitability]] on owned cryptocurrencies [00:00:12]. This feature allows users to make their assets productive [00:03:35]. Before engaging, it's advised to study the market and the profitability offered by these savings options to make informed investment decisions [00:00:20].

## Accessing Flexible Savings

To access Flexible Savings:
1.  Navigate to the "Finance" section on the Binance Exchange [00:01:18].
2.  Select the "Savings" option [00:01:20]. This section aggregates various programs designed to help users earn [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_binance_savings | profitability]] from their cryptocurrencies [00:01:27].
3.  Within the savings page, three primary options are presented: Flexible Savings, [[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked Savings]], and Activities [00:02:03].

## Understanding Flexible Savings

Flexible Savings are characterized by their adaptability:
*   **Flexibility**: Users can deposit and withdraw their cryptocurrency at any time they wish [00:02:34].
*   **Interest Rate**: A more or less fixed annual interest rate is received [00:03:40]. While generally consistent, this rate can vary [00:03:43]. For example, Bitcoin might offer an annual profitability of 1.20% [00:02:27].
*   **Lower Returns**: The [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_binance_savings | returns]] from Flexible Savings are typically lower compared to [[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked Savings]] [00:03:37].

## How to Subscribe to Flexible Savings

The process involves providing a chosen cryptocurrency to Binance in exchange for an annual return [00:02:19]. An example using Cardano (ADA) illustrates the steps:
1.  Select the desired cryptocurrency (e.g., Cardano) [00:04:46].
2.  Enter the amount to transfer. There is a minimum amount required, which should be greater than a certain division, and a maximum subscription limit [00:04:57].
3.  Accept the terms. Users can access the flexible interest calculation rules for more details [00:05:11].
4.  Be aware of subscription closure times for flexible products, which occur during UTC 23:50:00 to 00:00:10 [00:05:23].
5.  No interest is received on the day of subscription or deposit; interest calculation begins from the second day [00:05:33].
6.  Agree to the service agreement and confirm the transfer and deposit [00:05:42].
7.  Upon successful subscription, the capital will begin producing daily profitability from the next day [00:06:01].

## Monitoring Flexible Savings

After subscribing, deposited capital and accumulated [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_binance_savings | interest]] can be monitored:
1.  Go to the "Wallet" section [00:06:26].
2.  Within the wallet, find various tabs, including "Flexible," "Locked," "Activities," and "Test Fund for Savings" [00:06:32].
3.  Under the "Flexible" tab, users can see the total amount deposited, today's subscription, accumulated interest, and the option to redeem their assets [00:06:40].
4.  The "Redeem" option allows users to retrieve their deposited capital along with any accumulated interest [00:06:49].

## Recommendations

Flexible Savings are recommended when the deposited money is not immediately needed, or for very long-term investments where access to funds might be required [00:03:51]. While it is not considered a high-risk product, users should be aware that if the currency depreciates, they cannot withdraw their capital instantly if it were in a [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] product [00:04:27]. With flexible savings, withdrawal is always an option [00:03:59]. It is important to always keep assets active and producing more money [00:07:32].

Binance offers various programs to help users generate profitability from their cryptocurrencies, including savings options that can be either flexible or locked [00:01:23]. It is important to study the market and the profitability these savings options offer to make informed investment decisions [00:00:20].

## Accessing Flexible Savings

To access savings options on Binance, navigate to the "Finance" section and then select "Savings" [00:01:18]. Within this section, you will find options like flexible terms, fixed terms, and high-risk products [00:01:32]. To specifically manage flexible savings, click on "Flexible Savings" [00:01:51]. The savings page presents three main options: [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | flexible savings]], [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]], and activities [00:02:03].

## What are Flexible Savings?

Flexible savings allow users to provide a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, and receive an annual profitability rate [00:02:19]. For instance, the annual profitability for Bitcoin was 1.20% [00:02:25].

The primary characteristic of flexible savings is the ability to deposit or withdraw your currency whenever you choose [00:02:34]. The interest rate is generally stable, though it can vary [00:03:40]. Returns from flexible savings are typically lower compared to [[locked_savings_on_binance | locked savings]] [00:03:37]. This option is available for various cryptocurrencies, including Cardano (ADA) [00:04:41].

## How to Deposit into Flexible Savings

To deposit into flexible savings:
1.  Select the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit, such as Cardano (ADA) [00:04:46].
2.  Enter the desired amount; there is a minimum amount required for subscription [00:04:57]. For example, you could deposit 100 Cardano [00:05:05].
3.  Before confirming, you can access the rules for flexible interest calculation if you wish to review them further [00:05:11].
4.  Be aware that flexible products are closed for subscription during UTC 23:50 to 00:10 [00:05:23].
5.  No interest is accrued on the day of subscription or deposit; interest calculation begins from the second day [00:05:33].
6.  You must agree to the service terms [00:05:42].
7.  Confirm the transfer to successfully deposit your amount [00:05:48].

## Managing Your Flexible Savings

To check your flexible savings and manage them, go to the "Wallet" section and then navigate to the "Savings" tab [00:06:25]. Within the savings tab, select "Flexible" [00:06:37]. Here, you can view your total deposited amount, today's subscription, accumulated interest (which may initially be zero), and an option to "redeem" your capital along with any accumulated interest [00:06:42].

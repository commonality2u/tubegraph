After [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | creating a form]] or survey in Google Forms, you can manage the responses you receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Accessing Responses

To manage responses, navigate to the "Responses" section within your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This section is visible on the right side of the Google Forms interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. When a new form is first created, there will be no responses yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Configuration Options for Responses

Within the "Responses" tab, you can adjust several settings that influence how responses are collected and managed:

*   **Collecting Email Addresses**: You have the option to collect the email addresses of individuals who fill out the survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This can be useful for verifying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Sending Copies of Replies**: You can configure the form to send respondents a copy of their submitted answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This requires enabling email collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Allowing Answer Modification**: You can decide whether respondents are allowed to modify their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. By default, this might not be desired for a survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Limiting to One Response per Person**: By default, people can fill out a survey as many times as they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For surveys where only one response per person is required (e.g., for a degree project), you can enable a setting to limit responses to once per person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Viewing and Analyzing Responses

While the initial setup of the "Responses" section is covered, more detailed information on [[how_to_view_responses_in_google_forms | how to view responses]] in a concrete way, or how results are presented, is covered in other tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Related Features
> For advanced features like limiting the time respondents have to answer a survey, a plugin is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This functionality is typically free and simple to implement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.# Managing Survey Responses in Google Forms

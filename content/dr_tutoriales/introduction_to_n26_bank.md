N26 is a bank designed for efficient and useful operation, particularly known for not charging commissions on domestic or international transfers, which can be a problem with many traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This feature makes it highly recommended for those making transfers to countries like the UK or USA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Account Setup and Access
For new users, a previous video tutorial details the step-by-step process of [[account_setup_and_transfers_with_n26 | creating an N26 account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Using a referral code provided in the video's description can grant new users five euros upon opening an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

The [[features_of_n26_bank_app | N26 bank application]] is available for both iPhone and Android devices, with an identical interface across both operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The application is typically found within the finance section on a user's device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Account Types
N26 offers various account types, including a free "Standard" or "basic" account that incurs no monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Other account types with additional features are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>, such as N26 and N26 Metal, which include more free withdrawals and subaccounts, but come with monthly fees (e.g., N26 Metal for seventeen euros/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

## [[n26_app_menu_navigation_and_setup | N26 App Menu Navigation]]
The [[n26_app_menu_navigation_and_setup | N26 application]] features two primary menus:
*   **Lower Menu**: Includes "start," "spaces," "exploring," and "cards" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Upper Menu**: Provides options to view the profile, access help/questions, view statistics, upcoming payments, statements, and search for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### Profile Section
The profile section displays account details such as the IBAN and offers a QR code for immediate transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Users can activate visibility to allow other N26 users to send money instantly via QR code, phone number, or email, similar to mobile-to-mobile transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Within the profile, users can also:
*   Invite friends to N26, offering five euros for new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   Access "Configuration" for personal information, app settings (like language and proximity sensor mode), security settings (PIN, password), and marketing communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Initiate a bank change to redirect addresses and payments to an N26 account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, though some users might prefer to keep their national bank and use N26 as an intermediary for free international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Help and Support
The "questions" section provides access to help, including a chat feature that can connect users with a robot or a physical person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Access to private chat information requires verification with a paired device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Balance and Transactions
The app displays the current balance, which can be made visible or invisible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Users can view all transactions through the magnifying glass icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Money Management with N26
The [[features_of_n26_bank_app | N26 application]] offers several ways to manage funds:

### Receiving Money
Users can receive money via:
*   Bank transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   Debit or credit card to PLP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>
*   Requesting money with a QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>

### Sending Money
Options for sending money include:
*   **MoneyBeam**: Instant transfers to other N26 account holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Bank transfer**: Totally free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Foreign currency transfer**: Also totally free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, which is a key benefit of [[using_bank_n26_for_commission_savings | using N26 for commission savings]].
*   **Scan QR code**: For direct payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Donations**: Option to donate to Women for Women International <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

### Adding Funds
A physical card is issued once there are at least ten euros in the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. The first instant transfer via credit or debit card to fund the N26 account is free, making it beneficial to deposit a larger amount initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## [[card_and_space_management_in_n26 | Card Management]]
Users can request a physical card for ATM withdrawals and in-store payments where mobile payment is not accepted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. The standard delivery of a physical card costs ten euros and takes about two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. Express delivery is available within three business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Virtual Cards and Mobile Wallets
Upon funding the account, a virtual card is immediately active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This virtual card can be added to mobile wallets like Apple Wallet (for iPhone) or Android (for Android devices) for mobile payments even before the physical card arrives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. The process for adding the card to a mobile wallet is similar across both operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### Card Settings
The app offers comprehensive card management options, allowing users to:
*   View card information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>
*   Lock the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>
*   Adjust card settings, such as enabling or disabling payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>
*   Activate or deactivate the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>

## Spaces (Subaccounts)
N26 offers "Spaces" as subaccounts to organize money and set savings goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Users can create, delete, and move money between spaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. While the free Standard account typically includes a limited trial period for Spaces (e.g., 59 or 60 days), this feature is primarily designed for premium account holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Spaces allow for diversifying a portfolio, for example, by creating a space for saving and another for spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

## Explore Section and Offers
The "Explore" section displays available offers and details about the user's contracted service (e.g., N26 Standard) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. It also provides information on different N26 account types and their benefits, such as free withdrawals, commission-free worldwide payments, and chat support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. Exclusive offers, which are updated regularly (e.g., 30% off at Reebok), are often more accessible to premium plan subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

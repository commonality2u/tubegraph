## Requirements for Uploading Longer Videos on YouTube

YouTube channels that have not enabled specific permissions are generally restricted from [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | uploading videos]] with a duration greater than fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. If an attempt is made to upload a video longer than this limit without the permission, the video will block at 99% processing and will not allow the upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is not a mistake but a necessary permission for new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Enabling Longer Video Uploads

To enable the ability to [[how_to_upload_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos longer than 15 minutes]], a channel needs to activate a specific permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

The steps to enable this permission are:

1.  **Access YouTube Studio**
    *   Navigate to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] for the channel on which you wish to upload longer videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
    *   Switch to the "classic version" of [[youtube_studio_features_for_enabling_long_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], as this can expedite the enabling process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Channel Settings**
    *   In the classic version, click on the "Channel" option located in the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   This section displays various permissions and options for the channel, such as [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | uploading videos and live broadcasting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
3.  **Locate "Longer Videos" Feature**
    *   Find the option related to "longer lasting videos" (which translates to "longer videos" or "videos longer than 15 minutes") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   For channels where this feature is not yet enabled, it typically shows as "No" or not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
4.  **Complete the Verification Process**
    *   To enable the feature, you must perform a [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | verification process]] for your YouTube account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This can be done via computer, Android, or iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   YouTube will send a confirmation code to your mobile phone number, Gmail account, or registered email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
    *   You will use this confirmation code to verify that you are the owner of the [[requirements_for_youtube_channel_verification | YouTube account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Once this verification process is completed and the feature is enabled, you will be able to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos]] with a duration greater than fifteen minutes without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

YouTube allows users to [[sharing_private_youtube_videos | create private videos]] that are only viewable by specific individuals chosen by the uploader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This ensures that only desired recipients can access the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Setting a Video to Private

To make a video private, you must first access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

1.  Navigate to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Video" section of your [[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | channel]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
3.  Choose the video you wish to make private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  In the "Visibility" setting for that video, select "Private" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Understanding Private Visibility

A video set to "Private" will not appear on your public [[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | channel]] page or in YouTube search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. It will only be accessible to the specific individuals you choose to share it with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Sharing Private Videos

Once a video's visibility is set to private, you can share it with others:

1.  From the "Video" section in [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]], click the "pen" icon (details) next to the private video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This leads to the video's details page.
2.  On the video details page, locate the three dots in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
3.  Click the three dots and select "Share privately" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
4.  A new tab will open, allowing you to add email addresses to a mailing list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Enter the email addresses of the people you want to view the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
5.  Click "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Recipient Experience

Individuals added to the sharing list will receive an email from YouTube containing a link to the private video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The email will state that the [[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | channel]] invites them to watch a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. By clicking on this link, they can access and view the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

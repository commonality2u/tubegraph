It can be used to compress video files without losing quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This process is useful for transferring large files via WhatsApp, mail, or other means, or to save memory on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## How to Compress a Video File with VLC

1.  **Open the video with VLC**: Once the video is open in VLC, pause it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  **Access the Conversion Tool**:
    *   Navigate to the "Media" menu on the left side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Select "Convert/Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Add the Video File**:
    *   In the new screen that appears, click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Select the video track you wish to convert and compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Click "Open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
    *   Click the "Convert/Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
4.  **Configure Conversion Settings**: This is a critical step to maintain quality while compressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
    *   **Profile**: Select **H.264 + MP3** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Tools/Options (Wrench Icon)**: Click the wrench icon next to the profile to access detailed settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
        *   **Encapsulation**: Must be **MP4/MOV** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
        *   **Video Codec**:
            *   Codec: **H.264** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
            *   Bitrate: Unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
            *   Quality: Unused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
            *   Scale: **Scale 1** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a> (This is very important for resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>).
            *   Filters: No changes needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
            *   Height and Width: Automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
        *   **Audio Codec**: It's recommended to keep the audio as **original audio** to prevent audio loss during conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" once settings are configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
5.  **Choose Export Location and Name**:
    *   Select the destination folder for the compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Give the compressed file a name (e.g., "compressed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   Click "Start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
6.  **Monitor Conversion**: VLC will initiate the process, showing a loading bar. The conversion is complete when the bar reaches the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Compression Results

In a test case, a video file from the Dark series, originally 1.93 GB in HD quality with multiple audio tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, was compressed to 384 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This represents a reduction of almost 50% from the initial size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The quality of the video and the audio were maintained after compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

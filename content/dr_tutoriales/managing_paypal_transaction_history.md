This guide explains how to manage and view your transaction history within the PayPal platform, covering both sending and receiving money, and the details available for each transaction.

## Viewing Transaction History
After logging into the PayPal platform, you can view your transaction history. If you go to the "beginning part," you can see the "history of the transaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:08">[03:40:08]</a>. Your recent activity will show details of payments, such as the amount sent or received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:04">[03:47:04]</a>. For example, if you send money, your balance will update, and the recent activity will show the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:55">[03:42:55]</a>.

On the recipient's side, once money is received, it will appear in the [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:36">[04:22:36]</a>. The activity section will show details such as the sender's account name, the amount received, and the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>.

## Transaction Details
When you view a specific transaction in your activity, details provided include:
*   **Status** The status of the transaction (e.g., "unclaimed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:36">[03:53:36]</a>.
*   **Transaction ID** A unique identifier for the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:04">[03:55:04]</a>.
*   **Contact Information** Related contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:13">[03:57:13]</a>.
*   **Funds** Information regarding the funds involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:36">[03:58:36]</a>.

This information provides a "resolution" of the transaction that has been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:27">[04:00:27]</a>.

## Printing Receipts
For any executed transaction, you have the option to print a receipt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:47">[04:04:47]</a>. This allows you to have a physical copy of the transaction record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>.

## Sending Money
To send money from one [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal account]] to another, you typically use the "send money" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. You will need to enter the [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal contact]], which can be a username or email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:47">[01:40:47]</a>. After entering the recipient's email, you will input the amount to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:37">[01:57:37]</a>. You can also add a note to indicate what the payment is for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:50">[02:03:50]</a>.

When sending money, you'll choose the purpose of the payment:
*   **For a friend:** This option is often free when paying in euros within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>.
*   **For an article or service:** This option is used for purchases, and the seller typically pays a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a>. Payments for goods or services may be covered by [[buyer_protection_and_transaction_security_on_paypal | PayPal's buyer protection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:02">[02:34:02]</a>. It's recommended to review the [[buyer_protection_and_transaction_security_on_paypal | buyer protection conditions]] if you are buying or selling items to prevent issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:08">[03:07:08]</a>.

Payment can typically be made from your [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal balance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:15">[03:19:15]</a>.

## Setting Up a PayPal Account
If you don't have a [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal account]] yet, it can be created in a few simple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:14">[00:58:14]</a>. It is not necessary to [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | link a bank account]] or any card during the initial setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>. The process for creating an account and sending money is similar on both computers and mobile phones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>.

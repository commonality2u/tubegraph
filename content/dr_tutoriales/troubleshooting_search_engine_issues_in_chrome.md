This guide provides steps to [[setting_google_as_default_search_engine_in_google_chrome | set Google as your default search engine]] in Google Chrome and address common issues where other search engines might appear instead of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Identifying the Problem

Sometimes, after downloading extensions or programs, your default search engine in Google Chrome might inadvertently change from Google to another service like Yahoo, Bing, or Ecosia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This happens when you unintentionally accept a change during the installation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Setting Google as Your Default Search Engine

To change your default search engine to Google:

1.  **Access Settings**:
    *   Open Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
    *   Click on the three dots located in the top right corner of the browser window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Navigate to "Settings" (or "Configuración" if your browser is in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

2.  **Go to Search Engine Options**:
    *   A new tab will open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   From the left-hand menu, select "Search engine" (which translates to "Motor de búsqueda" in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
    *   This section displays the search engines currently in use, such as Yahoo or Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

3.  **[[managing_search_engine_settings_in_google_chrome | Manage Search Engines]]**:
    *   Within the "Search engine" section, click on "Manage Search Engines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Here you will see a list of installed search engines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Google should appear as an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

4.  **[[editing_and_adding_new_search_engines_in_chrome | Editing and Adding New Search Engines]]**:
    *   If Google is not listed as your default, or if you need to add it, you can edit existing entries or add a new one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
    *   To edit an existing search engine (e.g., Bing), click the pencil icon next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. You can change its name and the associated URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
    *   To add Google, you will need to input specific data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
        *   Click the pencil icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
        *   For the name, enter "Google" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
        *   For the shortcut, enter "Google.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It is crucial to use ".com" to avoid potential issues in different countries (e.g., if you are not in Spain or England, "Google.es" or "Google.co.uk" might cause problems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
    *   Once you've made changes, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

>[!NOTE]
>There is no additional save button required after configuring these settings, as changes are applied automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

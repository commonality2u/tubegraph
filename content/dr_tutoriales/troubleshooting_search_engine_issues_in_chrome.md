It's common for Google Chrome's default search engine to change unexpectedly, often to alternatives like Yahoo or Bing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This can happen after installing certain [[Using Google Chrome extensions for transcription | extensions]] or programs that inadvertently alter your browser settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Fortunately, [[changing_default_search_settings | changing default search settings]] back to Google is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Identifying the Problem

If your default search engine has changed, performing a simple search (e.g., "one plus one") might redirect you to Yahoo or another search engine instead of Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Restoring Google as the Default Search Engine

To restore Google as your default search engine:

1.  **Navigate to Settings**: Click on the three dots located in the top right corner of your Chrome browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Open Settings**: From the dropdown menu, select "Settings" (or "Configuraci√≥n" if your browser is in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This will open a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  **Access Search Engine Settings**: In the settings tab, locate and go to the "Search engine" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This section manages the search engines your browser uses, such as Yahoo or Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
4.  **[[managing_search_engines_in_google_chrome | Manage Search Engines]]**: Click on "Manage Search Engines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Here, you'll see a list of all installed search engines, including your current default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Setting Google as Default

If Google is listed but not the default:
*   Find Google in the list.
*   Next to Google, select the option to "Make default" (this is the implied action from the video's explanation of having Google as default) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Adding Google if it's Missing

If Google is not in the list of installed search engines:
1.  **Add a New Search Engine**: Look for an option to add a new search engine.
2.  **Enter Google's Details**:
    *   **Search engine name**: Type "Google" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   **Shortcut**: Type "Google.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   **Important Note**: Use ".com" for the domain (e.g., google.com) rather than country-specific domains like ".es" or ".uk", as country-specific domains might cause issues if you are not in that particular country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
3.  **Save**: Click "Save" after entering the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

This process ensures that Google is set as your default search engine within Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Outlook allows users to [[configuring_signatures_for_different_email_accounts_in_outlook | configure different signatures]] for new messages versus replies and forwarded emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This provides flexibility in how your outgoing communications are branded or identify you.

## Accessing Signature Settings

To begin, open Outlook and navigate to the options menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. From there, select "Mail" and then "Signatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This section, labeled "Signatures" or "Signatures and Stationery," is where you can [[creating_a_new_signature_with_images_and_text_in_outlook | create or modify signatures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Configuring Signatures for Replies and Forwards

Within the signature settings window:
1.  **Select Email Account**: Choose the specific email account for which you want to configure the signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Outlook supports multiple email accounts, and each can have its own signature settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Choose Signature for New Messages**: For "New messages," select the signature you wish to use for original emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
3.  **Choose Signature for Replies/Forwards**: For "Replies/forwards," you can select a different signature, or choose "don't use" if you prefer no signature on replies or forwarded messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This setting determines which signature is used when replying to or forwarding an email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
4.  **Apply Settings**: After selecting your desired options, click "OK" to save the configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Demonstration

Once configured, when you reply to an email, your chosen signature for replies will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This allows for a consistent and professional appearance across all your email communications.

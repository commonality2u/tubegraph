Google Chrome allows users to manage pop-up windows by blocking them from specific websites, even if pop-ups are generally enabled for other sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This provides a granular level of control over your browsing experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## How to Block Specific Sites

To block pop-up windows from a particular website:
1.  Open the Google Chrome browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Configuration" (Settings) section, located at the top right of the browser window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.
3.  Click on "[[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | advanced settings]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
4.  In the [[google_chrome_privacy_and_security_settings | privacy and security]] section (found on the left sidebar), click on "site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, you can use the "Search settings" bar and type "emerging" to quickly find the "site configuration" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.
5.  Scroll down to find the "windows emerging redirects" (Pop-ups and redirects) option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
    *   This option typically states that it does not allow sites to send pop-up windows or use redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. If you wish to allow pop-ups generally, you would enable this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
6.  Within this setting, you will find options to block specific sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
7.  Click "Add" and enter the full URL of the website you wish to block, for example, `www.youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
8.  Once added, that specific site will no longer send pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>.

### Control Options for Pop-ups
Google Chrome offers flexible control over pop-up windows, allowing you to:
*   Activate pop-up windows for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   [[blocking_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | Disable pop-up windows]] for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
*   Have pop-up windows activated only for some pages while blocking others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

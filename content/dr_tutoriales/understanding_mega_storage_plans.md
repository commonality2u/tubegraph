Mega is a web service primarily used for sharing and downloading content, such as series, movies, or documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. After [[how_to_create_a_mega_account | creating a Mega account]] and confirming it via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, users are presented with various storage plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Free Account
The default plan upon [[how_to_create_a_mega_account | account creation]] is the free plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This option provides up to 50 gigabytes of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While this may seem limited, it is considered sufficient for storing small or relatively small files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

To optimize the use of the 50 GB free storage, users can [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compress files]] before [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. For example, a file originally weighing 2.21 gigabytes could be reduced to 13.1 gigabytes after compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, saving approximately 8 to 9 gigabytes of space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Paid Accounts
Mega also offers paid plans for users who require more storage than the free tier provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. These include options like "Lite account" and "Pro" accounts, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The choice of a paid plan depends on the individual user's consumption needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

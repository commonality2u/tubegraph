This article demonstrates how to automatically organize emails in Gmail by [[using_filters_to_manage_emails_in_gmail | creating filters]] to direct specific emails to designated folders or labels, bypassing the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This process helps to [[prioritizing_emails_in_gmail | prioritize emails]] and keep the main inbox clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, it is helpful to have [[creating_folders_in_gmail | existing folders]] (also known as [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | labels]] in Gmail) to categorize your emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Guide

1.  **Access Gmail**:
    *   Open your preferred web browser, such as Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
    *   Navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

2.  **Identify Folders/Labels**:
    *   Review your existing folders or labels. The demonstrator has four folders: YouTube, Social Networks, Google, and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   The objective is to automatically classify all emails from a specific sender (e.g., YouTube account notifications) directly into a chosen folder (e.g., the YouTube folder), without them appearing in the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. These emails will enter the folder as unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

3.  **Select an Email for Filtering**:
    *   Locate an email from the sender you wish to filter. For this example, an automatic mailbox notification from "noreply@youtube.com" is used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   Click the three dots located on the right side of the email to open more options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

4.  **Initiate Filter Creation**:
    *   From the options, select "Filter messages like these" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   A dialog box will appear, pre-filling the "From" field with the sender's email address (e.g., "noreply@youtube.com") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

5.  **Configure Filter Actions**:
    *   **Skip the Inbox (Archive it)**: Check this option to ensure emails from this sender do not appear in your primary inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   **Apply the label**: Select the desired label/folder from the dropdown menu (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Also apply filter to matching conversations**: Check this box to apply the newly created filter to all existing emails from that sender that are already in your mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   Click "Create filter" to finalize the setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Verification

After [[creating_labels_in_gmail | creating the filter]], all current and future emails from the specified sender will be automatically grouped into the designated folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. These emails will appear as unread within that folder, bypassing the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

For example, when a new comment is posted on YouTube, the notification email will go directly into the YouTube folder, increasing the count of unread emails in that folder, instead of appearing in the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

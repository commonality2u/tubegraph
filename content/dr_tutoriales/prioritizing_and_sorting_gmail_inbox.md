## How to Automatically Organize Emails Using Filters

The primary method for [[using_filters_in_gmail_to_manage_emails | filtering and organizing emails]] automatically is by creating filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This allows emails from specific senders to be sorted directly into designated folders without appearing in your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.

### Steps to Create a Filter

1.  **Access Gmail:** Open your preferred browser (e.g., Google Chrome) and navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Identify Folders/Labels:** Confirm the folders or [[organizing_emails_with_labels | labels]] you wish to use for organizing your emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>. For example, you might have folders for YouTube notifications, social networks, Google, or Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.
3.  **Select an Email for Filtering:** Choose an email from the sender you want to filter (e.g., a notification from `noreply@youtube.com`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
4.  **Filter Similar Messages:** With the email selected, click the three-dots icon (More options) and choose "Filter similar messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. This will populate the "From" field with the sender's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
5.  **Create New Filter:** Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
6.  **Configure Filter Actions:** In the filter creation window, select the following options:
    *   **Skip the Inbox (Archive it):** This is crucial to ensure emails do not appear in your primary inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Apply the label:** Choose the specific folder/label where you want these emails to be moved (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Also apply filter to matching conversations:** Check this box to move all existing emails from that sender into the designated folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.
7.  **Finalize Filter:** Click "Create filter" again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

Once the filter is created, all emails from the specified sender, including those already received, will automatically move to the chosen folder/label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. They will appear as unread within that folder, allowing you to review them at your convenience based on your priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This method is effective for [[filtering_emails_from_specific_accounts | filtering emails from specific accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

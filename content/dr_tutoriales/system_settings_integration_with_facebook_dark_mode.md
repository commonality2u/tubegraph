The Facebook application allows users to set their dark mode preference to integrate directly with their mobile device's system settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:43">[01:33:43]</a>. This means Facebook will automatically adjust its display based on the phone's overall theme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>.

## Accessing Dark Mode Settings

To configure dark mode for the Facebook app:
1.  Ensure the Facebook application is downloaded and updated to the latest version. This applies to both [[setting_facebook_to_dark_mode_for_android | Android]] and [[setting_facebook_to_dark_mode_for_iphone | iPhone]] devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>.
2.  Open the Facebook app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:23">[01:13:23]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the three lines representing the menu, typically found on the bottom right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
4.  Within the "Configuration and privacy" section, locate and select the "Dark mode" option, identifiable by a moon icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:13">[01:19:13]</a>.

## "System" Option Explained

Upon entering the dark mode settings, three options are presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:03">[01:31:03]</a>:
*   **System**: This is the default selected option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>. When "System" is chosen, Facebook's appearance will mirror the mobile phone's system-wide display settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:23">[01:36:23]</a>. For example, if the phone is set to dark mode, Facebook will also switch to dark mode. Conversely, if the phone is in a bright or white mode, Facebook will revert from dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:93">[01:41:93]</a>. Many users prefer this setting for a consistent visual experience across all applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:23">[02:13:23]</a>.

## Overriding System Settings

Users also have the flexibility to override the system's dark mode preference for Facebook specifically:
*   **Deactivate**: This option forces Facebook to display in white mode, even if the mobile device's system is set to dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:63">[01:52:63]</a>.
*   **Activate**: This option enables dark mode within Facebook, regardless of whether the mobile device's system is set to a bright theme or has dark mode disabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:73">[01:59:73]</a>. This allows users to view Facebook in dark mode independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:33">[02:07:33]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Dark Mode Shade
> Facebook's dark mode is not a pure black, but rather a darker shade of gray, slightly lighter than a true black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:13">[02:20:13]</a>.

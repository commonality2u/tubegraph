This tutorial demonstrates how to automatically organize incoming emails in Gmail by directing them to specific folders, bypassing the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method helps in [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | prioritizing and sorting your inbox]] based on your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before setting up automatic organization, ensure you have [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | existing folders]] in your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. If you need to [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | create folders]], a separate tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Steps to Automatically Organize Emails

The process involves creating filters to direct specific emails to designated folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

1.  **Access Gmail**: Open your preferred web browser, such as Google Chrome, and navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Identify Target Folder**: Determine which existing folder you want specific emails to go into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. For example, if you have a "YouTube" folder, you might want all YouTube-related emails to go there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
3.  **Select an Email for Filtering**: Choose an email from the sender you wish to filter. For instance, an automatic notification email from `noreply@youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Filter Creation**:
    *   With the email selected, click on the three-dot menu icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
    *   Select the option "Filter messages like these" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This will populate the filter criteria based on the sender's email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
5.  **Configure the Filter**:
    *   Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Skip the Inbox**: Check the option "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This ensures emails go directly to the folder without appearing in your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Apply Label/Folder**: Check "Apply the label" and select the desired folder from the dropdown menu (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Emails will enter this folder as unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Apply to Existing Conversations**: To organize past emails, check "Also apply filter to X matching conversations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. This moves all previous emails from that sender to the selected folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
6.  **Create Filter**: Click "Create filter" to save your settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Verification

Once the filter is created, all past emails from the specified sender will immediately move to the designated folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. Future emails from the same sender will also automatically be routed to that folder, bypassing the inbox entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

For example, a test comment posted on a YouTube video from a secondary Google account will trigger an email notification that is automatically directed to the "YouTube" folder instead of the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. You can confirm this by checking the folder, where the count of emails will increase, and the new email will appear directly within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

## Benefits

This method allows you to [[filtering_and_managing_emails_in_gmail | organize your email automatically]] and efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. It helps in [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | managing your inbox]] by ensuring specific types of emails are grouped together, making them easier to review at your convenience without cluttering your main incoming messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

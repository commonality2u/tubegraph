This guide explains how to automatically organize emails in Gmail by setting up filters to sort incoming messages directly into specific folders (also known as labels). This process helps you [[prioritizing_emails_in_gmail | prioritize]] and manage your inbox efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have already created the necessary [[creating_folders_in_gmail | email folders]] in Gmail where you want your messages to be organized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. If you need help with [[creating_folders_in_gmail | creating folders]], another tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

The goal is to automatically classify emails from specific senders into designated folders, bypassing the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This way, they will be grouped and available for reading when desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The filtered emails will appear as unread within their respective folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Steps to Create an Automatic Email Filter

To begin [[using_filters_to_manage_emails_in_gmail | creating filters]] to automatically organize your emails:

1.  **Access Gmail**: Open your preferred browser, such as Google Chrome, and navigate to your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  **Identify Folders**: Review the folders you have already created. For example, folders might be set up for "YouTube," "Social Networks," "Google," and "Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  **Select an Email for Filtering**: Choose an email from the sender you wish to filter. For instance, to filter YouTube notifications, select an email from "no-reply@youtube.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Filter Creation**: With the email selected, click on the three dots (more options) menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
5.  **Filter Similar Messages**: From the dropdown menu, select "Filter similar messages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This action will open a new window to set up the filter rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
6.  **Create Filter**: In the filter creation window, click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
7.  **Configure Filter Actions**:
    *   **Skip the Inbox**: Mark the option "Skip the Inbox (Archive it)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This ensures emails go directly to the designated folder without appearing in your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   **Apply Label (Folder)**: Select "Apply the label:" and choose the specific folder you want these emails to go into, for example, the "YouTube" folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Apply to Existing Conversations**: Check "Also apply filter to X matching conversations" to apply the filter to all existing emails from that sender that meet the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
8.  **Finalize Filter**: Click "Create filter" to save your settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Once the filter is created, all emails from the specified sender (e.g., no-reply@youtube.com) will automatically move into the chosen folder, appearing as unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Demonstration and Verification

To verify the filter's functionality, you can send a test email or trigger a notification from the filtered source. For instance, commenting on a YouTube video will generate a notification from "no-reply@youtube.com" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

*   After the filter is active, such a notification will not appear in your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   Instead, when you check the designated folder (e.g., "YouTube"), the email count will increase, and the new message will be located there, unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

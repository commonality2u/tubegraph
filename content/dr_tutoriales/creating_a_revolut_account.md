## Sign-up and Referral Bonus

Users can create a new account within Revolut by using a specific link provided in the first comment of the video tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

### Conditions for Receiving the Bonus

To receive the ten-euro bonus, new users must:
*   Order a physical [[revolut_card_features | Revolut card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   Make a purchase using the ordered Revolut card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This process is described as very easy and simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

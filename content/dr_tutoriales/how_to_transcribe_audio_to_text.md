Transcribing audio to text can be achieved easily online, particularly using [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This process involves using various online tools that convert spoken words into written text.

## Choosing Transcription Tools

There are both [[free_and_paid_transcription_tools | free and paid transcription tools]] available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. For initial or simple tasks, two completely free tools are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. However, for more extensive or professional transcription needs, users will often encounter paid services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Many transcription services require significant computational power, which is why they often charge for their services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Examples of Paid Tools:
*   **Happy Scribe**: Offers a free starting point, but pricing is based on minutes or word count for continued use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Speech Text Artificial Intelligence**: Charges around ten dollars per month for 180 minutes of transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
*   **Open AI**: Requires payment for its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Bizz**: Also has limitations, such as free subtitles only for the first thirty minutes, with payment required thereafter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

> [!info] Quality Difference
> Paid platforms generally offer a much higher quality of transcription compared to free tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Free tools are suitable for basic needs but cannot handle large volumes like entire movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Transcription Process (Using Free Online Tools)

The process typically involves using a web-based "voice to text and transcription online" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

1.  **Import Audio**: Directly import the audio file (e.g., a WhatsApp audio recording downloaded to your computer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  **Select Document**: Choose the audio document to be transcribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Set Speed**: Adjust the transcription speed to "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Setting it too fast can lead to incorrect transcriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
4.  **Transcribe**: Click "transcribe audio or video" and then "play" to start the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The audio will play, and the transcription will appear on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Example Transcription and [[accuracy_and_reliability_of_audio_transcription_tools | Accuracy]]:

An example audio containing phrases like "Subscribe. Give it a superlike. Support Real Madrid. Hala Madrid. Long live Spain and Mother who gave birth to you. Testing, testing, I hope it works" was transcribed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

The tool provided a "reliable" version of the audio, generally achieving 80-90% successful word transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. In the example, it made a mistake with "Mother who gave birth to you," transcribing it incorrectly perhaps due to the speed of speech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

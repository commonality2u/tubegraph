Google Forms provides various ways to view and analyze survey or quiz responses, both within the form interface and by exporting them to other formats like Google Sheets or CSV. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>

## Accessing Responses

Once a form has received submissions, the number of responses will appear in the "Responses" tab. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a> To view them, navigate to the "Responses" section within your form. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>

## Response Management Options

Within the "Responses" section, clicking on the three-dot menu provides several options for managing responses:
*   **Email Notifications**: Receive an email every time someone responds to the form. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>
*   **Select Response Destination**: Choose where the responses will be sent. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>
*   **Unlink Form**: Disconnect the form from its response destination. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **[[exporting_google_forms_responses_to_csv_or_excel | Download Responses]]**: Download responses in CSV format. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
*   **Open in Google Sheets**: Directly open the responses in a Google Sheet. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>

## Viewing Responses within Google Forms

Google Forms offers three primary ways to view responses directly within the interface:

### 1. Summary View
This is the default view and provides an overview of all responses, aggregated globally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a> It's useful for seeing collective data, such as responses to multiple-choice questions, satisfaction levels, and other aggregated insights. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> The speaker personally prefers this view for a comprehensive overview of all responses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>

### 2. Question View
By clicking on the "Question" tab, you can view responses for one question at a time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> For example, you can see everyone who responded to a specific question. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> This provides a different way of visualizing the data compared to the summary. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>

### 3. Individual View
The "Individual" tab allows you to view each person's complete set of answers separately. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> You can scroll through individual submissions (e.g., from Jesus, John, Antonio) to see all the questions they answered. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a> This view is useful for reviewing a single respondent's entire submission, including their name, email, and specific answers to all questions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

## Exporting Responses to Spreadsheets

While Google Forms offers an online interface for visualization, responses can also be exported for more detailed analysis:

### Exporting to CSV
You can [[exporting_google_forms_responses_to_csv_or_excel | download responses in CSV format]], which can then be opened in spreadsheet programs like Excel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

### Opening in Google Sheets
A common and intuitive way to manage responses is by linking the form to a Google Sheet. To do this, click "View in Sheets" from the responses section. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>

In Google Sheets, responses are typically grouped by:
*   **Timestamp**: Showing the exact date, hour, and minute of submission. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
*   **Individual Responses**: Each row represents a respondent's complete set of answers, including email, tutorial topic, satisfaction, questions, platform used, and subscription status. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>

Linking Google Forms data to Excel is also possible, with a tutorial available on the topic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

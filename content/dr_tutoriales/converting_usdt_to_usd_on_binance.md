This tutorial outlines two methods for converting USDT (Tether) into USD (fiat currency), specifically addressing how to perform this operation on Binance and via an alternative platform, Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Binance Account Discount

Before proceeding, new users can create a Binance account using a recommended link to receive a 10% discount on commissions for operations, transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This discount can lead to significant savings over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Method 1: Converting USDT to USD via Binance P2P

Direct exchange of USDT to USD is not found in the standard markets and trading sections of Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Therefore, the Peer-to-Peer (P2P) method is utilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Understanding P2P Trading

P2P, or person-to-person, is an exchange system for cryptocurrencies through various payment systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. On Binance P2P, you can [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | exchange USDT with USD]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Steps to Sell USDT for USD on Binance P2P

1.  **Navigate to P2P Trading**: From the Binance interface, go to "Trading" and select "P2P" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Select "Sell"**: Instead of buying, you will be selling USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  **Choose Cryptocurrency and Fiat Currency**: Select USDT as the cryptocurrency you wish to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Then, filter the fiat currency to USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. You can choose from various fiat currencies like Japanese Yuan or Chinese Yuan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
4.  **Review Advertisers**:
    *   **Price**: Observe the USDT price offered by advertisers. While USDT typically has a 1:1 relationship with USD, some advertisers might charge a small fee per transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
    *   **Payment Method**: You can filter by desired payment methods, including PayPal, bank transfer, and others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Advertiser History**: It is highly recommended to trade with users who have a high percentage of completed orders (e.g., above 95%) and a significant number of past orders. This indicates reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   **Limits and Availability**: Check the advertiser's transaction limits (minimum/maximum dollar amount) and their available USDT balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  **Initiate Sale**:
    *   Click "Sell USDT" for the chosen advertiser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount of USDT you wish to sell. The system will display the corresponding USD amount you will receive, including any commissions charged by the advertiser (e.g., PayPal shipping commission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
    *   Ensure your payment method is attached to your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. You can add or verify payment methods in your account settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   Review and confirm the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

This method allows you to [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | convert your USDT to USD]] directly through Binance's P2P platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

## Method 2: Converting USDT to USD via Kraken

There is also a tutorial available on how Kraken works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a> and a discount link for creating a Kraken account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

    *   Note the minimum deposit amount (e.g., 1 USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Generate a new deposit address or QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Copy this address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   **Important**: Kraken is not responsible for funds sent to incorrect addresses. Always double-check the address to avoid losing your capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

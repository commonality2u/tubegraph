This tutorial explains how to convert USDT (Tether) into fiat currency (USD) on Binance, offering two primary methods to achieve this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Method 1: Using Binance P2P Trading

The P2P (Peer-to-Person) trading section on Binance allows for the [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | exchange of cryptocurrencies]] through various systems directly between users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

### Why P2P is Necessary for USDT to USD Conversion
Direct exchange of USDT to USD is typically not found in the advanced trading markets on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. For example, searching for USDT/USD in the trading section will not yield results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Steps to Convert USDT to USD via P2P
1.  **Navigate to P2P Trading**: From the Binance interface, go to the "trading" section and select "p2p" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Select 'Sell' and Currency**: Choose the "Sell" option for USDT. Then, select "USD" as the fiat currency you wish to receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. You can also select other cryptocurrencies like BTC, BUSD, or BNB if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
3.  **Filter and Review Offers**:
    *   You will see available offers from advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   Note that some advertisers might offer slightly more than the 1:1 ratio for USDT to USD, implying a small fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   **Payment Method**: You can filter offers by desired payment method, including bank transfer, PayPal, or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.
    *   **Advertiser History**: Review the advertiser's history, including the number of orders placed and their completion percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. A high completion percentage (e.g., above 95%) indicates reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   **Limits and Availability**: Check the transaction limits (minimum/maximum dollars accepted) and the amount of USDT the advertiser has available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Sale**:
    *   Once you've chosen an advertiser, click "Sell USDT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   Specify the amount of USDT you want to sell. The system will show how much USD you will receive after commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Ensure your payment method is attached to your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. You can add or verify payment methods in your profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Method 2: Using the Kraken Platform

If the Binance P2P method does not suit your needs, or if you prefer a direct exchange not offered by Binance's advanced trading, the Kraken platform provides a direct exchange for USDT to USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Why Use Kraken?
Kraken offers a direct USDT to USD pairing, which Binance's standard trading platform doesn't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Using Kraken Pro is recommended for potentially lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Steps to Convert USDT to USD on Kraken
1.  **Access Kraken Pro**: Navigate to Kraken Pro (or the standard Kraken platform) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
2.  **Search for USDT/USD Pair**: In the exchange section, search for "USDT" and locate the USDT/USD pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
3.  **Place a Sell Order**:
    *   Select "Sell" and choose a "Market Order" for real-time execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount of USDT you wish to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Review the total price and confirm the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

### Transferring USDT from Binance to Kraken
To use Kraken, you'll first need to transfer your USDT from Binance to your Kraken account.

1.  **Generate USDT Deposit Address on Kraken**:
    *   On Kraken, go to the "Funds" section and click "show all assets" to display all cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   Search for "USDT" (it's usually listed under 'U' in alphabetical order) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   Select the "Deposit" option for USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
    *   Choose the deposit method (blockchain network), typically ERC-20 (Ethereum network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Review the minimum deposit amount (e.g., 1 USDT) and acknowledge that Kraken is not responsible for funds sent to an incorrect address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
    *   Generate a new deposit address and copy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. A QR code option is also available if you're using a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

2.  **Withdraw USDT from Binance**:
    *   On Binance, go to your "Spot Wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   Click "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   Select "USDT" as the coin to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   Paste the copied Kraken USDT deposit address into the "New Address" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   Select the correct network, which should match the one chosen on Kraken (e.g., ERC-20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Be aware of network fees (e.g., 10 USDT for ERC-20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount to withdraw. Note that fees are fixed, so withdrawing larger amounts makes the transaction more profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For example, withdrawing 20 USDT with a 10 USDT fee means half your amount is lost to fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   **Recommendation**: For large transfers, it's advised to first send a small test amount to ensure the process works correctly before sending the full amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This prevents loss of funds due to incorrect addresses, as mistaken transfers are unrecoverable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Important Considerations
*   When creating a Binance account, consider using a recommended link to get a 10% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, and deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   Similarly, if you decide to use Kraken, a recommended link for account creation might offer similar commission discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   Explore Binance's investment products to generate interest on your cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

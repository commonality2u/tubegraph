Utilizing an Amazon affiliate account enables users to [[generating_revenue_through_amazon_affiliate_program | generate revenue]] by promoting Amazon products and earning a [[generating_commissions_from_amazon_affiliates | commission]] on sales [00:00:08]. This process involves [[creating_amazon_affiliate_links | creating Amazon affiliate links]] that direct potential customers to Amazon products.

## Prerequisites
Before you can start [[creating_amazon_affiliate_links | creating Amazon affiliate links]], you must have an [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | Amazon Affiliates account]] [00:00:59]. [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | Creating an Amazon Affiliates account]] is described as a quick and simple process, taking approximately five minutes [00:01:08].

A specific "app code" (likely referring to the Amazon API) allows for the promotion of Amazon products after making three sales [00:00:23]. For those who haven't met this sales threshold, a WordPress plugin can be used to advertise Amazon products without needing this code [00:00:19], [00:00:33].

## [[methods_for_obtaining_amazon_affiliate_links | Methods for Obtaining Amazon Affiliate Links]]

There are two primary [[methods_for_obtaining_amazon_affiliate_links | methods for obtaining Amazon affiliate links]].

### Method 1: From the Amazon Affiliates Platform
This method involves [[navigating_the_amazon_affiliates_platform | navigating the Amazon Affiliates platform]] itself.

1.  **Access the Platform**: Log in to your Amazon Affiliates account [00:00:59].
2.  **Navigate to Product Links**: On the Amazon Affiliates screen, locate the "Product Links" tab [00:01:18]. Select the "Product Links" option [00:01:25].
3.  **Search for Products**: Use the search engine provided to find any product available on Amazon [00:01:28], [00:01:31]. For example, searching "Call of Duty Playstation 4" will display relevant results [00:01:36], [00:01:40]. The platform will indicate the number of search results found [00:01:48].
4.  **Obtain the Link**:
    *   **Long Link**: For any desired product, click on the arrow next to it to reveal a long, detailed link [00:02:00], [00:02:04]. This link can be copied and pasted for others to use for purchases [00:02:07].
    *   **Shortened Link**: If a shorter, more visual link is preferred, click the arrow again and select the option to shorten the URL [00:02:26], [00:02:32]. A shortened Amazon affiliate link will appear, which can then be copied and used [00:02:37].

Links obtained through this method can be integrated into your website, potentially with the aid of a WordPress plugin mentioned earlier [00:02:41].

### Method 2: From the Official Amazon Page (Amazon Web Bar Affiliates)
This method is described as intuitive and useful, allowing affiliates to generate links directly while browsing Amazon.

1.  **Access Official Amazon Page**: Go to the main Amazon website where products are displayed [00:02:58], [00:03:00].
2.  **Utilize the Web Bar**: Once on the Amazon product page, a "Amazon Web Bar Affiliates" taskbar will appear at the top [00:03:05], [00:03:08]. This utility is exclusively available to accounts registered with Amazon Affiliates [00:03:15].
3.  **Generate Link for Any Product**: When viewing any product on Amazon, the web bar offers the option to get the affiliate link for that specific product [00:03:20], [00:03:44].
    *   **Text Format**: Clicking on "Text format" provides options to choose the affiliate ID or [[using_keywords_and_tracking_ids_for_amazon_affiliate_marketing | tracking ID]] for monitoring [00:03:49], [00:04:00]. Users can select either a short link or a full link [00:04:18].
    *   **Text + Image Format**: Selecting "Text + image" generates a different type of link that, when clicked, opens the product page in a new tab [00:04:28], [00:04:32]. This feature helps retain visitors on your original website [00:04:38].

Simply copy the generated link and embed it on your website or other promotional pages [00:04:45].

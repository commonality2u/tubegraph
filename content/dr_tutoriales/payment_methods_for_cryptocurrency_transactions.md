This guide explains how to deposit both fiat money and cryptocurrencies into the KuCoin platform, and how to use these funds to purchase other crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It also covers the associated commissions and the platform's account structure.

## Depositing Fiat Money

To deposit fiat money (such as Euros, US Dollars, or British Pounds) into KuCoin:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section from the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Select "Credit/Debit Card" which also presents other [[fiat_and_cryptocurrency_deposit_methods | payment methods]] like Apple Pay and SEPA transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired fiat currency (e.g., EUR, USD, GBP) to see the available deposit methods specific to that currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to deposit. There are minimum and maximum amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
5.  Convert the fiat amount to a stablecoin like USDT (Tether). This is recommended for stable conversion between fiat and crypto assets, as USDT is designed to maintain a stable value over time, unlike volatile cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Understanding Commissions and Intermediaries
When depositing fiat money, the platform displays the commission charged for each method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For example, depositing 120 Euros might result in different USDT amounts depending on whether you use Visa/Mastercard via the Advcash payment channel or SEPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Advcash acts as an intermediary between your fiat money and the crypto asset (USDT) on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The commissions you pay are generally to Advcash for facilitating this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. It's important to analyze the [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | payment methods]] associated with each currency to find the most cost-effective option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

Deposits made via card transfer are typically processed within a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, while bank transfers (like SEPA) may take business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Depositing Cryptocurrencies

To transfer cryptocurrencies to your KuCoin account from another platform (e.g., Binance):
1.  Go to the "Assets" section and click "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
2.  Select the specific [[cryptocurrency_selection_for_withdrawal | cryptocurrency]] you wish to deposit, such as Bitcoin (BTC) or Litecoin (LTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
3.  KuCoin will provide a unique deposit address for that cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
4.  On your external platform (e.g., Binance), navigate to your wallet and select the "Withdraw" option for the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
5.  Enter the KuCoin deposit address you copied into the withdrawal field on the external platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The network will usually be automatically detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
6.  Confirm the transaction, noting any minimum withdrawal amounts or network commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## KuCoin Account Structure

KuCoin utilizes different account types for managing funds:
*   **Main Account:** Used for depositing and withdrawing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Trading Account:** Where cryptocurrencies must be held to perform trading activities (buying and selling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Margin and Futures Accounts:** Used for more advanced trading strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

Before purchasing cryptocurrencies, any funds deposited into your Main Account (whether fiat-converted USDT or deposited crypto) must be transferred to your Trading Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Buying Cryptocurrencies on KuCoin

Once funds are in your Trading Account, you can buy cryptocurrencies:
1.  Go to the "Markets" section on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
2.  Select the desired trading pair (e.g., KCS/USDT if you deposited USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. KuCoin offers a wide variety of cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
3.  Access the interactive trading menu and input your trading password for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
4.  Ensure "Spot" trading is selected (not Margin or Futures) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
5.  Choose an order type:
    *   **Market Order:** Buys at the current market price instantly. You only specify the quantity you want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
    *   **Limit Order:** Allows you to set a specific price at which your buy or sell order will execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.
    *   Other order types include Stop Limit and Stop orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
6.  Enter the quantity of the cryptocurrency you wish to buy or use the percentage slider to allocate a portion of your USDT balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
7.  Confirm the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

### Trading Commissions
KuCoin's standard trading commissions are generally 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. These commissions can decrease based on the volume of cryptocurrencies you hold on the exchange, particularly if you hold KuCoin Shares (KCS). Higher trading volume leads to lower fees, encouraging users to keep more crypto on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Holding KCS can also provide discounts on trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

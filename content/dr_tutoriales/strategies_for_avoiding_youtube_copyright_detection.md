YouTube frequently bans videos due to copyright infringements, which can be triggered by both audio (music, voices) and images present in the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can lead to videos being blocked from public viewing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. While some videos may still be monetized, they can eventually face blocking or outright banning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. The aim is to upload fragments of series, chapters, films, or [[uploading_anime_clips_to_youtube_without_copyright_issues | anime]] without encountering these prohibitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Recommended Tool

The video demonstrates using Filmora 9 as a [[video_editing_techniques_to_avoid_copyright_bans_on_youtube | video editing]] program for implementing these [[effects_and_modifications_to_bypass_copyright_tracking | strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Video Editing Strategies

The core idea behind these [[video_editing_techniques_to_avoid_copyright_bans_on_youtube | video editing techniques]] is to modify both the visual and audio elements sufficiently so that YouTube's copyright detection system cannot track the original content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Visual Modifications

Applying consistent visual changes throughout the entire video is crucial:
*   **Channel Logo Inclusion**
    *   Place your channel's logo on the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Ensure the logo remains visible throughout the entire duration of the video, from start to finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This helps "retouch" the video's image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Adding Effects**
    *   Incorporate various [[effects_and_modifications_to_bypass_copyright_tracking | effects]], such as a "light leak," which are available within editing software like Filmora <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Implementing Borders**
    *   Add a border around the video frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   Borders can be customized (e.g., blue at the bottom, white at the top, creating a blurred effect), and their size and color are editable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Purpose of Visual Changes:** These [[effects_and_modifications_to_bypass_copyright_tracking | visual modifications]] (full-screen video with a border and logo) aim to prevent YouTube from tracking the copyright through the video's images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Audio Modifications

Modifying the audio track is as important as visual changes:
*   **Volume Adjustment**
    *   When importing a video into Filmora 9, it comes with a default sound volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   Slightly turn down the volume of the original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This minor adjustment prevents YouTube from detecting original audio peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Users can then adjust their volume on YouTube if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Purpose of Audio Changes:** By modifying the video's audio, YouTube's copyright detection system will struggle to recognize the original sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Uploading and [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | Visibility Considerations]]

After applying both image and audio modifications, the video can be exported and uploaded to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. If these steps are followed correctly, the video should successfully process and be available for public [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | visibility]] without restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

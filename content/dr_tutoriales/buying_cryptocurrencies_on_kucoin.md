It covers depositing both fiat money and crypto assets, as well as executing trades.

## Depositing Capital on KuCoin

To begin [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | cryptocurrencies]], you first need to deposit funds into your KuCoin account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. The platform supports both fiat money and existing crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

### Depositing Fiat Money

Fiat money refers to traditional currencies like euros, US dollars (USD), or pound sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Buy Crypto**: From the main menu, select "Buy Crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Choose Payment Method**: Click on "Credit/Debit Card". This section also reveals other payment options such as Apple Pay and SEPA transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.
3.  **Select Currency**: Choose the fiat currency you intend to deposit (e.g., EUR for euros, USD for dollars, GP for pound sterling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Available payment methods will adjust based on the selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
4.  **Enter Amount and Convert**: Input the amount you wish to deposit. It's recommended to convert your fiat money into a stablecoin like USDT (Tether) for a stable conversion, rather than directly to a volatile cryptocurrency like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
5.  **Review Commissions**: The platform will show the commission fees for different payment methods. These fees are typically charged by the payment channel (e.g., Pance, acting as an intermediary between fiat money and crypto assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It's important to understand that KuCoin does not directly hold fiat money; it converts it into a crypto asset (like USDT) upon deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
6.  **Complete Transfer**: Follow the on-screen instructions to complete the transfer, which may involve filling in personal and card details on an external page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Card transfers are typically processed within minutes, while other methods like bank transfers may take business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

### Depositing Cryptocurrencies

You can also transfer cryptocurrencies from other platforms (e.g., [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]], Coinbase) to KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

1.  **Go to Assets**: From your KuCoin dashboard, navigate to the "Assets" section, then "Main Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Select Deposit**: Click on "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
3.  **Choose Cryptocurrency**: Select the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
4.  **Copy Deposit Address**: KuCoin will provide a unique deposit address for the chosen cryptocurrency. Copy this address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
5.  **Withdraw from External Platform**: Go to your external crypto platform (e.g., [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]]), select the cryptocurrency you want to withdraw, and paste the KuCoin deposit address into the withdrawal field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>. The platform will automatically detect the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

## Buying Cryptocurrencies on KuCoin

Once your capital (fiat or crypto) is deposited, you can proceed to [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buy cryptocurrencies]] within the KuCoin market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. KuCoin offers a wide variety of crypto assets and projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Understanding Trading Commissions

KuCoin's trading commissions are typically 0.1% for both maker and taker orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. These commissions can decrease based on your trading volume and the amount of KCS (KuCoin Shares) or Bitcoin you hold on the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>.

### Steps to Buy Cryptocurrency

1.  **Navigate to Markets**: Go back to the KuCoin platform and select the "Markets" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
2.  **Select Trading Pair**: Since you likely deposited into USDT, go to the "USDT" section to find cryptocurrencies interchangeable with USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to buy (e.g., KCS/USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>.
3.  **Access Trading Interface**: Open the selected trading pair.

4.  **Select Order Type**: Scroll down to the buying section. Ensure "Spot" trading is selected, not "Margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. For a quick purchase at the current price, select a "Market" order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Other [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | types of orders]] like "Limited" and "Stop Limit" allow you to set specific buy/sell prices for future execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
5.  **Transfer Funds to Trading Account**: This is a crucial step. Initially, deposited funds are in your "Main Account". To perform trading, you must transfer them to your "Trading Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

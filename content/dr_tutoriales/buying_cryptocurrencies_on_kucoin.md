This guide provides a comprehensive tutorial on depositing capital and purchasing cryptocurrencies on the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It covers depositing both fiat money and cryptocurrencies, as well as the process of executing a trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Depositing Capital on KuCoin

KuCoin allows users to deposit capital in two primary forms: fiat money and other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

### Depositing Fiat Money

To deposit fiat currency (such as Euros, US Dollars, or British Pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section in the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Select "Credit Card/Debit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Other payment methods like Apple Pay or SEPA transfers may also be available depending on your region and selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. KuCoin will display minimum and maximum amounts, along with available transfer methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
5.  It is recommended to convert fiat currency to a stablecoin like USDT (Tether) for a stable conversion before purchasing other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This avoids price fluctuations associated with direct conversion to volatile assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

**Commissions**:
Commissions are charged by the payment channel (e.g., Pancea/Ivansa), which acts as an intermediary between your fiat money and the crypto asset on KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. For example, depositing 120 Euros via Visa/Mastercard using Pancea might result in approximately 5 USDT in commissions, while a SEPA transfer could be cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Depositing Cryptocurrencies

To transfer cryptocurrencies from another platform (like [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] or Coinbase) to KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>:
1.  Go to the "Assets" section and then "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
2.  Select the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
3.  Ensure you select the "Main Account" as the receiving account on KuCoin, as this is where deposited funds initially land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
4.  KuCoin will provide a unique deposit address for the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
5.  Copy this address and use it as the withdrawal address on the external platform from which you are sending the crypto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
6.  The external platform (e.g., [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]]) will automatically detect the network (e.g., Litecoin network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
7.  Be aware of minimum withdrawal amounts and network commissions on the sending platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Understanding KuCoin Accounts

KuCoin utilizes different account types to manage funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>:
*   **Main Account**: Used for depositing and withdrawing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Trading Account**: Where your cryptocurrencies must be held to perform trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   **Margin and Futures Accounts**: Used for more advanced trading with leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

To buy cryptocurrencies, funds must be transferred from your Main Account to your Trading Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Buying Cryptocurrencies on KuCoin

Once capital is deposited and transferred to the Trading Account, you can proceed with buying cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Trading Commissions

KuCoin's trading commissions are typically 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. These commissions can decrease based on your trading volume and holdings of KuCoin Shares (KCS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Higher trading volume and KCS holdings lead to lower maker and taker fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Executing a Trade

1.  Go to the "Markets" section on the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
2.  Select the cryptocurrency pair you wish to trade (e.g., KCS/USDT if you deposited USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. KuCoin offers a wide variety of crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
3.  Access the interactive trading menu for the selected pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. You may need to enter a verification code for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
4.  Ensure "Spot" trading is selected, not margin trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
5.  Choose your order type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>:
    *   **Market Order**: Buys or sells immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This option disables manual price input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Limit Order**: Allows you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell.
    *   **Stop Limit/Stop Orders**: More advanced order types for strategic trading.
6.  Enter the quantity of the cryptocurrency you wish to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. You can specify a percentage of your available USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
7.  Click "Buy" to place your order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. If successful, you will receive a confirmation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

Your newly purchased cryptocurrencies will appear in your Trading Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

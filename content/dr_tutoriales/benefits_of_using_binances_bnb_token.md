Using Binance's BNB token offers several advantages within the Binance platform, primarily centered around reducing costs and enhancing user benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

## Commission Reductions
BNB can be used to pay for commissions, providing a significant discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. When paying commissions with BNB, users receive a 25% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This means that instead of paying 0.1% in commissions for buying or selling cryptocurrencies, users will pay 0.075% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> To utilize this discount, the option to "pay commissions with BNB" must be activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a>, and a sufficient quantity of BNB must be available in your spot wallet (not in [[flexible_savings_on_binance | locked savings]] or other locked products) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. If this option is active without BNB, commissions will default to 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

## VIP Level Progression
Holding BNB contributes to a user's VIP level on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. As users increase their BNB holdings, they can move up VIP levels (e.g., from VIP zero to VIP one, VIP two, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>. Higher VIP levels lead to lower trading commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. For example, a VIP zero level pays 0.1% commission, while a VIP one pays 0.09% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Binance Visa Card Refunds
The amount of BNB held influences the refund percentage received when using the Binance Visa card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. For instance, holding 10 BNB can result in a 2% refund on payments made with the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

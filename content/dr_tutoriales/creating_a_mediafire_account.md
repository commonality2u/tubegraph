    *   **Basic Account Storage**: The free "Basic" account provides a maximum of 10 gigabytes (GB) of cloud storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   **Expand Storage**: A guide to potentially increase basic storage up to 50 GB may be available in the video description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Post-Creation Interface

*   **Folders**: The interface displays existing folders within your Mediafire platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
*   **Upload Panel**: The most prominent feature is the "Upload" panel, which allows you to [[how_to_upload_files_to_mediafire | upload files]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Folder Management**: You have the option to [[how_to_manage_files_and_folders_on_mediafire | create new folders]] to organize your files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, you can create a folder named "youtube tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Newly created folders will initially contain zero sub-folders and zero files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

### Upload Options

Within a folder, you can initiate an upload by clicking the "Upload" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

*   **Uploading Files**: You can select individual files from your computer (e.g., a PNG image file) to upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Uploading Folders**: Mediafire also allows you to upload entire folders, which is useful for uploading multiple files at once while maintaining their directory structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Uploading Websites**: The option to upload websites is exclusively available for premium users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Basic accounts do not have this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Once files are uploaded, they appear within the selected folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

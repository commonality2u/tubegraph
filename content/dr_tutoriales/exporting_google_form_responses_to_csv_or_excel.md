Google Forms provides several ways to [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | view]] and [[visualizing_and_analyzing_google_form_responses | analyze responses]], including options to export the data for further use in programs like Excel or Google Sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Viewing Responses within Google Forms

When you open a Google Form, you can see the number of responses in the "Responses" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This tab offers different ways to [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | visualize responses]]:

*   **Summary View**: This is the preferred view as it allows you to see all responses summarized, including details like individual emails and answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Question Tab**: In this tab, you can view responses for each question individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Individual View**: This allows you to see all questions answered by each specific person who responded to the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Response Options
Within the "Responses" section, by clicking on the three dots, you can access additional [[google_form_response_options | options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:
*   [[receiving_email_notifications_for_google_form_responses | Receive email notifications]] every time someone responds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   Select where responses will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Unlink the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Exporting Responses

Google Forms provides two primary methods for exporting response data:

1.  **Download Responses in CSV Format**: You can download all responses in a Comma Separated Values (CSV) file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This format can be easily opened by spreadsheet programs like Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
2.  **Open in Google Sheets**: This option links your form responses directly to a Google Sheet spreadsheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. To do this, navigate to the "Responses" tab and click "View in Sheets" at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

When responses are viewed in Google Sheets, they are organized by timestamp, indicating the exact date, hour, and minute each response was submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Subsequent columns display the responses for each question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This integration allows for detailed [[using_google_sheets_with_google_forms | analysis and organization]] of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If you wish to link this data to Excel, a separate video tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

*   [[configuring_signatures_for_different_email_accounts_in_outlook | Configure signatures for specific email accounts]] if you have multiple accounts set up in Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Set default signatures for new messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   [[using_signatures_for_replies_and_forwarded_emails_in_outlook | Configure signatures to be used for replies and forwarded emails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This allows you to choose which signature is used in all respects, for new messages and for replies/forwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Seeing Signatures in Action

Once your signatures are configured and saved:
*   When composing a new email, your default signature will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This signature is defined for each email address you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   When replying to an email, the configured signature for replies will be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

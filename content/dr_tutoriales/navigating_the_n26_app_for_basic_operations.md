This tutorial provides a guide on how to effectively use the N26 mobile application to manage your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The app aims to provide an easier, more efficient, and useful way to optimize banking operations from a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

It is important to note that N26 is characterized as a bank that does not charge commissions for domestic or international transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This can be particularly useful for those who experience issues with traditional banks when making transfers to countries like Great Britain, the UK, or the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. For information on setting up an account, refer to the [[how_to_create_and_manage_an_n26_account | account creation tutorial]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## App Compatibility and Account Types

The N26 app functions identically on both iPhone and Android operating systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

When starting with N26, the basic or "Standard" account is free and does not incur monthly payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Other account types are available with additional features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

The N26 application features two main menus: one at the bottom and one at the top <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Top Menu Options
The top menu provides four options:
*   **Profile**: To view personal account information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

#### Changing Banks
N26 offers an option to facilitate a change of bank, handling the transfer of addresses and payments to your N26 account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. However, the speaker uses N26 primarily for [[the_benefits_of_n26_for_international_transactions | free international transactions]], maintaining their national bank as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

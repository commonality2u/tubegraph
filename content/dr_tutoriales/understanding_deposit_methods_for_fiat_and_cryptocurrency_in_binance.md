By understanding these [[fiat_and_cryptocurrency_deposit_methods | methods]], users can save on fees and have more capital to invest in cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

If you don't have a Binance account, it's recommended to create one using a referral link to get a 10% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, and deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Direct Deposits on Binance

To deposit money into Binance, navigate to your wallet by clicking on your profile, then "Wallet" and "Overview" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. From there, select "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Binance offers two primary deposit options: [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | depositing cryptocurrencies]] or fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### Fiat Currency Deposits

Fiat currencies are national currencies like Euro, Dollar, Pound Sterling, Rubles, or Czech Crowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The available [[fiat_and_cryptocurrency_deposit_methods | deposit methods]] and their associated commissions can vary based on the specific currency chosen and the current market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Examples of methods and their commissions:
*   **Euro (EUR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
    *   Visa/MC bank card: 1.8% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
    *   P2P bank transfer: 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>
    *   Wallet make cash: 0% commission (additional fees may apply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>
*   **Pound Sterling (GBP)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>:
    *   Bank card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>
    *   Quick payments (may be suspended) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>
*   **Dollar (USD)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
    *   SWIFT bank transfer: 0% commission (this option may not always be enabled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

Some methods, like SEPA transfers and rapid payments, may be temporarily suspended for certain countries within the European community due to ongoing analysis of transfers and legality issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While bank card deposits might be available, a commission of 1.8% is considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Deposits

To deposit cryptocurrencies, select the "Deposit Crypto" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. You can search for any accepted cryptocurrency, such as Tron (TRX) or Litecoin (LTC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. Cryptocurrency deposits also incur a price, which depends on the blockchain network used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. It is important to choose cryptocurrencies whose sending costs are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Alternative Strategies for Low-Commission Deposits

If direct fiat [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | deposits on Binance]] have high commissions, an [[alternatives_for_depositing_money_into_binance_with_low_commissions | alternative method]] is to deposit fiat into another cryptocurrency exchange or platform with lower or zero fiat deposit fees, convert the fiat to a low-cost cryptocurrency on that platform, and then transfer the cryptocurrency to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This strategy aims to minimize the overall cost of getting funds into Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Using Kraken as an intermediary

Kraken is an example of a platform where you can deposit fiat currency with potentially lower fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
1.  **Deposit Fiat**: For instance, you can deposit Euros into Kraken using SEPA transfer, which might have 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This transfer typically takes one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
2.  **Convert to Cryptocurrency**: Once the fiat is in Kraken, convert it into a cryptocurrency that has low transfer fees.
    *   Converting Euros to a cryptocurrency might cost around 0.16% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. For example, converting 2,000 Euros to Bitcoin could cost 3.2 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   **Recommended low-cost cryptocurrencies for transfer**: Litecoin (LTC) and Tron (TRX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
        *   Litecoin (LTC) withdrawal cost on Kraken: 0.02 LTC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
        *   Tron (TRX) withdrawal cost on Kraken: 2 TRX, which is approximately 10 cents USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
3.  **Transfer Crypto to Binance**: Send the converted cryptocurrency from Kraken to your Binance account.

**Example Cost Calculation (2,000 Euro deposit via Kraken to Binance using Tron):**
*   Fiat deposit to Kraken: 0 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   Conversion from Euros to Tron: 0.16% (approximately 3.2 Euros for 2,000 Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>
*   Transfer Tron from Kraken to Binance: Approximately 0.10 USD (or about 10 cents Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>
*   **Total Estimated Cost**: Around 3.3 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>

### Using KuCoin as an intermediary

KuCoin can also be used as an intermediary. It may offer lower trading commissions, potentially 0.1% depending on your trading level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Converting 2,000 Euros at a 0.1% commission would be 2 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. You would then incur an additional commission for transferring the cryptocurrency to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

### Using Coinbase as an intermediary

Coinbase is considered one of the safer platforms, but it often has higher trading commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. However, fiat deposits on Coinbase can be very cheap, potentially costing only 0.50 to 0.75 Euros for SEPA transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. The main cost will be in [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | converting your fiat money]] to cryptocurrency on Coinbase before transferring it to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to consider all commissions and make an informed decision to save money when depositing funds to invest in the best products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

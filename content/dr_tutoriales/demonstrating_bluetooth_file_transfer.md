This guide outlines the process of [[activating_bluetooth_in_windows_10 | activating Bluetooth in Windows 10]] and connecting a mobile device, preparing the computer for [[using_bluetooth_to_transfer_files_between_mobile_and_pc | using Bluetooth to transfer files between mobile and PC]]. The steps are designed to ensure the Bluetooth service is properly configured and discoverable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>

## Initial Setup and Service Configuration

To begin, the primary step is to ensure the Bluetooth service on your Windows 10 computer is correctly configured. This is part of [[configuring_bluetooth_services_on_a_computer | configuring Bluetooth services on a computer]].

### Accessing Services

1.  Navigate to the home bar on your Windows 10 desktop. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>
2.  In the search bar, type "services" and open the "Services" application. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

### Configuring Bluetooth Compatibility Service

1.  Within the Services window, locate "Bluetooth compatibility service". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
2.  Right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility service" and select "Properties". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
3.  In the Properties window, set the "Startup type" to "Automatic". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
4.  Click "Apply" and then "Accept" to save these changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>
5.  Right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility service" again and select "Restart" to apply the changes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>
6.  Wait for the service to restart. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

## Activating Bluetooth and Displaying the Icon

After configuring the service, the next step is to ensure Bluetooth is activated and its icon is visible in the notification area. This is a key part of [[activating_bluetooth_in_windows_10 | activating Bluetooth in Windows 10]].

1.  Close the Services window. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
2.  Go back to the taskbar and search for "Bluetooth". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
3.  Open "Bluetooth settings and other devices". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>
4.  Once the "Bluetooth & other devices" window is open, navigate to "More Bluetooth options" on the right side. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>
5.  Ensure the option "Show the Bluetooth icon in the notification area" is selected. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> If it's not selected, check the box and click "OK". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>
    *   This action makes the Bluetooth symbol visible, indicating that Bluetooth is enabled on the computer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

## Connecting a Mobile Device

To demonstrate readiness for file transfer, a mobile device can be paired with the computer. This is a crucial step in a [[step_by_step_guide_for_mobile_and_desktop_transfers | step by step guide for mobile and desktop transfers]].

1.  Return to "Bluetooth and other devices" settings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
2.  Click on "Add Bluetooth or other devices". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
3.  Select "Bluetooth" from the options. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>
4.  Search for the mobile device you wish to add (e.g., an iPhone). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>
5.  Select your device when it appears in the list. The computer will attempt to connect. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>
6.  On your mobile device, accept the connection request from the computer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>

Once connected, the device is ready to communicate and transmit data between the mobile phone and the computer. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a> This enables functionalities like [[using_bluetooth_to_transfer_files_between_mobile_and_pc | using Bluetooth to transfer files between mobile and PC]].

### Related Tips for File Transfer

*   If you plan to transfer videos, consider [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reducing video file size for easier transfer]] to decrease transfer time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>
*   For transferring large files that might exceed email limits, [[sending_large_files_via_email | sending large files via email]] might not be ideal; Bluetooth can be an alternative if file size is manageable for the connection.

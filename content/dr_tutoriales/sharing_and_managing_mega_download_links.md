Mega is a web service primarily used for downloading and [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading content]] [00:00:17] [00:00:21]. It facilitates [[sharing_mediafire_file_links | file sharing]] between users, for purposes such as distributing series, movies, or documents [00:00:27] [00:00:31].

## Creating a Mega Account
To use Mega, you first need to [[how_to_create_a_mega_account | create an account]] [00:00:36]. This involves entering an email address and confirming it via an email link [00:00:45] [00:00:50] [00:00:53].

## Understanding Mega Storage Plans
Upon account creation, Mega offers various [[understanding_mega_storage_plans | storage plans]] [00:01:00]. The free plan provides up to 50 gigabytes of storage [00:01:08] [00:01:13], which is considered limited but sufficient for small or relatively small files [00:01:13] [00:01:17] [00:01:21]. Paid "Lite" or "Pro" accounts offer more storage options [00:01:33] [00:01:36]. This tutorial focuses on the default free account [00:01:41] [00:01:45].

## Optimizing Storage with Winrar
To maximize the 50 GB free storage, it's recommended to [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compress files]] before [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading]] [00:01:25].
1.  **Use Winrar:** Winrar is a program designed for file compression [00:02:47] [00:02:49].
2.  **Compressing a File:**
    *   Right-click on the file or folder you wish to compress [00:02:53].
    *   Select "Add to file" (indicated by the Winrar books logo) [00:02:56] [00:02:59].
    *   In the Winrar settings, choose "RAR" for the archive format [00:03:03].
    *   Set the compression method to "Best" [00:03:06].
    *   Select "Create solid archive" [00:03:10] [00:03:13].
    *   Click "Accept" to start the compression process [00:03:16].
    *   For example, a folder initially weighing 2.21 GB [00:02:29] containing 8 files [00:02:33] might occupy nearly 20 GB uncompressed [00:02:37]. After compression, the same content can be reduced significantly, such as to 13.1 GB, saving around 8-9 GB [00:03:42] [00:03:46] [00:03:54] [00:03:58].

## Uploading Files to Mega
Once files are ready (and optionally compressed), you can [[uploading_files_to_mega | upload them to Mega]]:
1.  Navigate to the "cloud" symbol in your Mega account [00:02:04].
2.  Choose to upload a "New folder," "files," or "upload folders" [00:02:07] [00:02:10].
3.  Select the desired file(s) from your computer [00:04:14].
4.  Click "Open" to begin the upload [00:04:18].

## Sharing and Managing Mega Download Links
After a file has been [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploaded]] to Mega, you can [[sharing_mediafire_file_links | share]] it with others [00:04:24] [00:04:29] [00:04:35].
1.  **Accessing the Link:**
    *   Locate the uploaded file in your Mega cloud [00:04:49] [00:04:52] [00:04:55].
    *   Right-click on the file [00:04:58].
    *   Select the "Manage link" option [00:05:04].
2.  **Understanding the Link with Key:**
    *   Mega provides a "link with key" [00:05:09] [00:05:22].
    *   The primary link itself allows access [00:05:11] [00:05:16].
    *   The "cipher key" is a separate encryption key required to download the content [00:05:22] [00:05:24] [00:05:28] [00:05:31].
3.  **Sharing the Link and Key:**
    *   Copy the main link [00:05:11].
    *   Click on "Cipher key" to copy the encryption key [00:05:24] [00:05:27].
    *   Share both the link and the key with those you want to access the content [00:05:16] [00:05:31].

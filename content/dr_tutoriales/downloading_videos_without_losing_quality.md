This guide explains a method to download videos from Facebook onto a computer using the mobile version of the site and browser inspection tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Steps to Download Facebook Videos

### 1. Access the Video on Facebook
Navigate to the video you wish to download on the Facebook main page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### 2. Switch to the Mobile Version
Modify the URL in your browser:
*   Remove the "WWW" and "HTTP" parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
*   Replace them with an "M" to access the mobile version of Facebook within your computer's browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   Press Enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### 3. Inspect the Video Element
Once on the mobile version page:
*   Right-click on a blank space in the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   Select "Inspect" from the context menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This will open a window on the right side of your screen showing the page's code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### 4. Play and Re-inspect the Video
*   Play the video for two or three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   After playing, click on the "inspect video" button (often a selection tool in the inspector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Click on the video element within the inspector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. You should see a section of code that highlights when you hover over the video, indicating the video's source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This highlighted code represents the origin of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### 5. Obtain and Download the Original Video Link
*   Double-click on the highlighted code related to the video's origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   Copy the URL that begins with "HTTP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   Open a new browser tab and paste this copied URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This will open the video in its original, root Facebook version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   On this new tab, click the three dots typically found on the video player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Select "Download" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

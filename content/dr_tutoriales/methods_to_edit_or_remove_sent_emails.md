This guide explains how to cancel, delete, or modify an email that has already been sent using Microsoft Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prerequisite for Recall

It is crucial that the recipient of the email has **not** yet opened the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. If the email has been opened, the recall function will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Steps to Recall or Replace an Email

1.  **Send the Email**: Begin by sending an email from your Outlook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, an email was sent to "Rafael Ruiz Iglesias" with the subject "subscribe and Like it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Sent Messages**: After sending, go to your "messages sent" folder within Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
3.  **Select the Email**: Locate the email you wish to recall or modify. Click on it to open its options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  **Choose an Action**: Once the email is open, you will see options to "edit the message" or "Remove" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
5.  **Initiate Recall/Replacement**: Click the specific button (represented by a symbol) to access the recall options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. You will be presented with two main choices:
    *   **Delete the message completely**: This option aims to delete the message entirely from the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Delete it and send another modification**: This allows you to delete the original email and immediately send a revised version, for example, if you forgot to add a closing remark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. The revised email will then be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
6.  **Receive Notification (Optional)**: Outlook can notify you whether the recall or modification was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. To proceed with the chosen action, confirm by clicking "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
7.  **Confirmation**: A confirmation message will appear, indicating that you have attempted to recall the message, along with the date and time of the attempt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. You will also receive a confirmation that the email has been "totally eliminated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

[[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]], also known as Liquid Pool, is a financial product offered on Binance that allows users to invest cryptocurrencies and other financial assets to potentially earn profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tutorial teaches users how to utilize it from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## How Liquid Swap Works
When using [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]], users provide liquidity with their cryptocurrencies or other assets (such as euros or dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. By providing liquidity, users make these coins available for others to buy, convert, exchange, or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Profitability is generated from the commissions charged for these transactions using the contributed coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Benefits of Investing in Liquid Swap
*   **Earning Commissions:** Users earn commissions based on the transactions performed with the cryptocurrencies they contribute to the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Profitability Display:** The platform displays potential returns, referred to as APY (Annual Percentage Yield), which is the profitability earned over seven days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For example, some coins might offer an APY of 7.80% or 44.00% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   **Reduced Fees for Dual Contributions:** When adding two currencies simultaneously, such as Bitcoin and BUSD, no commission is charged for providing this liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Adding only one currency, like Bitcoin separately, incurs a commission, reducing overall profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Profitability:** The product is designed for users to leave their money deposited for a relatively medium to long time frame to allow transactions to occur and generate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## [[understanding_the_risks_and_profitability_of_liquid_swap | Considerations and Risks]]

> [!CAUTION]
> It is crucial to understand that profitability in [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] is **not always guaranteed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Variable Profitability:** The displayed APY values are not fixed and can change significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This value depends entirely on the volume of transactions for those specific cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Potential for Negative Returns (Impermanent Loss):** Users can experience negative values if the price of the contributed cryptocurrencies drops after the transaction. If the depreciation of the coins outweighs the commissions earned from transactions, the overall profitability becomes negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. This happens if the value of the coins drops faster than the commissions accrued from transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Recommendation for High Volume Cryptocurrencies:** To mitigate [[understanding_the_risks_and_profitability_of_liquid_swap | risk]] and ensure fewer losses, it is recommended to use [[introduction_to_liquid_swap_on_binance | Liquid Swap]] with cryptocurrencies that have a high trading volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Commissions:** Commissions are charged when users withdraw their money from the pool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Terms and Conditions:** New users are advised to read the terms and conditions before using the product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## [[different_liquidity_options_stable_vs_innovative | Types of Liquidity]]
The platform offers two main types of liquidity:
*   **Stable Liquidity:** Products in this category have profitability that does not vary much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Innovation Liquidity:** These products tend to have more variable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Managing Your Participation
Users can choose to add or withdraw liquidity they have contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. They can view their contributions by going to "my participation," where they can see how much they have contributed to the market, total yield, and daily profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. A history of adding and withdrawing liquidity is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

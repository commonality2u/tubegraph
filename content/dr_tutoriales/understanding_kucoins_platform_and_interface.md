This tutorial provides an overview of the KuCoin platform, focusing on how to deposit capital and [[buying_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buy cryptocurrencies]]. It also covers key aspects of the interface, commission structures, and different account types within KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Platform Interface Overview

The KuCoin platform provides various menus and functions to manage cryptocurrency assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. When navigating, you will typically find sections for buying crypto, checking your assets, and accessing market information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## How to Deposit Capital on KuCoin

[[how_to_deposit_capital_on_kucoin | Depositing capital on KuCoin]] can be done using both fiat money and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

### Depositing Fiat Money

To deposit fiat currency (such as euros, USD, or pounds sterling), navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section in the top menu and select "Credit/Debit Card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. Other payment methods like Apple Pay or bank transfers may also be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

When choosing a currency, the platform will display available payment methods specific to that currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. For example, if you enter euros, you will see the minimum and maximum amounts, as well as different transfer methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>. It is recommended to convert fiat to a stablecoin like USDT to maintain a stable value, as opposed to directly buying volatile assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

The transfer process can be immediate for card payments, while other methods like SEPA transfers may take business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

### Depositing Cryptocurrencies

To deposit cryptocurrencies from another platform (e.g., [[navigating_the_binance_app_interface | Binance]]), go to the "Assets" section and click "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. Select the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin) and choose the "Main Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. KuCoin will provide a deposit address that you can copy and use on your external platform to initiate the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. The external platform will automatically detect the correct network based on the address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

## Understanding Commissions

Commissions are charged by payment channels that act as intermediaries between KuCoin and your fiat money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. For example, when depositing euros via a Visa/Mastercard, a payment channel like Pance processes the transfer and converts your fiat to a crypto asset like USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>. The commission for this service can be seen in the transfer details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

For [[trading_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kuCoin | trading and transferring cryptocurrencies on KuCoin]], the platform's trading commissions are typically 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. These commissions can decrease based on the volume of crypto assets you hold on the exchange, encouraging users to maintain higher volumes for discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>.

## KuCoin Account Types

KuCoin separates funds into different account types for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>:
*   **Main Account:** Used for depositing and withdrawing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
*   **Trading Account:** Where funds must be held to perform [[trading_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kuCoin | cryptocurrency trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.
*   **Margin Account:** For margin trading.
*   **Futures Account:** For futures trading.

To buy cryptocurrencies, you must first transfer your deposited funds from the Main Account to the Trading Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

## Trading and Markets

KuCoin offers a wide variety of cryptocurrencies and projects in its markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. To access the markets, navigate to the "Markets" tab on the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

When performing [[buying_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | buying cryptocurrencies on KuCoin]], you will interact with an interactive menu that includes:
*   **Price Chart:** Displays the cryptocurrency's price movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Order Book:** Shows active buy and sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Recent Operations:** Lists recently executed trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Technical Analysis Tools:** Allows users to draw trend lines and perform analysis on the chart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

When buying, ensure that the "Spot" option is selected, not "Margin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

### KuCoin Order Types

KuCoin offers several [[kucoin_order_types | order types]] for trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>:
*   **Market Order:** Buys or sells immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. This is the simplest order type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.
*   **Limited Order:** Allows you to set a specific price at which your order will be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
*   **Stop Limit Order:** Combines a stop price and a limit price.
*   **Stop Order:** An order that becomes a market order once a specified stop price is reached.

When placing a market order, the system automatically uses the best available market price, and you only need to specify the quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. After a successful order placement, you will find the purchased cryptocurrency in your trading account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

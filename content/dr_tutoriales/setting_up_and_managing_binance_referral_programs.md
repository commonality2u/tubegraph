Binance offers a referral program that allows users to invite friends to the platform and earn cryptocurrency commissions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. This program provides benefits for both the referrer and the referred individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Accessing the Referral Program

To access the [[how_binance_referrals_work | Binance referral program]], navigate to your profile on the Binance website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Within your profile, you will find a section labeled "Referral Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## Understanding Referral Benefits and Commission Structure

When someone opens an account using your [[benefits_of_using_binance_referral_links | Binance referral link]], they receive a 10% discount on commissions whenever they perform deposits, transactions, or withdrawals on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. As the referrer, you also receive a percentage of the commissions paid by your referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

The speaker typically offers a 10% discount to new users through his referral link, meaning the new user receives a 10% commission discount, and the speaker receives 10% of the commissions the user pays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

### Commission Sharing Options

Binance allows you to vary the commission percentages shared between you and your referred friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. When generating a new referral link, you can choose from different percentage splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>:
*   **10% for you / 10% for your friend** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>
*   **20% for you / 0% for your friend** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>

Higher referral percentages (e.g., 15% or 20% for yourself while giving 0% to the referred user) are available if your Binance account balance exceeds 500 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The speaker recommends choosing a split that benefits both parties, such as 10% for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Managing Referral Links and Statistics

Within the referral program interface, you'll find several sections to manage and monitor your referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>:

*   **Control Panel**: Displays an overview of your earnings and referral activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This panel shows total bitcoins earned, the number of transactions made by your referrals, and your total number of referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **List of Links**: Shows all the referral links you have generated, along with their respective commission splits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Friends List**: Provides a list of users who have signed up using your referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. While it doesn't show personal names for privacy reasons, it displays user IDs, account types (e.g., spot, mining, futures), registration times, and operational activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   **Commission History**: Details the commissions you have earned from your referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. You can filter this history by account type (e.g., spot, futures, mining) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. The commissions are typically received in the same cryptocurrency that your referred user traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. For example, if a referred user buys Polkadot (DOT), you will receive your commission in DOT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

iPhone allows users to customize their [[accessing_control_center_on_iphone | Control Center]] to quickly access frequently used functions, such as the [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recorder]].

## Adding Screen Recording to Control Center

To add the [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recorder]] option to your iPhone's [[accessing_control_center_on_iphone | Control Center]], follow these steps:
1.  Enter "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "[[accessing_control_center_on_iphone | Control Center]]" section, identifiable by a gray icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.
3.  Select "Customize Controls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
4.  Locate "[[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recording]]" among the available options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.
    *   If [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recording]] is already listed under "Include," it means it's active in your [[accessing_control_center_on_iphone | Control Center]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
5.  You can reorder the controls to your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Using the Screen Recorder

Once activated, the [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recorder]] can be accessed by sliding down from the top of the iPhone screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This provides immediate access to the [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | screen recorder]] function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Recording Audio with Screen Recording

The [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recorder]] also allows for [[recording_internal_and_external_audio_on_iphone | recording videos with internal mobile sound]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. To activate the microphone for recording external audio, keep the [[using_iphone_screen_recorder | Screen Recorder]] icon pressed in the [[accessing_control_center_on_iphone | Control Center]] to ensure the microphone is enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

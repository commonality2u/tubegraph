## Currency Exchange and [[using_advcash_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | Cryptocurrency Transactions]]

### Currency Exchange
Advcash allows users to exchange fiat currencies (e.g., USD, Euro, Rubles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>. For example, converting 100 Euros to USD yields slightly less than the real exchange rate, indicating a hidden commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. Users can add various currencies like the British Pound to their available wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Buying and Selling Cryptocurrencies
Advcash collaborates with the [[creating_and_verifying_a_binance_account | Binance]] platform for buying and selling cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Users can buy various cryptocurrencies directly from their Advcash account using the Binance exchange, which aims to provide competitive offers and ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:57">[00:23:57]</a>. It is generally recommended to use Binance for crypto purchases due to potentially high commissions when buying with a card directly on Advcash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

### Crypto Savings
Advcash integrates with the Nexo platform, allowing users to earn up to 8% annualized interest by keeping their cryptocurrencies on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>. Users can connect their Advcash account to Nexo to deposit cryptocurrencies and start earning interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. It is advised to compare interest rates directly on Nexo, as Advcash may retain a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:19">[00:26:19]</a>.

## Advcash Cards

Advcash offers both virtual and plastic cards that are separate from the main Advcash wallet, requiring funds to be loaded onto them before use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:59">[00:26:59]</a>.

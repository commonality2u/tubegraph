The [[binance_referral_program | Binance]] referral program allows users to invite friends and earn cryptocurrency together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:54">[01:13:54]</a>. Participants can earn up to 40% commission every time their friends engage in trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:37">[01:15:37]</a>.

The program works by allowing users to make a person open an account using their unique referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:50">[01:47:50]</a>. When the referred person pays [[reducing_binance_commissions | commissions]] for deposits, transactions, or withdrawals, they receive a 10% discount on those [[reducing_binance_commissions | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:33">[01:57:33]</a>. The referrer then receives that 10% from the commissions paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:34">[02:07:34]</a>.

## Accessing the Referral Program on Mobile

To access the [[binance_referral_program | Binance]] referral program on a mobile phone:
1.  Open the [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_phone | Binance application]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:77">[07:04:77]</a>.
2.  Once open, navigate to your profile section, which is typically found at the top left of the [[navigating_the_binance_app_interface | interface]] where a person icon appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:93">[07:07:93]</a>.
3.  Select the "Referral Program" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:41">[07:14:41]</a>.

## Mobile Referral Interface

On the mobile app, you will find a menu very similar to the desktop version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:80">[07:17:80]</a>. This section displays:
*   A list of friends who have used your referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:65">[07:21:65]</a>.
*   Details of transactions made by your referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:40">[07:23:40]</a>.

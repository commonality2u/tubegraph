## Limitations of the Convert Method

The "Convert" method has certain limitations:
*   **Availability:** It only allows conversions between cryptocurrencies that are directly available for this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, if you want to convert a cryptocurrency like Polkadot (DOT) and it's not listed as an option, you cannot use this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Minimum Quantity:** There is a minimum quantity requirement for certain currency conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. If your amount is below this minimum, the conversion cannot proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

For cryptocurrencies not supported by the direct [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | convert method]], users might need to use the "Markets" section (Method 2), which involves more complex trading processes like spot trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## Commissions and Fees

Binance states that it does not charge any commission for OTC (Over-The-Counter) operations when using the "Convert" feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, there may be a "spread" applied, which means the prices offered might be slightly different from the market's live prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. There is no direct commission associated with a cryptocurrency [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | conversion]] using this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

YouTube channels typically do not permit [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes]] unless the channel has this capability enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. If a channel attempts to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload a video]] longer than 15 minutes without this permission, the upload will be blocked and may get stuck at 99% processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is not an error but a necessary permission for new channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Enabling the Permission for Longer Videos

To enable the permission to [[how_to_upload_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos longer than 15 minutes]], follow these steps:

1.  Navigate to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] for the channel where you wish to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload the longer video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  Within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]], switch to the classic version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This allows for quicker access to the necessary settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  In the classic version, click on the "Channel" option located in the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  After clicking "Channel," various options and current channel permissions will appear, such as upload, monetization, and direct broadcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
5.  Locate the section related to "longer lasting victims" (referring to the feature for [[requirements_for_uploading_longer_videos_on_youtube | uploading longer videos]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This window controls the ability to [[requirements_for_uploading_longer_videos_on_youtube | upload videos greater than fifteen minutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Typically, an unverified channel will show this option as "No" or "not allowed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## [[youtube_channel_verification_process | Account Verification Process]]

To enable the feature for longer videos, you must [[youtube_account_verification | verify your YouTube account]]:

1.  Access the verification section from the "Channel" settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
2.  You will need to verify that the [[youtube_account_verification | YouTube account]] belongs to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This verification can be done from a computer, an Android device, or an iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
3.  A confirmation code will be sent to your mobile phone, Gmail, or the email address associated with the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
4.  Use this confirmation code to prove ownership of the [[youtube_account_verification | YouTube account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Once this verification process is complete and the feature is enabled, you will be able to [[how_to_upload_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes]] without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

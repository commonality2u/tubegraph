This article provides a guide on how to [[steps_to_deposit_funds_into_a_paypal_account | deposit funds]] into a PayPal account and [[transferring_money_between_a_bank_and_paypal | transfer money between a bank and PayPal]] [00:00:00]. While the tutorial uses a computer screen for demonstration, the steps are identical for mobile devices [00:00:37].

## Accessing the Transfer Money Option

To begin, ensure you are logged into your PayPal account [00:00:43].

There are two main paths to find the transfer money option:
*   Navigate to the "PayPal balance" section [00:00:48].
*   Go to "my wallet" [00:01:03].
Both sections provide the "Transfer money" option [00:01:06]. Users can also manage different currencies, such as adding pounds if euros are the primary currency [00:01:08].

## Options for Depositing Funds

When you select "transfer money," you will be presented with choices for the direction of the transfer [00:01:16]:
*   From your PayPal account to the bank.
*   From the bank to your PayPal account.

To [[steps_to_deposit_funds_into_a_paypal_account | add money to your PayPal balance]], you must select "Add money to your balance PayPal" [00:01:24].

A crucial prerequisite for depositing funds is to have a bank account [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to PayPal]] [00:01:28].

> [!important] Unlinked Accounts
> If you attempt a transfer without a [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked bank account]], the transfer will be [[common_issues_and_solutions_when_transferring_funds_to_paypal | automatically rejected]] as PayPal will not recognize the bank account as associated with your PayPal account [00:01:44].

### How to [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | Link Your Bank Account]]

The process of [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linking a bank account]] typically takes one to two days [00:02:08]. PayPal facilitates this by:
1.  Making a small transfer (e.g., one cent) to your bank account [00:02:11].
2.  You will then need to [[verification_process_for_linking_bank_accounts_with_paypal | confirm the exact amount of that transfer]] within PayPal (e.g., if PayPal sends a penny, you confirm it was a penny) [00:02:14].
Once this verification is complete, your bank account will be successfully [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to your PayPal account]] [00:02:22].

## Making the Deposit (Once Linked)

After your bank account is successfully [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]], you can proceed with the deposit [00:02:28].
1.  **Use Bank Transfer Details:** You will use the bank account details provided by PayPal on the screen [00:01:33], which include the IBAN and the beneficiary bank [00:02:31].
2.  **Beneficiary Name:** It is important to enter the correct name of the beneficiary [00:02:40].
3.  **Concept/Reference:** You do not need to put anything in the concept or reference field for the transfer [00:02:37].
4.  **Confirmation:** You will receive an email confirmation once the deposit is complete [00:02:42].

> [!tip] Transfer Timeframe
> Bank transfers can take one to two days to process [00:02:44]. It's important to note that these timeframes refer to working days, so weekends and holidays do not count within this period [00:02:47].

Translating PDF documents can be done using various [[methods_to_translate_a_pdf_document | methods]]. One common approach involves using [[online_translation_tools_for_pdfs | online translation tools]], such as Google Translate, which is a free service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Requirements for Translation

Before translating a document, it's crucial that the PDF recognizes the content as editable text rather than a scanned image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. If the document is a scanned page, it is in image format and cannot be translated directly by these methods; it would first need to be transformed into text format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Binance provides an easy and intuitive way to [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | exchange cryptocurrencies]], allowing users to manage their spot portfolio and gain profitability based on market analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The platform offers two primary methods for converting cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Method 1: The Convert Method

This is a simple and straightforward method for direct cryptocurrency conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Steps to Convert

1.  **Navigate to Convert:** Go to the "trading" tab at the top of the Binance platform, then select the "convert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
2.  **Select Cryptocurrencies:** Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to convert from and the target cryptocurrency you want to convert to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
    *   **Limitation:** This method is only available if your desired target cryptocurrency is listed as an option for direct conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. For instance, converting directly from `BNB` to `Polkadot` (DOT) might not be an available option with this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  **Enter Amount:** Input the amount you wish to convert, or select "maximum" to convert your entire balance of the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   **Minimum Quantity:** Be aware that there might be a minimum quantity required for certain conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
4.  **Preview Conversion:** Click "preview conversion" to see the details of your transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Conversion:** A conversion price will appear. Due to cryptocurrency volatility, you typically have five seconds to confirm the conversion before the price updates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
6.  **View Converted Balance:** Once confirmed, your cryptocurrency will be converted, and the converted quantity and price will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. You can also view the status of your conversions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Commissions with Method 1

Binance generally does not charge commissions for Over-The-Counter (OTC) operations when [[using_binances_convert_method_for_cryptocurrencies | using Binance's convert method]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. However, there might be a spread applied to the prices, meaning the conversion occurs at various market prices rather than a fixed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

## Method 2: Market Trading for Conversion

This method is slightly more complex but offers flexibility when direct conversion (Method 1) is not available for specific cryptocurrency pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It involves performing two steps if a direct conversion isn't possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Steps for Market Trading Conversion

1.  **Navigate to Markets:** Go to the Binance platform and select the "markets" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
2.  **Select Trading Pair:**
    *   Choose the cryptocurrency you want to convert from (e.g., `USDT`) and select a common base pair, like `BNB` or `Bitcoin`, that is readily available for conversion to your final desired cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   For example, if you want to convert `USDT` to `BNB`, you would search for the `BNB/USDT` pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  **Place a Market Order:**
    *   Within the trading interface for the chosen pair, select a "market order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. This means the trade will execute immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Enter the total amount of your initial cryptocurrency (e.g., `USDT`) you wish to use to buy the intermediate cryptocurrency (e.g., `BNB`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   Execute the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
4.  **Second Conversion (if needed):** If your target cryptocurrency wasn't directly available with your initial currency, you will now perform a second market order. For example, if you bought `BNB` and now want `Polkadot` (DOT), you would find the `BNB/DOT` trading pair and convert your `BNB` to `DOT` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

### Commissions with Method 2

When [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | exchanging cryptocurrencies]] using market orders, standard trading fees apply. These fees are typically a small percentage of the trade value.

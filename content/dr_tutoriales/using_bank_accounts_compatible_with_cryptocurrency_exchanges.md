Withdrawing capital from cryptocurrency platforms to a bank account requires understanding which banks are compatible with crypto exchanges. While platforms like KuCoin allow for crypto deposits and withdrawals, they often do not directly support withdrawals of national (fiat) currencies to a bank account due to intermediary companies involved in deposits not performing the same function for withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. This necessitates transferring cryptocurrency to another platform that facilitates fiat withdrawals to bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## Challenges with Traditional Banks

When attempting to [[withdrawing_cryptocurrency_funds_to_a_bank_account | withdraw cryptocurrency funds to a bank account]], certain traditional banks may block transactions with crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Examples of conventional banking institutions that have been known to block these transactions include:
*   Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>
*   BBVA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>
*   ING <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>

If a transaction is blocked, the money typically returns to the exchange platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. While some individuals report successful transactions with conventional banks, personal experiences indicate that it is often not permitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Recommended Compatible Banks

To avoid issues when [[withdrawing_cryptocurrency_funds_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing cryptocurrency funds]], it is recommended to use specific types of bank accounts that are known to be compatible with crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Neobanks are particularly recommended because they generally allow these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Examples of [[using_neobanks_like_revolut_and_n26_for_crypto_withdrawals | neobanks]] that are compatible with crypto exchanges include:
*   N26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>
*   Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>
*   Living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

These [[using_neobanks_like_revolut_and_n26_for_crypto_withdrawals | neobanks]] often offer free accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Transferring Funds to a Compatible Exchange

Since some platforms like KuCoin don't support direct fiat withdrawals, the common process is to [[transferring_cryptocurrency_between_platforms | transfer cryptocurrency]] from KuCoin to another exchange that does support fiat withdrawals to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Platforms that facilitate cryptocurrency withdrawals to bank accounts include:
*   Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>
*   Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>

When [[transferring_cryptocurrency_between_platforms | transferring cryptocurrency between platforms]], it's advisable to choose a cryptocurrency with a relatively low blockchain fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. For example, transferring USDT via the TRC-20 network incurs a lower commission (e.g., 1 USDT) compared to the ERC-20 network (e.g., 20-25 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Once the cryptocurrency arrives on the compatible exchange (e.g., Kraken), it can be converted to fiat currency (like Euros or Dollars) and then sent to the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. After conversion, the funds can be withdrawn via wire, Swift, or card, or by adding bank account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

> [!tip] Commission Savings
> While Kraken generally charges a relatively normal commission for conversion, for larger capital transfers and greater commission savings, it might be beneficial to use Kraken Pro for transactions and then return to the main Kraken platform for withdrawal to the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Adjusting the volume of your microphone on a computer or laptop is crucial for facilitating subsequent audio editing and ensuring clarity for subscribers and listeners during live streams or recordings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This guide outlines two methods to [[methods_to_enhance_audio_volume_during_recording | enhance audio volume]] for your microphone.

## Method 1: Adjusting Volume via Windows Sound Settings

This method focuses on increasing microphone volume directly through your operating system's sound settings.

### Accessing Sound Settings
1.  Go to the Start taskbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.
2.  Type "sound" into the search bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  Select "Sound settings" from the results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Configuring Microphone Input
1.  Within the Sound settings, navigate to the "Input" section, as "Output" controls speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
2.  Select the specific microphone you wish to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
3.  Click on "[[using_device_properties_to_manage_microphone_settings | Device properties]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
4.  The microphone volume is typically set to 100%, which represents the maximum volume the microphone can capture without degrading sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] [[impact_of_increasing_microphone_volume_on_audio_quality | Impact of increasing microphone volume on audio quality]]
> Increasing the microphone volume beyond its standard maximum can significantly decrease sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Keeping it at 100% maintains the quality allowed by the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

#### For Windows 10 Users
If a different window appears when adjusting sound settings, navigate to the "Levels" section. Here, the microphone level should also appear at 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Apply the changes to set the volume to its maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Method 2: Adjusting Volume Using OBS (Open Broadcaster Software)

This method provides an alternative way to adjust microphone volume, particularly useful for recording or streaming, and often involves a program like OBS (Open Broadcaster Software).

> [!NOTE]
> This method requires downloading a program, such as OBS, which can often be found via a link in the video's description or comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The program facilitates recording videos at desired volumes, which can then be modified or converted to audio format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Steps within OBS
1.  In OBS, go to the "Microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  Click "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
3.  Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
4.  Choose the microphone you wish to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
5.  Once the microphone is selected, go to the "Audio Mixer" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
6.  Right-click with your mouse and select "Advanced Audio Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
7.  This will display the different microphones or audio sources currently interacting with your recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
8.  The default standard volume is 0.0 decibels, which corresponds to 100% of the microphone's selected volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. You can increase the volume progressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Increasing the volume using this technique will also increase the volume of the audio, but it may cause the audio quality to sound slightly worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This trade-off between volume and quality should be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Once a Google Form has been [[how_to_create_a_google_form | created]] and customized, it can be shared with others or embedded into a website to gather responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Accessing the Send Options

To share the form, navigate to the "Send" option within the Google Forms interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. This provides several methods for distribution.

## Sharing via Email

Forms can be sent directly via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **Recipient Visibility:** When sending via email, the sender's email address will be visible to the recipient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Anonymity:** If anonymity is desired for a [[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | survey]] or form, using an email direct send is not recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

## Sharing via Link

A shareable link can be generated for the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
*   **Shorten URL:** The URL can be shortened for easier sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Distribution:** This link can be copied and shared across various platforms, allowing people to access the form directly by opening it in a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   **Recommended for Anonymity:** For forms where anonymity is preferred (e.g., [[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | surveys]]), sharing the link is the recommended method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Embedding with HTML

Google Forms can be embedded into a web page using HTML code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Limitation:** HTML code for embedding **cannot be generated** if the form includes an option for users to upload files to Google Drive (e.g., uploading screenshots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
*   **Workaround:** To generate the HTML code for embedding, any questions requiring file uploads must first be deleted from the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Once these questions are removed, the HTML code can be generated and inserted into a website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Post-Application Requirements

Upon submission, the application is reviewed. To become fully active, you must generate three assigned sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Bank details for payment can be entered immediately or after the application is accepted and sales have been generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. It is generally recommended to wait until the application is confirmed and sales have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Once the application is approved and requirements are met, users are redirected to the Amazon page, ready to begin recommending products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### How to Promote Products

Even without a formal website or business, individuals can promote products through social media profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. A simple Facebook page can serve as a web page for promotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

A common approach to [[Optimizing Amazon Product Promotion for Increased Sales | promoting products]] is to share the affiliate link directly with friends or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. For example, if a family member plans to buy a product on Amazon, you can offer to send them your link, allowing them to purchase the product at the same price while you earn a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</sup>. This strategy makes it a mutually beneficial transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

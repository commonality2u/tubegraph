This guide details how to manage which applications have their notifications announced by Siri through your [[customizing_siri_notifications_with_airpods | AirPods]]. You can also [[deactivating_airpods_notifications | deactivate notifications]] entirely.

## Accessing Notification Settings

To begin, navigate to the **Settings** on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Ensure your iPhone is connected with your [[managing_iphone_notification_settings_for_airpods | AirPods]] (e.g., "Rafael's AirPods Pro") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

1.  From the main **Settings** menu, locate and select **Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
    *   If **Notifications** is not immediately visible, use the search bar (magnifying glass icon) at the top and type "Notifications" to find the section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Managing Siri Announce Notifications

Within the **Notifications** section, you will see various options for [[how_to_adjust_notification_settings_for_different_applications_on_iphone | how notifications are displayed]] (e.g., group, list, or count) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

1.  Look for the **Siri** section, specifically **Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Tap on **Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  Here, you'll find a toggle to **Announce Notifications** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This setting dictates whether Siri announces notifications when your headphones (AirPods) are on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   If you wish to stop Siri from reading notifications aloud, simply deactivate this toggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This will prevent Siri from announcing notifications through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   If activated, you may also have the option to "Respond Without Confirmation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Selecting Specific Applications for Announcement

Below the main "Announce Notifications" toggle, you can choose which specific applications Siri will announce notifications for via your headphones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

1.  Scroll down to see a list of your installed applications.
2.  For each application, you can toggle whether Siri should announce its notifications through your [[customizing_siri_notifications_with_airpods | AirPods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   For example, if "Fever" is listed as an app, you can choose to have its notifications announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   To stop announcements for a specific app, simply toggle off its setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This will prevent Siri from announcing notifications for that particular app through your AirPods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

By following these steps, you can precisely control which application notifications Siri announces through your AirPods, tailoring your notification experience.

To maximize the effectiveness of your [[creating_amazon_affiliate_links | Amazon affiliate links]], it's often beneficial to use shorter versions of the URLs. Shorter links are more visually appealing and can encourage more clicks, leading to increased commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. There are two primary methods to obtain these shortened links.

## Method 1: Using the Amazon Affiliates Dashboard

This method involves searching for products directly within your Amazon Affiliates account.

1.  **Access Your Account**: Log in to your Amazon Affiliates account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. If you don't have an account, [[amazon_affiliate_program_basics | creating one]] is "super easy, super simple and in five minutes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Product Links**: On the Amazon Affiliates screen, locate and click on the "product links" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. Then, select the "product links" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

4.  **Obtain the Link**: Once you find the desired product, click the small arrow next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Initially, you might get a "great size" (long) link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
5.  **Shorten the URL**: To shorten the link, click the arrow again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

Confirm this option to generate a "shorter amazon link affiliates" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

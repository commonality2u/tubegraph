Converting YouTube videos to text is a straightforward process, particularly when utilizing artificial intelligence (AI) tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This can be achieved efficiently using a [[google_chrome_extension_for_transcribing_youtube_videos | Google Chrome extension]] that integrates AI technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Glass Google Chrome Extension

The primary tool demonstrated for this conversion is a [[google_chrome_extension_for_transcribing_youtube_videos | Google Chrome extension]] named "Glass" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This extension leverages [[accuracy_and_reliability_of_audio_transcription_tools | ChatGPT]] to perform the conversion of YouTube video content into text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

### Installation and Usage

To use the Glass extension:
1.  Install the Glass extension from the Chrome Web Store onto your [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  Open a new tab and navigate to the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
3.  Select and enter any video you wish to transcribe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
4.  Once the extension is installed, a small window labeled "transcript and summery" (meaning "Transcript and abstract") will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Click on this window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Transcribing Video Content

Upon clicking the "transcript and summery" window, the extension will display the video's content as text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This includes:
*   A paragraph for each minute or sequence of seconds, representing what the person in the video is saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   The full transcript of the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For example, a nine-minute and twenty-five-second video will have its full transcript available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Exporting and Copying Transcriptions

The transcribed text can be easily copied for various uses:
*   **Manual Selection**: Users can select the desired text, copy it, and then paste it into a document like Word <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Direct Copy**: The extension provides a direct "Copy here as text" option, which copies the entire transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

This method simplifies the process of [[steps_to_transcribe_youtube_videos_to_text | converting YouTube videos to text]] using AI-powered tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Alternative Options

While the video focuses on the Chrome extension, it briefly mentions that the "parent code" can also be used with [[integration_with_python_for_transcribing_videos | Python]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

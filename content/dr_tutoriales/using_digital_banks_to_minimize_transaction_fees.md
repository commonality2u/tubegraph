Minimizing transaction fees is crucial when managing cryptocurrency, as it helps save money that can be used to acquire more cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>. One effective strategy to reduce commissions, particularly for fiat deposits and withdrawals, involves using digital banks.

## Why Use Digital Banks for Fiat Transactions?

When depositing or withdrawing national currencies like euros or dollars, traditional bank transfers can incur commissions, especially if the transaction involves different countries or regions (e.g., transfers from Europe to the UK post-Brexit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. Digital banks offer a solution to avoid these charges.

### Recommended Digital Bank: N26

The N26 Bank is a digital bank recommended for carrying out transactions with zero commissions, even when dealing with countries outside the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:40">[03:06:40]</a>.

*   **Zero Commissions**: N26 allows users to perform transactions to countries like the United Kingdom or the United States without incurring any commission fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:06">[03:15:06]</a>.
*   **Fiat Deposits**: By using N26 for bank transfers, fiat deposits can be made with zero commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:15">[03:22:15]</a>. These transfers typically take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:46">[03:27:46]</a>.
*   **Fiat Withdrawals**: Similarly, for fiat withdrawals via bank transfer, utilizing N26 can help avoid commissions that would otherwise be charged by Spanish banks when receiving transfers from an English country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:56:06">[10:56:06]</a>. While bank card withdrawals are quicker, bank transfers using N26 are recommended for greater commission savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:10">[11:39:10]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Always choose bank transfer over bank card when depositing or withdrawing fiat currency, as it generally allows for more significant commission savings, especially with a digital bank like N26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:40">[11:41:40]</a>.

## Other Methods to Reduce Fees

While digital banks help with fiat transactions, other strategies exist for [[reducing_binance_commissions | reducing Binance commissions]] on cryptocurrency operations:

*   **Referral Links**: Using a referral link when creating a new account can provide a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, transactions, operations, or capital movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
*   [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | Getting discounts on Binance transaction fees]] by paying with BNB: Enabling the option to pay commissions with BNB (Binance Coin) offers a 25% discount, reducing the commission rate from 0.1% to 0.075% on buy/sell operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

*   **VIP Levels**: Higher trading volume and BNB holdings can increase your VIP level, leading to lower commission rates on trades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:21">[06:25:21]</a>.
*   **Internal Transfers**: Transfers between different wallets within the same Binance account (e.g., from spot wallet to futures wallet) are free of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:47">[05:04:47]</a>.

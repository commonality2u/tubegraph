To begin, navigate to your iPhone's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. If you cannot locate it directly, you can search for "Adjustments" (Settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Once in the settings menu:
1.  Scroll down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.
2.  Select "Privacy & Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This section is identified by a blue hand symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Within "Privacy & Security," you will find sections for "Localization" (Location Services) and "Tracking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Deactivating Location Services Globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

You can directly access the "Location" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. To [[how_to_deactivate_location_services_on_ios | deactivate location services on iOS]] for all applications, simply toggle off the main switch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Find My iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>

The "Find My iPhone" option can be activated to help locate your device if it is lost or stolen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Managing Location for Individual Applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

A key feature is the ability to [[managing_location_settings_for_individual_apps_on_iphone | manage location settings for individual apps on iPhone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This allows you to set specific location access permissions for each application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

The available options for each app include:
*   **Used When Using App**: Location is accessed only when the app is actively in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   **Ask Next Time**: The app will prompt you for location access each time it needs it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Never**: The app will never have access to your location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Always**: The app can access your location at any time, even when not in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This functionality allows you to tailor your mobile phone's location management based on specific applications and their usage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Some applications, like Uber or Bolt, might require location services to be enabled for proper functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

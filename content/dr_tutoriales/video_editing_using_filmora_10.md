Filmora 10 is a video editing software available for computer use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is used for the editing of videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This guide explains how to use Filmora 10 for video editing and how to effectively remove its watermark from exported videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Basic Workflow in Filmora 10

To begin [[using_filmora_for_editing_anime_videos | editing videos]] in Filmora 10, the first step is to import the desired video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. For example, one might import a [[video_tutorial_creation | video tutorial]] that demonstrates how to disable AirPod notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Once the video is edited, a preview is available within the software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### The Watermark Issue

A key challenge with Filmora 10 is that if you directly export and save the video, it will be saved with a watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This watermark can be intrusive and is what this guide aims to help avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## [[removing_filmora_10_watermark | Removing Filmora 10 Watermark]]

To avoid the Filmora 10 watermark when [[exporting_videos_without_watermark | exporting videos]], an alternative method involving screen recording software is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Using OBS Studio

The recommended program for this method is **OBS Studio** (Open Broadcaster Software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. OBS Studio is a tool that records the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

**Steps to Record Filmora 10 with OBS Studio:**

1.  **Download OBS Studio**: First, download and install OBS Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
2.  **Open Filmora 10**: Have Filmora 10 open on your computer with your edited video ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  **Configure OBS for Screen Recording**:
    *   Minimize the OBS window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   In OBS, select the screen where Filmora 10 is open as the capture source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   Make the Filmora 10 screen full-size (maximized) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
4.  **Start Recording**: In OBS, initiate the recording function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
5.  **Play Video in Filmora 10**: Play the edited video directly within Filmora 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
6.  **Export Outcome**: OBS will record both the screen and the sound of the Filmora 10 playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This process allows you to save the video as a file recorded by OBS, effectively bypassing the Filmora 10 export function and its associated watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, enabling you to [[exporting_videos_without_watermark | export videos without the Filmora watermark]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

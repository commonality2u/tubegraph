[[Activating comments on YouTube videos | Activating comments]] on your [[creating_and_managing_youtube_channel | YouTube videos]] is essential for [[growing_your_youtube_channel | channel growth]] and encouraging viewer engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The more interaction and comments your videos receive, the more YouTube will promote them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Even negative comments contribute to interaction and can help position your videos more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Key Considerations for Activating Comments

To ensure comments are active on your videos, there are three important considerations within the [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>:

### 1. Channel-Level Setting

The first step is to adjust your overall channel settings:
1.  Go to [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  Select "Channel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
4.  In "Advanced settings," ensure that your channel is *not* marked as "created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If marked as a channel for children, comments will be banned across all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Select "No, it's not made for kids" to allow comments on all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### 2. Video-Specific Setting

Even if your channel is not set for children, individual videos can still have comments blocked if they are designated as "made for kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
1.  In [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]], go to the "Details" section of the specific video you want to edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
2.  Under the "Audience" section, ensure you select "No, it's not made for kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. If it's set to "Yes," YouTube will block all comments for that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### 3. Allowing Comments in Video Settings

After ensuring the above settings, you must explicitly allow comments within the video's advanced options:
1.  From the video's "Details" page, scroll down and click "Show More" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  Locate the "Comments and ratings" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
3.  Select "Allow all comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. If this option is disabled, viewers will not be able to comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Always choose "Allow all comments" to maximize interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. You can later review and moderate comments that are inappropriate or disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

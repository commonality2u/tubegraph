[[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | Scheduling emails in Outlook]] allows users to prepare messages in advance and send them at a specific time and date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This functionality is part of the [[techniques_to_schedule_and_organize_emails_in_outlook | techniques to schedule and organize emails in Outlook]] for efficient communication.

## How to Schedule an Email

To [[delaying_email_delivery_in_outlook | delay email delivery in Outlook]], follow these steps:
1.  Open Outlook and navigate to the mail section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  Create a new email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
3.  Compose the email with the desired content, recipient, and subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
4.  Once the email is written, go to the "Options" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
5.  Select "Delay Delivery" or "Delay Shipment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
6.  In the delivery options, choose the desired date and time for the email to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For example, you can schedule it for the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
7.  Click "Close" and then "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Critical Requirement for Scheduled Emails

A crucial consideration for scheduled emails in Outlook is that the email will **only be sent if the computer is on and the Outlook application is open** at the scheduled delivery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If Outlook is not running at the specified time, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This is considered a weak point of Outlook's scheduling functionality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Setting Email Expiration

Outlook also allows for [[setting_email_expiration_in_outlook | setting an expiration date]] for a scheduled email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This feature means that if the email hasn't been sent by a certain date (due to Outlook not being open, for example), it will expire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. You can specify this expiration date within the "Delay Delivery" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Modifying Scheduled Emails

Scheduled emails are stored in your Outlook Outbox until their designated send time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. To [[editing_and_modifying_sent_emails_in_outlook | edit and modify a scheduled email]], follow these steps:
1.  Navigate to your Outbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  Locate and open the scheduled email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
3.  Go to the "Options" tab and select "Delay Delivery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  Adjust the delivery date and time as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
5.  Click "Close" and then "Send" to [[updating_scheduled_email_settings_in_outlook | update the schedule of the email sending]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Remember, for any updates or the initial sending to occur, Outlook must be open at the time of the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

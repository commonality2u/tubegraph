Reducing the [[video_compression | file size]] of videos can be beneficial for easier sharing via platforms like WhatsApp or email, and for conserving storage space on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This process aims to significantly decrease the file's weight without compromising its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Tool Requirement
The primary tool required for this process is VLC media player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. VLC is capable of opening and playing video files, as well as providing editing functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_video_compression_tutorial | Step-by-Step Video Compression with VLC]]
To illustrate the process, an example of a "Dark" series chapter, initially weighing 1.93 GB in HD quality with multiple audio tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, is used.

1.  **Open VLC Media Player**: Begin by opening the VLC program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Access Conversion Function**: Navigate to "Media" in the top left corner, then select "Convert/Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
3.  **Add File**: In the new screen, click "Add" to select the video file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Convert/Save**: After adding the file, click the "Convert/Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
5.  **Configure Settings**: This is a crucial step to ensure quality is maintained while achieving compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Profile**: Select "H.264 + MP3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   **Settings (Tools icon)**:
        *   **Encapsulation**: Must be set to "MP4/MV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
        *   **Video Codec**: Ensure it is "H.264" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
        *   **Bitrate**: Set to "Same as the source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
        *   **Resolution**: Crucially, set the scale to "1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
        *   **Filters**: No changes needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
        *   **Audio**: It is recommended to keep "Original audio" to prevent loss of sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
6.  **Save Configuration**: Click "Save" after configuring these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
7.  **Choose Export Destination**: Select where the compressed file will be saved and assign a name (e.g., "compressed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
8.  **Start Conversion**: Begin the conversion process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. VLC will display a loading bar indicating the progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The video will be fully converted once the bar reaches the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Results of [[video_compression | Video Compression]]
Following this method, the example video, initially 1.93 GB, was successfully reduced to 384 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This represents a reduction of almost two-thirds of the original file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Crucially, the video retained its quality and audio intact after compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

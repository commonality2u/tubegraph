This guide outlines the process of [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | withdrawing your cryptocurrency]] or money from Coinbase to your bank account. An alternative option for [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_paypal | withdrawing funds to a PayPal account]] is also available through a separate tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Preparing for Withdrawal: Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Money

Before you can withdraw funds to a bank account, any cryptocurrencies held must first be converted into fiat currency (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Cryptocurrencies like Polygon Matic cannot be directly transferred to traditional bank accounts as they are not legal tender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Steps to Convert Cryptocurrency:
1.  Navigate to the "Operate" or "Sell" section on Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  Search for the specific cryptocurrency you wish to convert (e.g., Matic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
3.  Select the "Sell" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
4.  Choose to sell "everything" to convert your crypto balance to fiat currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Note on Fees:** Be aware of transaction fees. For instance, selling 2.76 Matic might incur a 1 Euro commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. For [[avoiding_high_transaction_fees_when_withdrawing_from_coinbase | lower commissions]], consider using Coinbase Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Withdrawing Fiat Money to Your Bank Account

Once your cryptocurrency has been sold and converted into fiat money (e.g., Euros), you can proceed with the withdrawal to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Steps to Withdraw:
1.  Go to the Euro section of your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  Select the "Withdraw Funds" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw (e.g., 50 Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
4.  Proceed to the next step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
5.  Choose your withdrawal method:
    *   **Debit/Credit Card:** You can add a debit or credit card for withdrawal. However, this method is **not recommended** due to high commissions, typically around 1.5% to 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
    *   **Bank Account:** You can add a new bank account or select a previously linked one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This method typically incurs a lower commission of 0.15 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   **PayPal:** Withdrawals to PayPal are generally free of commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
6.  Confirm your chosen withdrawal method and click "Continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Withdrawal Processing Time:
*   **Bank Transfer:** Typically takes about one to two days for the funds to appear in your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **PayPal:** Usually takes about one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
A confirmation email will be sent to the email address associated with your Coinbase account once the withdrawal is processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

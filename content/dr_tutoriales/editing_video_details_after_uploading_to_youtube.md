## Post-Upload Processing and Checks

Upon [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | uploading a video]], YouTube processes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. During this processing, YouTube checks for several factors:
*   **Copyright rules violations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Adherence to YouTube's requirements and censorship rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This ensures content is appropriate for the platform and avoids certain topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

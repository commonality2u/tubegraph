Trust Wallet is a cryptocurrency application designed to be used on mobile devices, offering the same [[trust_wallet_functionalities_for_android_and_ios | functionalities]] for both Android and iOS operating systems [00:00:09 | 00:00:17]. This guide provides a step-by-step overview of how to use Trust Wallet.

## Getting Started with Trust Wallet

To begin using Trust Wallet, the first step is to download the application to your mobile device [00:00:54 | 00:00:55]. Once downloaded, you can either [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | import an existing wallet]] or [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | create a new one]] [00:01:01 | 00:01:03].

### Creating a New Wallet

If you choose to create a new wallet [00:01:03 | 00:01:05]:
1.  You will need to accept the privacy policy [00:01:17 | 00:01:20].
2.  An access code (password) will need to be entered twice for security [00:01:22 | 00:01:26].
3.  The application will prompt you to back up your wallet's security [00:01:29 | 00:01:31].
4.  You will then be shown a 12-word secret phrase [00:01:33 | 00:01:35]. This phrase is crucial for recovering your funds; losing it means losing access to your funds, and sharing it exposes your funds to theft [00:01:36 | 00:01:48]. Trust Wallet is not responsible for lost funds [00:01:46 | 00:01:48].
5.  It is recommended to copy this secret phrase onto physical paper rather than on a PC, as a PC is vulnerable to hacking [00:01:56 | 00:02:09].
6.  After copying the phrase, you will need to re-enter the words in the correct order as a verification process to confirm your wallet has been successfully created [00:02:10 | 00:02:22].

### Importing an Existing Wallet

If you already have a wallet, you can [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | import it]] by simply entering the words of your secret phrase in the correct order, followed by your password [00:01:05 | 00:01:13].

## Key Functionalities

Once your wallet is set up, you will see options for notifications and a list of accepted cryptocurrencies [00:02:27 | 00:02:34]. The main functionalities include [[buying_sending_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies_using_trust_wallet | sending, receiving, buying, and swapping]] cryptocurrencies [00:02:51 | 00:02:56].

### Receiving Cryptocurrencies

To receive cryptocurrencies, select the "Receive" option. The application will display your unique wallet address in both QR code format and alphanumeric form. It is important to note the specific blockchain (e.g., BNB Smart Chain for BNB) that the address accepts [00:03:04 | 00:03:22].

### Sending Cryptocurrencies

You can [[buying_sending_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies_using_trust_wallet | send cryptocurrencies]] from your Trust Wallet. Ensure you understand the process and the specific blockchains involved for different cryptocurrencies [00:02:59 | 00:03:02].

### Swapping Cryptocurrencies

The "Swap" function allows you to [[buying_sending_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies_using_trust_wallet | exchange one cryptocurrency for another]] [00:03:44 | 00:03:45]. Trust Wallet uses the best available market rate for these exchanges [00:03:52 | 00:03:57].

### Buying Cryptocurrencies

You can [[buying_sending_and_swapping_cryptocurrencies_using_trust_wallet | buy cryptocurrencies]] directly within Trust Wallet through third-party providers like Simplex [00:04:07 | 00:04:17]. This typically involves making a card payment on an external page [00:04:26 | 00:04:38].

## Settings and Preferences

The "Configuration" section offers various options for customizing your Trust Wallet experience [00:05:42 | 00:05:44]:

*   **Security**: Manage your wallet's security settings and change your password [00:05:44 | 00:05:46].
*   **Wallets**: View your main wallet and [[creating_and_importing_wallets_in_trust_wallet | add new wallets]] to manage multiple portfolios from the same device [00:05:57 | 00:06:04].

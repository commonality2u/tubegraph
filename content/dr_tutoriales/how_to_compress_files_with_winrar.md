Compressing files with WinRAR can make them weigh less, facilitating their transport and sending via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is particularly useful for email services like Gmail, which have a 25 megabyte attachment limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Compression allows for sending a greater number of files in a single email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Prerequisites: Installing WinRAR

To compress and decompress files, you will need [[downloading_and_installing_winrar | WinRAR]], a program that facilitates these processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

If you don't have WinRAR installed, you can easily download it:
1.  Access a trusted search engine, such as Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Search for "WinRAR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  The first search result typically allows you to [[downloading_and_installing_winrar | download WinRAR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
    *   *(Note: The process of downloading and installing WinRAR is omitted in the source, as the presenter already has it installed)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>.

## Compressing a File with WinRAR

Once WinRAR is installed on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>, you can proceed to compress files.

1.  **Check Original File Size**: Before compression, it's helpful to check the file's current size.
    *   Right-click the file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
    *   Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
    *   For example, a video file might initially weigh 55.6 megabytes, making it too large for direct transfer via email services like Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

2.  **Initiate Compression**:
    *   Right-click the file again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
    *   Look for an icon resembling a stack of books or an option that says "Add to file" (or "Add to archive") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Click this option to open the compression settings.

3.  **[[setting_up_file_compression_with_winrar | WinRAR Compression Settings]]**:
    *   **Archive Name**: Choose a name for your compressed file. The `.rar` extension indicates it's a compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Compression Method**: Select "Best" or "Best size" for maximum compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Dictionary Size**: Set this to the "least possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Divide into volumes**: Set this to "zero" unless you need to split the archive into multiple parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Compression Options**: Check "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Password**: You can optionally add a password to encrypt the compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. *(The presenter opts not to add a password in this example)* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Advanced**: In most cases, you won't need to touch anything in the advanced settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Note that some files, especially video files (like `kv` format), may not offer significant compression as they might already be highly optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

4.  **Complete Compression**:
    *   Click "OK" to start the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
    *   The process takes a few seconds, depending on the file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

5.  **Verify Compressed Size**:
    *   Once completed, right-click the newly created `.rar` file and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    *   The example video file, which was 55.6 MB, was compressed to 43.9 megabytes, representing approximately 20% compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

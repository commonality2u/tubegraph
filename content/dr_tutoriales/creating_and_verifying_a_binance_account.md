## Account Creation
For users who have not yet created a Binance account, it is recommended to refer to a previous video tutorial by the same creator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This earlier tutorial, which focuses on using Binance from a computer, details the process of creating an account and familiarizing oneself with the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Account Verification
The speaker's account is already verified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The process for verifying an account was taught in the aforementioned previous tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The mobile app also provides an option to verify the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

## Logging In
Once the [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_phone | Binance app]] is downloaded and opened on a mobile device (compatible with both iPhone and Android) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, users can proceed to log in. This involves clicking "Log in" at the top right, entering email and other data, and completing a security verification to confirm the user is not a robot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. A security code will then be sent to the registered mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

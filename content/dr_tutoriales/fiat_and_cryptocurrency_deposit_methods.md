This article compares the differences between the Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance platforms, focusing on which platform offers better value for buying cryptocurrencies or investing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Account Creation

All three platforms — Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance — offer free account creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. No fees are charged for simply having an account on any of these exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Depositing Fiat Currency

When it comes to [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | depositing fiat]] currency, there are significant differences in commissions:

### Coinbase
Coinbase charges a commission ranging from 1% to 4% for deposits, with the exact percentage varying based on the transfer method and origin, such as 3.99% for transfers from Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Coinbase Pro
Coinbase Pro is considerably more cost-effective for fiat deposits. For example, a SEPA transfer on Coinbase Pro costs 0.15 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Binance
Binance generally offers very competitive or zero commissions for [[understanding_deposit_methods_for_fiat_and_cryptocurrency_in_binance | fiat deposits]], particularly through bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

*   **Payment Methods and Fees** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>:
    *   Visa/MC credit or debit card: 1.8% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) bank transfer: 0 commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   iDeal: 1.3 euros commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   SWIFT transfers (for USD): 0 commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Faster Payments (for GBP): 0 commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

**Recommendation:** It is highly recommended to make [[how_to_deposit_money_into_binance_in_2025 | fiat deposits]] via bank transfer rather than credit/debit cards, as card payments incur significantly higher commissions (e.g., 1.8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Paying commissions reduces the capital available for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

> **Tip:** Consider using services like N26 Bank for international transfers to Binance, as they often do not charge commissions for these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. If your conventional bank charges fees for transfers to cryptocurrency exchanges, exploring alternative banking solutions like N26 could lead to substantial savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Furthermore, opening a Binance account using a referral link can offer up to a 10% saving on deposit commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Overall, Binance is considered the winning platform for deposits due to its lower or zero commission options, especially for bank transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

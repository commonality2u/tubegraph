This article outlines the process of [[converting_crypto_to_fiat_currency | converting cryptocurrency to fiat currency]] and subsequently withdrawing funds to a bank account or PayPal. The primary goal is to teach users how to [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_a_bank_account | transfer their crypto assets]] from a trading platform to a traditional bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Initial Steps and Requirements

Before withdrawing, it's essential to understand that cryptocurrencies like Polygon Matic are not legal tender and cannot be directly stored in traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. Therefore, the first crucial step is to [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | convert your cryptocurrency]] into fiat money (national or conventional currency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>, such as Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

### Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat

To [[selling_bitcoin_and_converting_to_other_cryptocurrencies | convert your cryptocurrencies]], navigate to the "operating and selling" section of the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

1.  **Search for the cryptocurrency**: For example, search for "Matic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
2.  **Select "Sell"**: Although the option might initially show "Buy", selecting it will present the option to "Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Specify Amount**: Choose to sell all or a specific amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. The system will display the wallet balance in Euros and the [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | associated commission fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Commission Fees
> Be aware of [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commission fees]] during conversion. For instance, selling 2.76 Matic might incur a 1 Euro fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. For lower [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_conversion | commissions]], consider exploring alternative platforms like Combis Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

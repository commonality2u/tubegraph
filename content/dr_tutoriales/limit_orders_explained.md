Limit orders are a fundamental type of order within the [[KuCoin order types|KuCoin platform]] that allow users to strategically execute buy and sell orders at specific prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. They significantly simplify the process of making planned purchases and sales in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

## Placing a Limit Order

A limit order allows users to set a desired price and quantity for a transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. The quantity can be specified in either the base currency (e.g., KCS) or the quote currency (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

The core function of a limit order is to set a predetermined value at which the order will be executed once the real market price reaches that set value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

### Limit Buy Order

To place a [[cryptocurrency_market_orders_vs_limit_orders|limit buy order]], you anticipate that the price of a cryptocurrency will decrease to a certain point before rising again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. For example, if you believe KCS will drop to 9.984 USDT before increasing, you can set a limit order to buy at that price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. The order is placed and will execute if and when the market price reaches the specified buy price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>.

### Limit Sell Order

Conversely, a [[cryptocurrency_market_orders_vs_limit_orders|limit sell order]] is used when you expect the price to rise to a certain resistance level before potentially falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>. For instance, if you anticipate KCS reaching 11.187 USDT, you can place a limit order to sell your KCS at that price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. The order will be successfully placed and will await the market price reaching your set sell price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>.

## Managing Open Limit Orders

All active limit orders are visible in the "open orders" section of the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. This section displays details such as the order placement time, the trading pair (e.g., KCS/USDT), the type of order (e.g., limit sell), the set price, and the quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

You have the flexibility to cancel an open limit order at any time, even if a percentage of it has already been executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This ensures that you maintain control over your trades.

## Comparison to Market Orders

Unlike [[market_orders_in_trading|market orders in trading]], which execute instantly at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>, limit orders give you control over the execution price. This is crucial for strategic trading where you want to buy low or sell high at specific, predefined levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

*   **[[Market orders in trading|Market Orders]]**: Execute immediately at the best available current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Limit Orders**: Execute only when the market price reaches your specified limit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

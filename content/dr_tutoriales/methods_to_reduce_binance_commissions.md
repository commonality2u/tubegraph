This article outlines five main types of transactions where commissions are charged and how to reduce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Deposit Commissions

[[How to deposit money into Binance | Deposits]] can be made in both fiat currency and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Fiat Deposits
When depositing national currencies (e.g., Euro, Dollar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, [[Binance]] offers various [[methods_for_reducing_deposit_fees_on_binance | methods]], including bank transfer, banking card, Ideal, and wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. [[Commission fees for cryptocurrency transactions | Commissions]] vary by method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The recommended [[methods_for_reducing_deposit_fees_on_binance | method]] for lowest [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commission]] is bank transfer, along with AFAS wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Due to Brexit, transfers from Europe to [[Binance]] (now based in the UK) may incur bank commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

**Solution for Zero Fiat Deposit Commissions:**
To avoid these bank commissions, it is recommended to create an account with N26 Bank, a digital bank that allows transactions to countries outside the European Union (like the UK) with zero commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Fiat deposits using bank transfers may take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Deposits
[[How to deposit money into Binance | Cryptocurrencies]] can be deposited from other accounts, such as Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. [[Binance]] does not charge any [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commission]] for receiving cryptocurrencies from another account or wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. The commissions for receiving cryptocurrencies depend on the platform from which they are sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## Internal Transfers

Internal transfers within your [[Binance]] account, such as moving funds from a spot wallet to a futures wallet, are free of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

## Trading Operations (Buy/Sell)

[[Binance commission structure | Commission fees]] for buying and selling cryptocurrencies are influenced by VIP levels and the use of BNB.

### VIP Levels
[[Binance]] has a [[binance_commission_structure | VIP level system]] (VIP zero to VIP nine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Higher VIP levels result in lower [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. VIP levels are determined by the volume of trading (e.g., Bitcoin) and the balance held in flexible savings (not locked savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For example, VIP zero pays 0.1% [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commissions]], while VIP one pays 0.09% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Using BNB for Discounts
[[Using discounts on Binance to save on transaction fees | Users can receive a 25% discount on trading commissions by paying them with BNB (Binance Coin)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This means a 0.1% commission is reduced to 0.075% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. To utilize this discount, users must have BNB in their spot wallet (not locked savings) and enable the option to pay commissions with BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. BNB is a cryptocurrency designed to reduce commissions and improve user experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Binance Visa Card

Using the [[Binance]] Visa card can result in cashback (refunds) on purchases, with the percentage depending on the amount of BNB held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. For example, holding 10 BNB can yield a 2% refund on payments made with the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## Withdrawals

[[Commission fees for cryptocurrency transactions | Commissions]] are charged for withdrawals of both fiat money and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

### Fiat Withdrawals
For fiat withdrawals, [[Binance]] offers bank transfer and Visa card options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. A bank transfer may incur an 0.8% commission on Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

**Solution for Zero Fiat Withdrawal Commissions:**
Similar to deposits, using N26 Bank is recommended for fiat withdrawals to avoid commissions when transferring money to a Spanish bank, as [[Binance]] transfers originate from the UK <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. While bank card withdrawals are faster, bank transfers are recommended for greater commission savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Withdrawals
When transferring cryptocurrencies to another account or cold wallet, [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | commissions]] depend on the network used for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. For example, a Bitcoin withdrawal might cost 30 cents, while a BNB chain withdrawal might cost 0.07 BNB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. These withdrawal commissions cannot currently be reduced, except potentially through [[benefits_of_using_binance_referral_links | referral links]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

The Binance Futures application on a mobile device allows users to engage in trading with or without leverage at any time and from any location, provided they have a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

This discount can help save on cryptocurrency costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Accessing Binance Futures on Mobile

To begin, open the [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_device | Binance application]] on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Within the bottom menu, locate and select the "Futures" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This guide assumes you already have a futures account open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. If not, a separate tutorial is available on [[how_to_open_a_futures_account | how to open a futures account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Understanding Futures Sections

Within the Futures option, you will find different sections: USDM, CoinM, and Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This tutorial focuses on the USDM section, which is the primary area for futures operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **USDM**: This is the main section where you will operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Here, you can filter for various assets or search for specific ones like IOTA USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   **CoinM**: In CoinM, you will find other assets compared to the dollar, such as Bitcoin US Permanent or Quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This section is not covered in detail in this tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Transferring Funds to Futures Wallet

Before operating, you need to [[transferring_funds_to_futures_wallet | transfer money from your main account to your futures account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

1.  Navigate to "Wallet" within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Futures" section of your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Select the "Transfer" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Avoid "Loan" or "Repayment" options due to associated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
4.  Transfer your capital from your Spot wallet to your Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
5.  Funds must be transferred in USD, as this is the asset used for trading against cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin USD or Ethereum USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
6.  You can select the amount to transfer and confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The transferred amount will be reflected in your USD balance in the Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Margin Mode: Cross vs. Isolated

A crucial setting to modify is the margin mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. You can choose between "Cross" and "Isolated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Cross Mode**: In cross mode, all orders under the same asset share the same asset balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If a position is liquidated, your assets in other wallets can be used to cover losses, meaning you could lose more than what's in your futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Isolated Mode**: The margin assigned to a position is restricted to a specific amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. If this amount is exceeded, only that specific position is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This limits the risk of losing more money than you have in your futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

It is recommended to work in "Isolated" mode to manage risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. After selecting, click "Confirm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Adjusting Leverage

Next to the margin mode, you can adjust the leverage, from 1x up to 75x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Higher leverage can increase potential profits but also significantly increases risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. The maximum position size changes with the chosen leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Placing Orders

You can choose between different order types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. A separate tutorial is available for understanding various order types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

### Market Order Example

A market order is the simplest type, executing immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

1.  Select "Market" as the order type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
2.  Choose whether to "Buy" or "Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount of XRP (or chosen asset) you wish to buy or sell, or use the slider to set a percentage based on your available USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
4.  The app will display the cost in USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
5.  Minimum quantity restrictions may apply (e.g., cannot buy less than 5 XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
6.  Once you have sufficient funds and meet minimums, confirming the order will execute the purchase or sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

## Managing Positions

After placing an order, if it's executed, your open position will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

*   **PNL (Profit and Loss)**: This indicator shows whether your operation is currently in a positive or negative state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Leverage**: You can modify the leverage for an open position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Closing Operations**: To close an operation, you can place a sell order for the existing quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. You can also use the "Close All" option for residual values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Order History**: You can view your order history to see completed orders, both buys and sells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Recommendations and Warnings

*   Always be clear on the prices and values you intend to operate with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.
*   The market is volatile, and it's essential to be very attentive to price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Exercise extreme caution with leverage due to the high risks involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   It is generally recommended to work from a computer for complex operations, and only use the mobile phone if you have a clear understanding of the operations to be carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

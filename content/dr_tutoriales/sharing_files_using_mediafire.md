While you can upload files if you already have an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, this guide covers [[creating_a_mediafire_account | creating a new account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

To [[creating_a_mediafire_account | create an account]], click "Sign up" in the top right corner of the Mediafire page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Mediafire offers various plans for its users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The basic, free account provides a maximum of 10 gigabytes of cloud storage for files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. It is possible to expand this storage to up to 50 GB for basic accounts through a guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. To proceed with the basic account, select "Get Basic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> and fill in the required personal details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## [[how_to_manage_files_and_folders_on_mediafire | Managing Files and Folders]]

Upon creating an account, you will see your folders on the Mediafire platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The main panel allows you to "Upload" (or "subir" in Spanish) files and filter them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Mediafire also provides the option to [[how_to_manage_files_and_folders_on_mediafire | create folders]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. For example, you can create a folder named "YouTube Tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, which initially contains no sub-folders or files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## [[how_to_upload_files_to_mediafire | Uploading Files]]

To [[how_to_upload_files_to_mediafire | upload files]] to Mediafire:

2.  Click "Upload" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  Choose the file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, such as a PNG image file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
4.  Click "Begin Upload" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The file will be added to the queue and begin uploading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Once complete, you can close the upload window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Upload Options
> The upload option also allows you to upload entire folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, which is useful for uploading multiple files at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Uploading websites, however, is a feature exclusive to premium users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Sharing Files

After uploading a file, such as "uploading files to mediafire.png" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, you can obtain a link to share it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>:
1.  Click the three dots next to the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
2.  Select "Copy link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is the most common and useful method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
3.  Once copied, anyone with the link can paste it into a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a> and download the file from Mediafire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This is a very useful way to share files with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

Alternatively, selecting the "Share" option will open a different menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. From here, you can still get the link, but you can also modify who shares the link or set it for single sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This menu offers options like direct download links for images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

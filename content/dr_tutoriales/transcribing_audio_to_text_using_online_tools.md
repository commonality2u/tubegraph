Transcribing audio to text can be a very easy process using online tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article focuses on methods that can be done directly within web browsers, specifically Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Online Transcription Tools

Online transcription involves using web-based services that convert spoken words into written text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Many different online translators and transcription services exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Free vs. Paid Services

A key distinction among these tools is whether they are free or require payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   **Free Tools**: The video focuses on demonstrating two specific tools that are "absolutely free of charge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. These free tools are designed for simple and quick transcriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. They typically have limitations, such as not being suitable for transcribing long content like a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Paid Services**: Many other online transcription services are paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. These services often provide free trials, but continuous or extensive use requires a subscription or payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This is because such services often require significant computational power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Examples mentioned include:
    *   **Happy Scribe**: Allows users to "get started for free" but has pricing tiers based on minutes or words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   **Speech Text AI**: Charges around ten dollars a month for 180 minutes of transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
    *   **Open AI**: A paid service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
    *   **Bizz**: Also has limitations, such as providing only 30 minutes of free subtitles before requiring payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Quality Difference**: Paid platforms generally offer "a lot elder" (higher) quality of transcription compared to free tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## How to Transcribe Audio with Online Tools

The process for [[transcribing_audio_from_mobile_devices | transcribing audio]] using the free online tools demonstrated is straightforward:

1.  **Access the Tool**: Navigate to the online voice-to-text and transcription service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Prepare Audio**: Ensure your audio file is ready. An example shown is an audio recorded from a mobile phone via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
3.  **Import Audio**: Import the audio file directly into the online tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
4.  **Select Transcription Option**: Click on the "transcribe audio or video" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
5.  **Choose Document**: Select the desired audio file, such as a WhatsApp audio recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
6.  **Set Speed**: Adjust the playback speed of the audio. It is recommended to set a normal speed, as a very fast speed can lead to inaccurate transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
7.  **Play and Observe**: Play the audio and observe the transcription as it is generated on the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Transcription Quality and Accuracy

The free tools can achieve a "reliable" transcription, often around "eighty percent, ninety percent of the Successful words" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. However, they are not perfect and can make mistakes, especially with certain phrases or if the audio speed is too fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. For instance, an example showed an error in transcribing "mother who gave birth to you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. These free tools are best suited for simple, short audio files rather than complex or lengthy recordings like a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For higher accuracy and more professional results, paid services are recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

By default, YouTube channels do not permit [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | uploading videos]] with a duration greater than fifteen minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. If an attempt is made to upload a longer video without this feature enabled, YouTube will block the video, often stopping processing at 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This is not a YouTube error, but rather a specific permission that needs to be enabled for newer channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Enabling Long Video Uploads

To gain the ability to [[how_to_upload_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos longer than 15 minutes]], you must enable this specific permission through [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Accessing YouTube Studio Settings

1.  **Navigate to YouTube Studio**: Begin by going to [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] for the channel you wish to configure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Switch to Classic Version**: For faster access to the necessary settings, switch to the classic version of [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
3.  **Go to Channel Settings**: Once in the classic version, click on the "Channel" option located in the left-hand panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This section displays various options and permissions currently active for your channel, such as upload capabilities, monetization, and direct broadcasting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Verifying Account for Longer Videos

Within the Channel settings, locate the section related to "longer duration videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Normally, a channel without this feature enabled will show "No" indicating it is not allowed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

To enable [[requirements_for_uploading_longer_videos_on_youtube | longer video uploads]], you will need to verify your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | verification process]] confirms that the YouTube account corresponds to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

*   **Verification Method**: YouTube will send a confirmation code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. This code can be sent to your mobile phone, Gmail, or another associated email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Completing Verification**: Once you receive the confirmation code, use it to complete the verification process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

After successful verification, the option for [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | longer video uploads]] will be enabled, allowing you to upload videos exceeding fifteen minutes without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

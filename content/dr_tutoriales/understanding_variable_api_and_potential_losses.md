Decentralized Finance (DeFi) offers the potential for high profitability with cryptocurrencies, but it also carries significant risks due to its variable nature and exposure to contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While many believe DeFi represents the future of finance, it is not considered a very safe product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## What is DeFi?

DeFi is inspired by blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin's underlying system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This technology allows multiple entities to hold copies of transactions, meaning it is not controlled by a single central source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Understanding Variable APY

One of the key characteristics of DeFi investments is the variable Annual Percentage Yield (APY) or annual return.
*   The APY is not a fixed value; it adjusts daily based on chain rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   While annual returns can sometimes exceed 30% or even 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, profitability is not always positive and can even be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. This means the return is a variable term, not a fixed one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

For example, a current available cryptocurrency DeFi product might offer an 8.79% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, it's essential to analyze whether this profitability is comparable to or better than other products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Potential Losses and Risks

Investing in DeFi products exposes users to high risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Contract Vulnerability**: Platforms like Binance act solely as service platforms and do not guarantee that projects will always function as expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. They are not responsible for losses incurred due to the vulnerability of a project's smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Project Disappearance**: Some projects have disappeared due to contract vulnerabilities, leading to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Examples include "Pizza" cryptocurrencies where projects failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> It is crucial to be aware that DeFi projects do not always work, and the platform does not guarantee this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

## Importance of Due Diligence

Given the inherent risks, it is vital to [[importance_of_analyzing_defi_projects | analyze DeFi projects]] thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Before investing:
*   **Research the Project**: Inform yourself about the specific project and cryptocurrency you are considering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Returns**: Analyze the returns offered and understand that they are variable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Understand Terms**: Read and accept the agreement of the DeFi product, informing yourself about its terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> It is recommended to start with a small amount of capital to gain experience with DeFi products before committing larger sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Checking Your Investment and Profitability

To view your DeFi investment and cumulative profitability:
1.  Navigate to the 'Wallet' section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
2.  Go to the 'Earn' section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
3.  Select the 'DeFi' product category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
4.  You can then view either your flexible or locked DeFi investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This allows you to track the cumulative profitability and see how much you have earned at any given time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

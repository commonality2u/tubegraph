This tutorial explains how to set up dark mode within the Facebook application on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This process works for both iPhone and Android devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Preparation: Update the Facebook App

Before beginning, ensure you have the Facebook application downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. It is crucial that the app is updated to its latest version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
To do this:
1.  Go to your device's App Store (or Google Play Store) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  Search for "Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
3.  Tap "Update" if an update is available. If it's already updated to the maximum, tap "Open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Steps to Activate Dark Mode

1.  Once the Facebook app is open, navigate to the three horizontal lines located on the right side of the bottom menu bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
2.  Within the "Settings & Privacy" section, locate the "Dark Mode" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It is represented by a moon icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
3.  Tap on "Dark Mode" to reveal three options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Dark Mode Options

There are three settings available for Facebook's dark mode:

### System

*   This option is selected by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   When "System" is chosen, Facebook will automatically adjust its appearance based on your mobile device's system-wide dark mode settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   For example, if your phone's system is set to dark mode, Facebook will appear in dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. If your phone is in light mode (white mode), Facebook will also revert to light mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Deactivated

*   Selecting "Deactivated" will set Facebook to light mode (white background), regardless of your phone's system settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Activated

*   Choosing "Activated" will force Facebook into dark mode, even if your mobile device's system settings are set to light mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This ensures Facebook always appears in dark mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Note on Dark Mode Appearance

It's important to note that Facebook's dark mode is not a pure black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Instead, it displays a shade of dark gray, which is slightly lighter than true black <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

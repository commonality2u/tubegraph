This article provides a guide on how to use Google Calendar, including navigation, creating new calendars, sharing options, and event management.

## Accessing Google Calendar
To access Google Calendar, open a new tab in your web browser. Then, navigate to the Google applications icon (represented by "little squares") located on the top right of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. From there, select "schedule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, which will open Google Calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Viewing Options
Google Calendar allows you to set the view based on day, week, month, or year, using options found on the right side of the interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The month view is often recommended as it is considered the most visual way to organize your schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The days of the month are also visible on the left side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

You might see holidays, such as those from Spain, displayed in green <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If your calendar becomes too busy, these holiday displays can be hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## [[creating_a_new_google_calendar|Creating a New Google Calendar]]
To [[creating_a_new_google_calendar|create a new calendar]], go to "other calendars" and click the "more" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Then, select "Create a calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

When creating a new calendar:
*   You can assign a name, such as "video YouTube tutorials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   Add a description, like "best YouTube tutorials" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   The owner of the calendar is automatically set to your email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Once created, the new calendar will appear on the left side of your main Google Calendar interface, alongside your other calendars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The creation and synchronization process typically takes several seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Configuring a Calendar
After [[creating_a_new_google_calendar|creating a new calendar]], you can configure its settings. To do this, click the three dots next to the calendar's name on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

You can change the calendar's color for better visual organization. For example, if "reminders" and your "personal calendar" are already blue, you might choose red for a new calendar like "YouTube video tutorial" to make it distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## [[sharing_google_calendar_with_others|Sharing Google Calendar with Others]]
To [[sharing_google_calendar_with_others|share your calendar]], go to the calendar's settings and select "configure and share" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

You have two primary options for [[making_a_google_calendar_public_or_private|making a Google Calendar public or private]]:

### Sharing with Specific People (Private)
If you want to share your calendar with only certain individuals, select "share with certain people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Click "add people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   Enter the email addresses of the people you want to add <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   You can assign different permissions to these individuals, such as allowing them to:
    *   See all events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   Make changes to events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Have administrator privileges to manage the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Sharing Publicly
To [[making_a_google_calendar_public_or_private|make your calendar public]] so that anyone can access it, select the option to "share it publicly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This option is suitable for calendars meant for subscribers or for sending general reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Sharing with Non-Gmail Accounts
If you need to share your calendar with people who do not have a Gmail account, you have two main options:
1.  **Share it publicly**: As mentioned above, a public calendar can be seen by anyone, regardless of their email provider (e.g., Yahoo, Photomail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Suggest creating a Gmail account**: Alternatively, the individual can create a Gmail account, which is a simple process taking less than five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Once they have a Gmail account, you can then share the calendar with them privately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## [[configuring_notifications_and_events_in_google_calendar|Configuring Notifications and Events]]
In addition to sharing, you can [[configuring_notifications_and_events_in_google_calendar|configure notifications]] for your calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
*   You can add notifications to alert you about events with a specified lead time, such as ten minutes, ten hours, or four hours in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   You can also configure notifications for other types of events, including canceled events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. These notifications are useful for organizing your daily schedule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Adding an Event
To add an event to your calendar:
1.  Click on the desired date (e.g., April 23rd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  Select "add an event" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  Enter a title for the event, such as "video calendar tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
4.  You can optionally add guests, location, and conference details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
5.  Add a description, like "a good tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
6.  Assign the event to the appropriate calendar (e.g., "YouTube video tutorials" calendar, which might appear in red) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
7.  Save the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Once an event is added to a shared calendar, a notification can be sent to both email and mobile devices, depending on how it's configured, to inform users about the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

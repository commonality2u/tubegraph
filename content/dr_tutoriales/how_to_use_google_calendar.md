Google Calendar is a tool for organizing events and sharing schedules with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Accessing Google Calendar

To access Google Calendar, open a new tab in your web browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Navigate to the Google applications icon (represented by "little squares") located on the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, and then select "Calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

### Calendar Views

You can set the calendar to display by day, week, month, or year using the options on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The "month" view is often recommended for its visual clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Additionally, days of the month are listed on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

Pre-populated holidays (such as those for Spain) may appear on the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If the calendar becomes too busy, these can be hidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## [[creating_a_new_calendar_in_google_calendar | Creating a New Calendar]]

To [[creating_a_new_calendar_in_google_calendar | create a new calendar]]:
1.  Go to "other calendars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Click the "more" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  Select "Create a calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

When creating a calendar, you will define its name (e.g., "video YouTube tutorials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> and provide a description (e.g., "best YouTube tutorials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The owner's email will be automatically associated with the calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. The creation process takes a few seconds as it needs to synchronize with Google Calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Once created, the new calendar will appear on the left side of the main screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Customizing Calendar Appearance

You can customize the color of your calendar to distinguish it from others, such as personal calendars or reminders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. For example, a calendar for YouTube tutorials might be set to red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. To change the color, click the three dots next to the calendar name on the left and select the desired color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Sharing Options

There are two primary ways to share a calendar:

    1.  Go to "Share with certain people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    2.  Click "Add people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Sharing with Non-Gmail Accounts

If you need to share a calendar with individuals who do not have a Gmail account, you have two options:
1.  **Share it publicly**: As mentioned above, this allows anyone to view the calendar, regardless of their email provider (e.g., Yahoo, Hotmail) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Request a Gmail account creation**: The person can create a simple Gmail account in less than five minutes to allow for private sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

## [[configuring_calendar_notifications | Configuring Calendar Notifications]]

In addition to sharing, you can [[configuring_calendar_notifications | configure notifications]] for events. This allows the calendar to send alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. You can add notifications for events with a chosen lead time (e.g., ten minutes, ten hours, four hours in advance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Other types of notifications, such as for canceled events, can also be configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. These notifications are useful for daily organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Adding an Event

To add an event to your calendar:
1.  Click on the desired date on the calendar (e.g., April 23rd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
2.  A window will appear where you can add an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  **Add a title**: For example, "video calendar tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
4.  **Add guests**: If applicable, although not necessary for all events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
5.  **Add location and conferences**: Specify a location, like "Madrid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
6.  **Add a description**: Such as "a good tutorial" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
7.  **Select the calendar**: Choose which calendar the event belongs to (e.g., "YouTube video tutorials") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
8.  **Save** the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

Once an event is saved on a shared calendar, other users with access can utilize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Notifications for the event can be sent to email or mobile devices, depending on how they are configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

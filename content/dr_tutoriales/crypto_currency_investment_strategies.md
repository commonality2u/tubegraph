BNB Vault (also known as BNB Bolt or BNB Trunk) is a financial product available on the Binance platform designed to generate returns by [[cryptocurrency_investment_strategies_with_binance_savings | investing]] the native BNB currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It allows users to obtain significant profitability by yielding other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Key Features and Benefits of BNB Vault

*   **BNB-Exclusive Investment** The BNB Vault specifically allows [[investing_with_bnb_vs_bitcoin | investment]] only of the BNB cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, Ethereum, or Polkadot cannot be invested directly into the BNB Vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
*   **Multiple Profit Streams** When BNB is invested in the BNB Vault, it generates rewards from multiple sources:
    *   **Launchpool Rewards:** The BNB Vault provides rewards based on what is available in the Launchpool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Launchpool is a tool that allows users to generate cryptocurrencies by using others as reference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>, such as obtaining "Everything" or "Litentry" cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   **Savings Rewards:** In addition to Launchpool rewards, investing in BNB Vault also provides rewards from savings (i.e., BNB currency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This means users are effectively re-investing to earn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
    *   **Random Rewards:** The platform periodically releases programs that offer random rewards and other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Flexible Savings** BNB Vault offers flexible savings, meaning users can withdraw their invested BNB whenever they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. It is not subject to locked [[risks_and_profitability_of_cryptocurrency_staking | staking]] periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Automatic Transfer Option

BNB Vault offers an automatic transfer feature that allows users to automatically transfer available BNB balances from their spot accounts to BNB Vault daily at 1:00 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This feature can be activated or deactivated as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## BNB Vault vs. Launchpool

While both BNB Vault and Launchpool allow users to generate cryptocurrencies, BNB Vault offers superior benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>:
*   **Launchpool:** Only provides the specific cryptocurrencies offered by the Launchpool system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For example, it might offer a 5% annual return in "Everything" and 3.76% in "Litentry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
*   **BNB Vault:** Provides rewards from both the Launchpool *and* additional savings rewards, leading to more overall crypto coins and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Therefore, investing BNB in the BNB Vault yields more benefits compared to investing directly in the Launchpool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Recommendations for Investment

It is recommended to invest BNB in the BNB Vault due to its flexibility and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. It is a secure and flexible savings option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

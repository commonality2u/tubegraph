This guide provides a tutorial on [[how_to_unlock_keyboard_on_windows_10 | how to block and unlock your computer keyboard]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is particularly useful if your keyboard has been locked by accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This method works for Windows 7, 8, and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## How to Block Your Keyboard

Initially, your keyboard should be functioning normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. To block it:

1.  Locate the Shift key, which is typically found below the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  Press and hold the Shift key for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
3.  After holding it, the computer will emit a sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> and a screen will appear asking if you want to turn on the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] for Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
4.  By default, the "Yes" option is often selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, and users may unintentionally press it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
5.  If you select "Yes", your keyboard will stop working <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Holding the Shift key for an extended period activates the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Windows Filter Keys]] feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. These [[windows_filter_keys_feature | filters]] are designed to block your keyboard on Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## How to Unlock Your Keyboard

If your keyboard has been blocked by the [[windows_filter_keys_feature | Filter Keys]] feature, you can unlock it by following these steps:

1.  Press and hold the Shift key again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  Keep the Shift key pressed for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
3.  The computer will sound again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and your keyboard functionality will be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

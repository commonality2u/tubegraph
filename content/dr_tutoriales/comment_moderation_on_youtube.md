Activating and managing comments on YouTube videos is crucial for fostering audience engagement and promoting content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Greater interaction, even through negative comments, helps position videos favorably within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Activating Comments

To [[activating_comments_on_youtube_videos | activate comments]] on your YouTube videos, navigate to the YouTube Studio for your channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. There are three primary considerations to enable comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:

### 1. Channel Configuration

First, go to "Configuration" within YouTube Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
Under "Channel," access the "Advanced settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
Ensure your channel is marked as "not a channel created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. If it's designated for children, comments will be automatically banned on all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### 2. Video-Specific Settings

Next, go to the specific video you wish to manage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
Click on "Details" (often part of [[editing_video_details_after_uploading_to_youtube | editing video details]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
Similar to channel settings, confirm that the video is *not* marked as "content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. YouTube will block comments if this option is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### 3. Comment Permissions within Video Details

Within the video's details, scroll down to "More options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
Find the "Comments and ratings" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
Select "Allow all comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Options may include disabling comments or preventing them from being read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Choosing "Allow all comments" ensures interaction on your videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Moderating Comments

Once comments are activated, you can allow all comments to appear and then moderate them as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. You will receive notifications for new comments and can delete those that are inappropriate, disrespectful, or disrupt the video's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Google Calendar allows you to set the view based on day, week, month, or year using the options on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The month view is often recommended for its visual clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The days of the month are also displayed on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Understanding P2P Payments

Peer-to-peer (P2P) payments, also known as person-to-person payments, are essentially a [[currency_exchange_through_p2p | currency exchange]] between different users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. [[using_p2p_trading_for_currency_conversion | Using P2P trading for currency conversion]] can often be more profitable than exchanging currency within a traditional bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. This article focuses on aspects of [[conducting_p2p_transactions_on_binance | conducting P2P transactions on Binance]], specifically user ratings and security considerations.

## Key Considerations for P2P Transactions

When engaging in [[peer_to_peer_payments_tutorial | P2P payments]], several factors should be taken into account:

*   **Price and Commission Graphs**: It is important to consider the price and commission that will be charged for the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Always check the graphs before purchasing through the P2P method, as prices can vary significantly from the market rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. For instance, a Bitcoin might be offered for 36,000 euros via P2P when the market price is around 27,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Volatility**: Cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin are highly volatile, meaning their value can change significantly from one day to the next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Constant attention to these fluctuations is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **[[Payment methods for cryptocurrency transactions | Payment Methods]]**: Not all users are willing to use the same payment method, which can depend on country-specific conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The most commonly used methods include bank transfers and PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet Management**: To trade in P2P, capital must be transferred to the P2P wallet from other wallets within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.

## User Ratings and Transaction Security

A crucial aspect of P2P transactions is the rating of each user, which indicates how many P2P transactions they have conducted and how many were satisfactorily completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Understanding User Ratings

*   **Valuation System**: After completing a P2P transaction, users can rate each other based on speed, ease, and whether payment was received correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.
*   **Displayed Information**: Below a user's name, you can typically see the number of orders they have placed and the percentage of those orders that have been completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. For example, a user might have 52 orders with a 96.30% completion rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
*   **Interpreting Completion Rates**: A high completion rate doesn't necessarily mean the remaining percentage failed; it could indicate that those transactions are still pending payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Reviewing**: Before engaging in a transaction, it is imperative to take into account the number of orders a user has made and their percentage of completed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Managing Transaction Risks

*   **Risk of Non-Payment**: There is a risk that a counterparty may not pay, and each individual assumes this risk when performing P2P payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.
*   **Choosing Reliable Counterparties**: Selecting users with high completion rates and a significant number of orders can help mitigate the risk of issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

By carefully evaluating user ratings, understanding market prices, and being mindful of transaction risks, users can more securely engage in P2P cryptocurrency exchanges.

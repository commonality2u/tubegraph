<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a> Other videos on Binance savings and profitability are available in a dedicated playlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Accessing Binance Savings
To access the savings options, navigate to the "Finance" section on the Binance Exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Within "Finance," select "Earn," which compiles all programs designed to yield profitability from cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

Under "Earn," you will find options for:
*   Flexible Terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   Fixed Terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   High-risk products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

The two main terms explained are [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] and Locked Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Clicking on [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] will lead to a page with three primary options: [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]], Locked Savings, and Activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Understanding Flexible vs. Locked Savings
Both [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] and Locked Savings involve providing a cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) to receive an annual profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. For example, Bitcoin might offer an annual profitability of 1.20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Flexible Savings
[[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] allow you to deposit and withdraw your cryptocurrency whenever you wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. The interest rate for [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] is more or less fixed, though it can vary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The key advantage is the ability to withdraw funds at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Locked Savings
Locked Savings, as the name suggests, involve depositing a cryptocurrency for a specific number of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
You can choose the duration of the deposit, such as:
*   7 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   14 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
*   30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>
*   90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>

The interest rate or profitability varies based on the chosen duration, with longer durations generally offering higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This is because providing the platform with more time for your asset allows for greater profitability through commissions or liquidity provision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Key Differences & Recommendations
*   **Withdrawal:** [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] allow withdrawal at any time; Locked Savings do not allow withdrawal until the term ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Returns:** [[flexible_savings_and_investment_options_in_binance | Flexible Savings]] generally offer lower returns compared to Locked Savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

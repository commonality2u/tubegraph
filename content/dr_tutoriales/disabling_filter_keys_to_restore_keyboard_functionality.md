This article explains how to [[keyboard_blocking_and_unlocking_in_windows_versions | block and unlock]] your computer's keyboard, specifically focusing on how to [[how_to_unlock_the_keyboard_in_windows_10 | unlock the keyboard]] if it has been accidentally locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tutorial is applicable for Windows 7, 8, and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## What are Filter Keys?

[[using_windows_filter_keys_to_lock_the_keyboard | Windows Filter Keys]] are an accessibility feature designed to ignore brief or repeated keystrokes, which can be useful for users with certain motor impairments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When activated, these filters effectively block the keyboard, preventing input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Enabling Filter Keys (and Locking the Keyboard)

Filter Keys can be activated unintentionally, leading to a locked keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

To accidentally activate them:
1.  Hold down the Shift key (located underneath the Enter key) for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
2.  Your computer will emit a sound, and a screen will appear asking if you want to turn on Filter Keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
3.  The "Yes" option appears by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If this option is pressed unintentionally, the keyboard will become non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Restoring Keyboard Functionality

If your keyboard has been locked due to the activation of Filter Keys, you can restore its functionality by deactivating them:
1.  Press and hold the Shift key again for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  The computer will make a sound again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
3.  Keyboard functionality will be restored, allowing you to type freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Paid services often provide higher transcription quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Process for Transcribing Mobile Audio

To transcribe audio recorded on a mobile device, follow these steps:

1.  **Record and Transfer Audio:** Record the desired audio on your mobile device (e.g., via WhatsApp) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Then, download the audio file to your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
2.  **Access Online Tool:** Navigate to an online [[transcribing_audio_to_text_using_online_tools | transcription service]] in your web browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
3.  **Import Audio:** Import the downloaded audio file into the online transcription tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Look for an option like "transcribe audio or video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
4.  **Set Playback Speed:** It's recommended to set the playback speed to "normal" to ensure accurate transcription <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Transcribing at a very fast speed can lead to errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
5.  **Play and Observe:** Play the audio within the tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The transcription will appear on the screen as the audio plays <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
6.  **Review Accuracy:** Online tools typically achieve about 80-90% accuracy in transcribing words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. You may need to manually correct any mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

While these free tools are effective for general use, they are not suitable for transcribing very long audios like an entire movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For higher-level, professional transcription, using paid services is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

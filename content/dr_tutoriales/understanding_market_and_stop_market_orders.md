This article provides an overview of market and stop market orders available on the [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | KuCoin]] trading platform, explaining how they function for strategic buying and selling of cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. These order types can significantly simplify [[strategic_buying_and_selling_in_cryptocurrency_markets | strategic buying and selling]] within the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Accessing Trading Orders

To access the different order types on KuCoin, navigate to the "commercial" and "spot valet market" section on the computer platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The order placement interface, located at the bottom of the trading screen, allows users to place buy/sell orders, including market, limit, stop-limit, and stop market orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Market Order

A market order is executed in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This order type allows users to buy or sell a cryptocurrency at its current market value the exact moment the order is placed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For example, if KCS is trading at 10.687 USDT, a market order to buy or sell will be executed at that prevailing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The price may fluctuate slightly between clicking and execution, but the transaction occurs at the exact price at that specific moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Stop Market Order

The stop market order follows a concept similar to a stop-limit order but with a key difference: the execution happens at the market price once triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Instead of setting a specific limit price for purchase or sale, a stop market order triggers a market order when a predetermined "stop price" is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

### How it Works

*   **Stop Price**: You set a stop price. When the cryptocurrency's price reaches this point, a market order is activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Execution**: Once the stop price is hit, the market order begins to execute. It may not fill 100% immediately but will progressively execute as the price moves towards or beyond the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Partial Execution**: If the market does not follow the expected pattern after the stop price is hit (e.g., price reaches stop but then reverses), only a percentage of the order might be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The order is fully executed only when the price reaches the defined stop price and continues in the expected direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Risk Reduction

This order type is crucial for reducing risk in trading operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. It ensures that if the price doesn't follow your anticipated pattern, you won't lose all the capital placed in the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

### Managing Stop Market Orders

Open stop market orders can be viewed in the "stop orders" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Users have the flexibility to cancel an order, even if it has been partially executed (e.g., 10-90% filled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.

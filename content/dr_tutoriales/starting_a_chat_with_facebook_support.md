[[contacting_facebook_support | Contacting Facebook support]] can be a complex process, but it is achievable with careful attention to the steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide outlines how to initiate a chat with Facebook support.

## Initial Navigation to Support

Directly accessing the general [[facebook_business_help_service | Facebook Business Help Service]] often leads to FAQs rather than direct support contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. To proceed with direct contact, you must navigate to the help service specifically for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

*   If you do not have a business account, you can quickly create one using your existing Facebook profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Accessing the Business Help Overview

Within the business help section, you'll need to bypass many common options.
1.  Go to the "First steps" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  Look for "Get in Service with the service contact of attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
3.  This page provides an "Help Account Overview" for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Here, you can view "Recent Problems of the account" and "Resolved" issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Initiating the Support Request

To begin a new support request:
1.  Locate "If I need them Help" and select "contact the service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  **Crucial Step**: When prompted to describe your problem, select an option that ensures you are not redirected to another website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. For example, choose "I think someone You have accessed my company without permission," even if your actual issue is unrelated. You will explain your specific problem to the support agent later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Providing Information for Account Recovery

After selecting your initial problem type, you will need to provide specific information to proceed with [[providing_information_for_facebook_account_recovery | account recovery]] and initiate the chat:
1.  Enter the name of your company and your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  Provide a detailed description of your issue, such as "I need help to recover My Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
3.  Input your user identifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
4.  Specify a date for the "suspicious time" (e.g., "yesterday") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
5.  Answer questions regarding detection of "any user suspicious" or "any advertising account with Suspicious activity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
6.  Click "initiate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Starting the Chat

After initiating, you will see an estimated wait time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
1.  Click "Start chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  A Facebook Company Chat window will open on the right side of your screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, allowing you to directly communicate with Facebook support to begin [[solving_facebook_account_issues | solving Facebook account issues]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

This article provides a tutorial on how to add superscripts and subscripts to text within Microsoft Excel cells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This functionality is useful for formatting data, particularly in scientific or mathematical contexts where indices are required, such as in graphs or for specific values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The demonstration uses an older Excel document, approximately three or four years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How to Add Superscripts and Subscripts

### Traditional vs. Preferred Method

Traditionally, users might indicate superscripts or subscripts by placing an up arrow (↑) or down arrow (↓) next to the number, indicating whether it should be above or below the baseline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, Excel offers a proper formatting option.

### Step-by-Step for [[using_superscripts_in_excel | Superscripts]]

To apply a [[using_superscripts_in_excel | superscript]] (or "super índex" in Spanish) to a character in Excel:
1.  **Select the character** you wish to format within the cell (e.g., the number '3') <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
2.  **Access Format Cells**: Click the small arrow located in the "Font" group on the Home tab, or right-click the selected text and choose "Format Cells..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  **Apply Superscript**: In the "Format Cells" dialog box, under the "Font" tab, check the "Superscript" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
4.  **Confirm**: Click "OK". The selected character will now appear as a [[using_superscripts_in_excel | superscript]] within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

For example, if you type "H2O" and want the "2" to be a subscript, or if you have a density graph where a "3" needs to be a [[using_superscripts_in_excel | superscript]] (e.g., m³), this method ensures correct formatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Step-by-Step for Subscripts

The process for applying a subscript (or "sub índex" in Spanish) is identical to applying a [[using_superscripts_in_excel | superscript]]:
1.  **Select the character** you wish to format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  **Access Format Cells**: Open the "Format Cells" dialog <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  **Apply Subscript**: In the "Font" tab, check the "Subscript" box <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
4.  **Confirm**: Click "OK". The selected character will now appear as a subscript within the cell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Visualizing in Excel

While the character appears formatted in the cell, it will typically show as normal text in the formula bar at the top of Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. However, within the cell itself, the [[using_superscripts_in_excel | superscript]] will appear above the baseline and the subscript below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

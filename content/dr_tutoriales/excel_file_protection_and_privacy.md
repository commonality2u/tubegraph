This article provides a [[step_by_step_tutorial_to_access_excel_without_password | step by step tutorial to access Excel without password]] and manage its protection features, focusing on [[removing_password_from_excel_files | removing password from Excel files]] and protecting sensitive data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing a Password-Protected Excel File

To begin, open an Excel file that is currently password-protected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The file will prompt you to enter the password (e.g., "SD") before granting access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Removing a Password from an Excel Workbook

Once you have successfully entered the password and gained access to the Excel file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>:

1.  Navigate to the "File" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
2.  Click on "Info" from the left-hand menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
3.  Select "Protect Workbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
4.  Choose the "Encrypt with Password" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
5.  The current password will be displayed in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. To remove the password, simply delete the text from this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
6.  Click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
7.  Close and save the Excel file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Upon reopening the file, it will no longer require a password for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Additional Protection Options

Beyond protecting the entire workbook, Excel offers more granular [[protecting_sheets_and_structure_in_excel | protection of sheets and structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>:

*   **Protecting Sheets:** You can protect individual sheets within a workbook, which is useful for confidential or private data that should not be viewed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Protecting Structure:** Excel also allows for the protection of certain structures or boards, preventing unauthorized changes to the layout or arrangement of the workbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

This article explains the specific requirements and potential limitations when [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduling emails]] in Outlook.

### Core Requirement for Scheduled Emails
A crucial condition for a [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduled email]] to be sent is that the Outlook application must be open and running on the computer at the time of delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. If Outlook is not open on your computer at the scheduled delivery time, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Important Limitation
> This is considered a "weak point" of Outlook, as emails will only be sent if the application is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This means if you [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | schedule an email]] for tomorrow at 5 AM, but your Outlook is not open at that exact time, the email will not be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Therefore, the application *must* be open for the mail to be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

### Expiration Date for Scheduled Emails
Outlook also provides an option to set an expiration date for a [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduled email]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. This means that if Outlook is not open by a certain date after the initial scheduled time, the email will no longer attempt to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This feature allows users to define a cutoff point for sending a [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduled email]] in case the primary condition (Outlook being open) is not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

While [[withdrawing_money_from_coinbase_to_paypal | withdrawing money from crypto platforms to PayPal]] is an option, you can also transfer funds directly to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This process involves converting your cryptocurrency into fiat money and then sending it to your desired bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency

Before you can withdraw your funds to a bank account, you must convert your cryptocurrencies (like Polygon Matic) into conventional fiat money, such as Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is necessary because cryptocurrencies are not considered legal tender that can be directly stored in traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

To convert:
1.  Navigate to the "operating and selling" section of your platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
2.  Search for the cryptocurrency you wish to sell (e.g., "Matic") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  Select the option to sell your crypto and convert it to your national currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Commission Considerations

When selling cryptocurrencies, commissions may apply. For instance, selling 2.76 Matic might incur a commission of one Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For potentially lower commissions, consider [[using_alternative_platforms_for_crypto_to_fiat_withdrawal | using platforms like Coinbase Pro]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Withdrawing Fiat Currency to Your Bank Account

Once your cryptocurrency has been converted into fiat currency, you can proceed to withdraw it to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

1.  Go to the fiat currency section (e.g., Euro balance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  Select the "withdraw funds" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

You will typically be presented with two main methods for withdrawal:

### 1. Debit or Credit Card Withdrawal (Not Recommended)

You can add a debit or credit card to withdraw funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, this method is generally not recommended due to high commissions, which can be around 2.5% of the transaction amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### 2. Bank Account Transfer (Recommended)

You can choose to add and use a direct bank account for withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

*   **Commission**: The commission for a direct bank transfer can be significantly lower, for example, 0.15 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Processing Time**: A bank transfer typically takes about one to two days for the funds to appear in your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

You will receive an email confirmation to the address associated with your account once the withdrawal has been processed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

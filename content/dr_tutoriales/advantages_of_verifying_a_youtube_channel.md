Verifying your YouTube channel provides several benefits, enabling access to advanced features not available to unverified accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This process is distinct from acquiring the "verified ticket" badge, which requires 100,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

*   **Custom Thumbnails** Access to custom thumbnails for your videos becomes available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **Live Broadcasting** The ability to conduct live broadcasts is enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Increased Uploads and Streams** Verified accounts can upload more videos and conduct more live streams per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

*   **Monetization Eligibility** [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube | Monetization]] requires channel verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Accessing Verification Settings

To view and manage your channel's verification status and features:
1.  Go to [[YouTube Studio configuration for channel management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Configuration" (located on the left side) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
3.  Select "Permissions" or "Channel Permissions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
4.  Within the channel section, you can manage the features and see which functions require verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Some functions may require a valid identity document or video verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

For specific [[requirements_for_youtube_channel_verification | requirements for YouTube channel verification]], you can access "more information" or the "verify you" section within these settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

Gmail labels are a powerful tool for [[managing_email_folders_in_gmail | organizing]] and [[prioritizing_emails_in_gmail | prioritizing]] your email inbox. Unlike traditional folders, emails can have multiple labels, allowing for flexible categorization and easy retrieval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Accessing Label Settings

To begin [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | organizing]] your Gmail inbox with labels:
1.  Enter your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "Configuration" (settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  Select the "Labels" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This window displays what is visible on the left-hand sidebar, such as important chats or sent emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Creating New Labels

The primary goal is to [[creating_labels_in_gmail | create new labels]] to organize your emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
1.  In the "Labels" window, look for the option to "create new labels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  Give your new label a name. For example, a label named "YouTube" could be created to group all emails related to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Creating Sublabels (Nested Labels)

To further refine your organization, you can [[using_sublabels_in_gmail_for_better_organization | create sublabels]] that nest under a parent label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
1.  When [[creating_labels_in_gmail | creating a new label]], select the "Nest tag in" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Choose the parent label (e.g., "YouTube") from the dropdown menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
3.  For instance, "comments" and "subscriptions" could be created as sublabels under the "YouTube" label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Nested labels will appear slightly indented to the right, visually indicating their hierarchy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Managing Existing Labels

*   **Deleting a Label**: If you wish to remove a label, click the "delete" option next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Modifying a Label**: To change a label's name or other properties, click "modify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying Labels to Emails

To apply a label to one or more emails:
1.  Select the desired emails in your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  Right-click on the selected emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
3.  Choose "Tag how" (or "Label as") and then select the appropriate label from the list, such as "YouTube subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. All selected emails will then be visible under that label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Similarly, emails related to comments could be labeled "YouTube comments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Color-Coding Labels

[[setting_colors_for_gmail_labels | Assigning colors to your labels]] can make them easier to distinguish at a glance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
1.  In the "Labels" settings, locate the label you wish to color-code.
2.  Choose a color from the available options. For instance, the "YouTube" label and its sublabels ("subscriptions," "comments") could all be set to red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
3.  Once set, all emails with that label will display the assigned color in your inbox, enhancing visual organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Award-Winning Anti-Fraud Systems
Revolut states that its anti-fraud systems are award-winning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. These systems aim to keep fraudulent transactions below 0.01 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The platform considers itself one of the top seven banks for fraud prevention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Account and Identity Verification
To ensure security and user protection, Revolut implements a verification process when [[creating_an_account_on_revolut|creating an account]]:
*   **Selfie Verification** Users are required to take a selfie for verification, with advice to use good lighting and remove anything that might obscure the face, such as glasses, hats, or scarves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Identity Document Scan** Users must scan their nationality document, such as a Spanish nationality document, for identity verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Upon successful verification, loading restrictions are lifted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Proof of Residence** Users are required to provide proof of residence, indicating their nationality and country of residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## In-App Security Measures
*   **Access Code** Users are required to set an access code for their Revolut account, with the screen hidden during input to protect information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Biometric Login** The app offers the option to use facial recognition (Face ID) for unlocking the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
*   **Activity Tracking** Users can allow activity tracking, which helps monitor if another person connects from a different device, providing awareness of account activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Contact Access** Granting access to contacts can simplify sending money to friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

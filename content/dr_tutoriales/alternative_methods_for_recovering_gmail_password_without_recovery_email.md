This guide outlines several alternative methods for [[recovering_a_forgotten_gmail_password | recovering a forgotten Gmail password]] when a recovery email is not available or set up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. These methods focus on utilizing previously saved information or alternative contact points.

## Prerequisites for Recovery

It is vital to attempt recovery from a computer or mobile phone that has previously accessed your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Google uses this access history as a reference to help restore or provide a new password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Method 1: Checking Saved Passwords in Browser Settings

If you have previously accessed your Gmail account from your device, your browser might have saved the password.

1.  Open [[using_browser_settings_to_recover_email_and_passwords | Google Chrome settings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Autofill" section and then "Passwords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
3.  Search for "Gmail" in the password list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
4.  Click on the eye icon next to your Gmail account to reveal the password. You may be prompted to enter your computer's PIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

This method is highly effective if you have previously accessed your account from the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. It can also be used if you have forgotten the email itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

## Method 2: Entering a Previously Used Password

If the browser method does not work, or you are trying to recover directly through Google's forgotten password flow:

1.  Go to the Gmail login page and enter your email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.
2.  When prompted for the password, click "Forgot password" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
3.  Google may ask you to enter a password you have used previously for that account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. If you remember an old password, Google may recognize it and allow you to proceed with recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Method 3: Using a Phone Number Associated with the Account

If a recovery email is not available, Google often provides the option to use a phone number associated with your account:

1.  After indicating you've forgotten your password, Google may prompt you to enter a phone number linked to the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
2.  If this option is presented, enter the number. Google will send a verification code to this mobile phone, which you can use to recover your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Method 4: Providing Another Email Account for Contact

If you don't have a recovery email or associated phone number, Google might offer the option to provide *any* other email account for contact purposes:

1.  When Google asks for a recovery method, choose "Try another way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
2.  You may then be asked to enter an email account that doesn't need to be associated with your Google account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. This could be a friend's or family member's email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>.
3.  Google will use this email to contact you and assist in the password recovery process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

## Method 5: Answering Security Questions

As a last resort, if no other contact method is available, Google will ask a series of questions to verify your identity:

1.  After exhausting other options, select "Try another way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.
2.  Google will then present questions related to your account or personal information you may have filled in previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>. You must answer these accurately to recover your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

Binance allows users to [[how_to_deposit_money_into_binance | deposit]] both fiat currency and cryptocurrencies into their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This process is considered an "external transfer," meaning money is moved from an outside source into the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

It's possible to create a Binance account with a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, operations, transactions, or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Accessing Deposit Options

To initiate a deposit, navigate to the "overview" section within the "wallet" part of the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, where you will find the "deposit" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Depositing Fiat Currency

When choosing to deposit fiat currency, such as Euros, Dollars, or Pounds Sterling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, various [[fiat_and_cryptocurrency_deposit_options | methods]] are available:
*   **Bank Transfer:** This includes options like Swift transfer and Wire transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.
*   **Card Payment:** This method is also available for fiat deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

The specific [[fiat_and_cryptocurrency_deposit_options | methods]] displayed will depend on the currency being deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

It is important to note that some conventional banks (e.g., Santander, Sabadell, BBVA in Spain) may block deposits from cryptocurrency platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. To avoid this, it is recommended to use accounts from banks like N26 or Revolut, which are less likely to block such transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Depositing Cryptocurrencies

[[how_to_deposit_money_into_binance | Depositing cryptocurrencies]] involves a different process compared to fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. When depositing crypto, you must:

1.  **Choose the Cryptocurrency:** Select the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit, for example, USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
2.  **Select the Blockchain Network:** It is crucial to choose the correct blockchain network (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20) from which the cryptocurrency will be transferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The network chosen for the deposit must match the network used by the sending platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
3.  **Use the Wallet Address/Code:** Binance will provide a unique code, which acts as the "ID" or "serial number" of your wallet, similar to a postal address for a letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This address must be used by the external wallet or platform sending the cryptocurrency to ensure it reaches your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

> [!important]
> If the deposit order is not made with the correct network (e.g., sending via ERC-20 when BEP-20 is selected on Binance), the cryptocurrency will be lost and will not reach its destination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The code generated is different for each network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

Once the sending platform initiates the transfer using the correct network and address, the cryptocurrency typically arrives at your Binance account within two to three minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

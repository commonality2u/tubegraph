This guide explains how to transfer or deposit cryptocurrencies and fiat currencies into your Binance account from external sources. The process involves distinguishing between internal transfers (within Binance wallets) and external transfers (to or from Binance from another platform/wallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This article focuses on external deposits to your Binance account.

## Overview of Deposits

To deposit funds into your Binance account, navigate to the 'Wallet' section and select 'Overview' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Here, you will find options for 'Deposit,' 'Withdraw,' or 'Transfer' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. The 'Transfer' option is for moving assets between your internal Binance wallets (e.g., from your Spot Wallet to your P2P account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. For bringing funds *into* Binance from outside, you'll use the 'Deposit' function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

Binance allows you to [[understanding_deposit_methods_for_fiat_and_cryptocurrency_in_binance | deposit both fiat and cryptocurrencies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. The methods for depositing these differ based on the asset type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Depositing Fiat Currency

Fiat currency refers to traditional government-issued money like Euros, US Dollars, or British Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.

### Methods for Fiat Deposits
When depositing fiat currency, you will find various methods depending on the currency you choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>. Common options include:
*   **Bank Transfer**: This can include SWIFT transfers or other wire methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>.
*   **Card Payment**: Depositing funds using a bank card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

### Process
1.  Select 'Deposit' and choose 'Fiat' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>.
2.  Choose the specific fiat currency you wish to deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
3.  Binance will display the available deposit methods for that currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.
4.  Follow the instructions provided for your chosen method, which usually involves providing your bank account details or card information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Important Considerations for Fiat Deposits
Some conventional banks, such as Santander, Sabadell, or BBVA in Spain, may block transactions to and from cryptocurrency platforms like Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. If this occurs, the order may be canceled, and the funds could be delayed or not reach your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

It is recommended to use alternative banking services like N26 or Revolut for fiat deposits and withdrawals, as these accounts are less likely to block transactions with cryptocurrency platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

## Depositing Cryptocurrencies

Depositing cryptocurrencies involves transferring them from an external wallet or another exchange to your Binance account.

### Process
1.  Select 'Deposit' and choose 'Crypto' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.
2.  **Choose the Cryptocurrency**: Select the specific cryptocurrency you want to deposit (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Select the Blockchain Network**: This is a critical step. You must choose the correct blockchain network (e.g., ERC-20, TRC-20) that the sending platform or wallet is using for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.
4.  **Obtain Deposit Address**: Binance will generate a unique deposit address (a code or ID) for your Binance wallet on the selected network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. This address acts like a postal code and street address for your digital funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.
5.  **Share the Address**: Provide this exact deposit address to the person or platform sending you the cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
6.  **Confirmation**: Once sent, the transaction typically takes around 2-3 minutes to arrive in your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>.

### Crucial Warning for Cryptocurrency Deposits
It is extremely important that the blockchain network you select on Binance precisely matches the network used by the sender <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. If the networks do not match (e.g., sending via ERC-20 but selecting TRC-20 on Binance), the cryptocurrency will be lost and will never reach your destination wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Always confirm the network with the sender before initiating a deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

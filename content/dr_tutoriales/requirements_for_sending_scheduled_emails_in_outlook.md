When [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | scheduling emails]] in Outlook, it's crucial to understand a key requirement for their successful delivery.

## Essential Condition for Delivery

For a scheduled email to be sent, Outlook must be open and running on the computer at the exact time the email is set to be delivered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If, for instance, an email is scheduled for tomorrow at 5:00 AM, but Outlook is not open on your computer at that time, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This is considered a weak point of Outlook that needs to be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Understanding the "Expire" Option

Within the [[outlook_email_options_for_delaying_delivery | email options for delaying delivery]], there's an "Expires" setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This option allows you to set an expiration date for the scheduled delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. If Outlook is not opened by the scheduled send time and the expiration date passes, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### Key Takeaway
The email will only be sent if the Outlook application is open on the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, including when [[editing_scheduled_outlook_emails | updating the schedule]] for an email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

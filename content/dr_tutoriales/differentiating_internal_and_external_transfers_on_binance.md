Binance allows users to perform various types of transfers involving both fiat and cryptocurrencies. These can be broadly categorized into internal transfers (within the Binance platform) and external transfers (to or from other platforms/wallets/bank accounts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Internal Transfers on Binance

Internal transfers involve moving assets between different wallets or accounts *within* the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Binance offers various internal wallets, each designed for specific purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:
*   Fiat Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Margin Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
*   Isolated Margin Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Futures Wallet (e.g., Futures Coin-M, Futures USD-M) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   Stock Token Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | P2P Account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   Pool Pay Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>
*   Options Account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

The "Spot Wallet" acts as a general wallet where non-traded fiat and cryptocurrencies are held, akin to a physical pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### How to Perform Internal Transfers
Users can transfer assets from their Spot Wallet to other wallets or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. For example, to engage in [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | P2P trading]], assets need to be transferred to the P2P account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Similarly, for futures trading, assets would be moved to the Futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. These transfers are typically performed within the "Wallet" section, under "Overview," where a "Transfer" option is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Internal transfers are used to organize cryptocurrencies based on their intended use, such as investing in Binance products or engaging in specific trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## External Transfers on Binance (Deposits and Withdrawals)

External transfers involve moving funds between Binance and external entities, such as other cryptocurrency platforms, cold wallets, or traditional bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. These are primarily categorized as "Deposit" or "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

### Depositing Assets

Users can [[options_for_bank_transfer_from_binance | deposit fiat or cryptocurrencies]] into their Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The methods for deposit vary depending on the asset type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

#### Depositing Fiat Currency
For fiat currencies (e.g., EUR, USD, GBP), [[options_for_bank_transfer_from_binance | deposit methods]] include bank transfers (SWIFT, SEPA) and card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Available methods depend on the selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

#### Depositing Cryptocurrencies
When depositing cryptocurrencies, users must select the specific cryptocurrency and then choose the correct blockchain network (e.g., ERC-20, BEP-20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Binance provides a unique wallet address (ID or serial number) for the chosen coin and network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

:::danger Important: Network Mismatch Risk
It is crucial that the chosen network on Binance matches the network used by the sending platform/wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. If the networks do not match, the cryptocurrency will be lost and will not reach the Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The sender must specify which network they are using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
:::

Deposits typically take a few minutes to arrive (e.g., 2-3 minutes for USDT via certain networks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Withdrawing Assets

Users can [[options_for_bank_transfer_from_binance | withdraw funds]] from Binance to an external bank account or another cryptocurrency wallet on a different platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

#### Withdrawing Cryptocurrencies
To [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | withdraw cryptocurrencies]], users must select the coin (e.g., Bitcoin, BNB), provide the external wallet address, and choose the correct blockchain network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Network [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] are displayed and can vary depending on the chosen network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

#### Withdrawing Fiat Currency
To withdraw fiat currency, users select the desired currency (e.g., EUR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, enter the amount, and provide their bank account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | Withdrawal commissions]] apply (e.g., 0.8 EUR for EUR withdrawals) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The available withdrawal methods depend on the chosen currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

:::caution Bank Restrictions
Some traditional banks (e.g., Santander, Sabadell, or BBVA in Spain) may block or cancel transactions involving withdrawals or deposits from cryptocurrency platforms, leading to loss of access to funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

For smoother fiat transactions, it is recommended to use digital-friendly banks like N26 or Revolut, which are less likely to block cryptocurrency-related transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

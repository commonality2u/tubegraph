This tutorial provides a guide on how to [[keyboard_blocking_and_unlocking_in_windows_versions | block and unlock the keyboard]] on Windows computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The methods described are applicable not only to Windows 10 but also to Windows 7 and 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This information can be particularly useful if the keyboard has been locked accidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Blocking the Keyboard

To demonstrate the process, a TXT file is used as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Initially, the keyboard functions normally, allowing text input without issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The mechanism for [[using_windows_filter_keys_to_lock_the_keyboard | blocking the keyboard]] involves activating a feature called "Filter Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>:
1.  **Locate the Shift Key**: Identify the Shift key on the keyboard, specifically the one located beneath the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  **Hold Down the Shift Key**: Press and hold this Shift key for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
3.  **Activate Filter Keys**: After holding the key for approximately eight seconds, the computer will emit a sound, and a screen will appear asking if you want to turn on "Filter Keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Activation**: By default, the "Yes" option is presented, and many users click it unintentionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Confirming "Yes" will cause the keyboard to become unresponsive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. These filters are designed to block the keyboard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Unlocking the Keyboard

If the keyboard has been locked, [[how_to_unlock_the_keyboard_in_windows_10 | restoring its functionality]] is a straightforward process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>:
1.  **Hold the Shift Key Again**: Press and hold the same Shift key (under the Enter key) for another eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Keyboard Reactivation**: After holding the key for the specified duration, the computer will sound again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This action will reactivate the keyboard, allowing you to type freely once more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This effectively involves [[disabling_filter_keys_to_restore_keyboard_functionality | disabling the filter keys to restore keyboard functionality]].

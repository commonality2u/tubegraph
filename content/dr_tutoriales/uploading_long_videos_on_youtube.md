When creating a new YouTube account, the platform does not allow users to [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos longer than 15 minutes]] by default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. To enable this functionality, a phone verification process is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Enabling Longer Video Uploads

To [[enabling_longer_video_uploads_in_youtube_studio | activate the ability to upload videos longer than 15 minutes]] on your channel, follow these steps:

1.  **Access YouTube Studio**: First, access [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | YouTube Studio]] from your YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Settings**: Within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]], go to the `Settings` section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  **Go to Channel Settings**: In the `Settings` menu, select the `Channel` sub-tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
4.  **Access Feature Eligibility**: Within the `Channel` settings, proceed to the `Feature eligibility` (referred to as "access to functions" in the transcript) section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
5.  **Identify Required Verification**: You will see "Features that require phone verification," which includes [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | videos longer than 15 minutes]], custom thumbnails, and live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This feature is initially listed as "available" because it requires [[verification_process_for_uploading_longer_videos | phone verification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Verification Process

The [[verification_process_for_uploading_longer_videos | phone verification]] involves:

*   **Entering a Phone Number**: You must enter a valid phone number to verify your channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Receiving a Code**: You will receive a verification code via text message or a call to that number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Submitting the Code**: Select your country and how you prefer to receive the code (text message is an option) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, then enter the code to verify your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

Once your account has been verified, these features, including the ability to [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos longer than 15 minutes]], will be enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The Binance referral program allows users to invite friends to the platform and earn cryptocurrency together, with commissions up to 40% every time referred friends engage in trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This program benefits both the referrer and the referred user through shared commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Accessing the Referral Program

To find the referral section, navigate to your profile on the Binance main page and select the "Referral Program" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Referral System Mechanics

The referral system operates as follows:
*   When a new user opens an account using a referral link, they receive a 10% discount on commissions incurred from deposits, transactions, or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This acts as a method to [[methods_to_reduce_binance_commissions | reduce Binance commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
*   The referrer, in turn, receives 10% of the commissions paid by the referred person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This is part of the overall [[binance_commission_structure | Binance commission structure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   It is generally recommended to use referral projects with individuals who are likely to make investments or actively use their money for cryptocurrency transactions, maximizing the [[benefits_of_using_binance_referral_links | benefits of using Binance referral links]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Commission Sharing Percentages

Users can choose how the commission earnings are split between themselves and their referred friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>:
*   **Default Split**: A common split is 10% for the referrer and a 10% discount for the referred user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Higher Referrer Percentage**: Referrers can opt to receive 20% of the commissions while the referred user receives 0% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Higher Referred Percentage (Not directly supported as per transcript, but the opposite is true)**: If the referrer's account balance is higher than 500 BNB (Binance Coin), they can choose to give themselves 15% or 20% commission and 0% to the referred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. (Note: The transcript phrasing here is slightly ambiguous, but implies the referrer takes the higher share).

## Setting Up and Managing Referral Programs

The referral section provides a comprehensive dashboard for [[setting_up_and_managing_binance_referral_programs | setting up and managing Binance referral programs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>:

*   **Control Panel**: Displays key statistics such as earned bitcoins (from commissions), total number of transactions made by referred users, and the total number of referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Link Lists**: Users can view and manage their generated referral links. It's possible to generate new links and customize the percentage split for each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Friends List**: This section shows a list of users who have signed up using your referral links, displaying user IDs, account types (e.g., spot, mining, futures), and registration times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For privacy, full names are not disclosed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Commission History**: Users can review a detailed history of earned commissions, filtered by account type (e.g., spot, futures, mining). This allows for [[analyzing_referral_and_commission_statistics_on_binance | analyzing referral and commission statistics on Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Commissions are earned in the specific cryptocurrency that the referred person purchased at that moment, not necessarily in Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

## Using Referrals and Discounts on Binance

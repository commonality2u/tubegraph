This article outlines how to [[withdrawing_cryptocurrency_funds_to_a_bank_account | withdraw cryptocurrency funds]] from your [[sending_and_receiving_cryptocurrencies_with_coinbase_wallet | Coinbase Wallet]] to a bank account, specifically using Kraken as an intermediary to save on fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The process is identical whether performed on Android, iOS, or a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Why Use Kraken?

The tutorial suggests using Kraken over Coinbase for withdrawals because [[comparing_withdrawal_options_and_fees_on_coinbase | Coinbase]] charges more to [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | withdraw to a bank account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. A referral link for Kraken, offering a 20% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits, is mentioned as being available in the first comment of the original video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### 1. Prepare for Transfer on Kraken

1.  Navigate to the Kraken application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

3.  Select "Ethereum" from your assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  Tap on "Deposit" for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This will reveal the deposit address for Ethereum on the Serium blockchain (ERC-20), which is the blockchain hosting the cryptocurrency in [[sending_and_receiving_cryptocurrencies_with_coinbase_wallet | Coinbase Wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### 2. Send Funds from Coinbase Wallet

1.  In your [[sending_and_receiving_cryptocurrencies_with_coinbase_wallet | Coinbase Wallet]], initiate a "Send" transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  Select the full amount you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  Proceed to the next step and paste the Kraken Ethereum deposit address you copied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
4.  Review the transaction details, including the suggested network and commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Example commissions shown were 7.55 to 6.52 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
5.  Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The transaction will then be executed, and the funds will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
6.  Once confirmed, the assets will no longer appear in your [[sending_and_receiving_cryptocurrencies_with_coinbase_wallet | Coinbase Wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### 3. Verify Receipt on Kraken

1.  Wait for the transaction to complete, which may take several minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
2.  Once received, the Ethereum will appear in your Kraken account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

At this point, your funds are now on Kraken, from where you can then proceed to [[withdrawing_cryptocurrency_funds_to a bank account | withdraw them to your bank account]].

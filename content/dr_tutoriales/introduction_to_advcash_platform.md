Advcash is an electronic or digital wallet that enables users to manage capital online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. It is described as similar to PayPal or AlertPay but differs in its ability to facilitate trading with various cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Key Features

Advcash combines national fiat currencies within the same ecosystem and has 20 years of experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. It offers:
*   The ability to receive, process, and send cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Account Management

### Account Creation and Verification
Account creation on Advcash is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. To fully utilize the platform, verification is required, which involves scanning an ID or passport and performing mobile phone verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Without verification, an account remains inoperative, preventing deposits or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Security Settings
Advcash allows users to enable two-factor authentication via Google Authenticator, email, or mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Users can also change their password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Account Deletion
To delete an Advcash account, users need to access the verification section and find the option to delete their profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. It is crucial to withdraw all funds before deletion, as money in the account will be lost permanently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Deposits and Withdrawals

### [[depositing_and_withdrawing_funds_on_advcash | Depositing Funds]]
Advcash allows deposits of both fiat money and cryptocurrencies.
*   **Fiat Deposits**: Fiat money can be deposited via Visa, Mastercard, or SEPA transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
    *   SEPA transfers have a commission of 0% plus one euro and typically take three business days to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
    *   Deposits via Visa or Mastercard can incur commissions of up to 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Minimum SEPA deposit is 100 Euros, and the maximum is 10,000 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Daily limits are 10,000 Euros, monthly 30,000 Euros, and yearly 30,000 Euros, which can be increased by contacting support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
*   **Cryptocurrency Deposits**: Advcash generally does not charge commissions for depositing cryptocurrencies, as fees are typically applied by the exchange from which the funds are withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. For example, depositing Litecoin requires six confirmations from the blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Users must be careful when transferring cryptocurrencies, as mistakes can lead to irreversible loss of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

### [[depositing_and_withdrawing_funds_on_advcash | Sending and Withdrawing Funds]]

*   **Transfers to Visa/Mastercard**: Commissions apply, for example, 5 euros plus 2.5% for transfers exceeding 5 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

    *   Local bank transfers to various countries (e.g., Argentina, Canada, India, Japan) have commissions of 0.5% depending on the amount sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.

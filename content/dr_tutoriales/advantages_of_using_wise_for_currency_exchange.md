## Flexible Deposit Methods

Wise offers various methods for depositing capital into the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Users can choose between different options, including:

*   [[bank_transfers_and_paypal_transactions_on_wise | PayPal]], which also has a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   [[bank_transfers_and_paypal_transactions_on_wise | Bank transfers]], which are free of charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

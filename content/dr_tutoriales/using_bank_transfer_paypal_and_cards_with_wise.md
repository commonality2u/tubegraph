The process is identical whether using a PC or a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Available Deposit Methods and Commissions

Wise offers several [[methods_to_deposit_money_on_wise | methods to deposit money]], each with varying commissions and processing times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>:

*   **Debit Card / Credit Card**:
    *   Commissions: These methods incur an associated commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, depositing 200 Euros might cost 0.82 Euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Speed: Funds are typically added in a matter of seconds with Visa or Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

*   **[[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]]**:
    *   Commissions: [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]] transfers also have a commission similar to card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   To use [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]], users must enter their [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]] account details, ensuring sufficient funds are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

*   **Bank Transfer**:
    *   Commissions: This method is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   Process: For bank transfers, Wise provides specific bank details and requires a reference to be included with the shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Users confirm they are the account holder and typically perform the transfer via online banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Wise does not directly access the user's bank account to remove funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

*   **Other Methods**:
    *   The platform also lists methods like "AliPay" (for electronic accounts) and "iDEAL" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Users are advised to choose a method based on urgency and associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While bank transfers are free, card or [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | PayPal]] payments incur a small fee but are faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Completing a Deposit (Example: Card Payment)

The video demonstrates a quick card payment process:
1.  Select "Debit card / Credit card" as the payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
2.  Click "Continue with transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
3.  Enter the card number and other required details (e.g., expiry date, CVV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
4.  Once the payment is processed, a confirmation appears stating that the money is ready in the Wise balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. The deposited amount will then appear in the selected currency's balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

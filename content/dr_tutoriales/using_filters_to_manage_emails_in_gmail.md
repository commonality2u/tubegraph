This article explains how to [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | automatically organize emails in Gmail]] using filters, directing incoming messages to specific folders rather than the main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method helps in [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | organizing your Gmail inbox]] and [[prioritizing_emails_in_gmail | prioritizing emails]] based on their importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:01">[01:20:01]</a>.

## Prerequisites: Gmail Folders (Labels)

Before setting up filters, it's beneficial to have [[managing_email_folders_in_gmail | email folders (labels)]] created in your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. If you don't know [[creating_folders_in_gmail | how to create folders]], additional tutorials are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. For example, folders might include "YouTube," "Social Networks," "Google," and "Facebook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:33">[00:57:33]</a>.

## Steps to Automatically Organize Emails

The goal is to classify emails from specific senders to go directly into designated folders, bypassing the inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:97">[01:03:97]</a>.

1.  **Access Gmail**: Open your preferred browser (e.g., Google Chrome) and access your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:61">[00:41:61]</a>.
2.  **Identify and Select an Email**:
    *   Locate an email from the sender you wish to filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:09">[01:50:09]</a>. For instance, to filter YouTube notifications, select an email from `noreply@youtube.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
    *   With the email selected, click the three vertical dots (More options) and choose "Filter messages like these" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:40">[02:02:40]</a>.
3.  **Create the Filter**:
    *   A dialog box will appear, showing the sender's email address (e.g., `noreply@youtube.com`) in the "From" field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:37">[02:07:37]</a>. Click "Create filter" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a>.
4.  **Configure Filter Actions**:
    *   **Skip the Inbox (Archive it)**: Check this option to ensure emails do not appear in your main inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:44">[02:28:44]</a>. They will go directly to the specified folder as unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:54">[01:40:54]</a>.
    *   **Apply the label**: Select the desired folder (label) from the dropdown menu where you want these emails to be categorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:04">[02:34:04]</a>. For example, select "YouTube" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:56">[02:36:56]</a>.
    *   **Also apply filter to matching conversations**: Check this option to apply the filter to all existing emails that meet the criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:09">[02:41:09]</a>. This immediately moves past emails from the sender to the selected folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.
    *   Click "Create filter" to finalize the setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>.

After creating the filter, all emails from `noreply@youtube.com` will instantly move to the "YouTube" folder and be marked as unread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:07">[02:56:07]</a>.

To test this, a user can comment on their own YouTube video from a secondary account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:09">[03:17:09]</a>. Upon sending the comment, the notification email will not appear in the inbox but will go directly to the "YouTube" folder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:07">[03:26:07]</a>. The count of emails in the "YouTube" folder will increase, confirming the email was automatically classified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:66">[04:09:66]</a>.

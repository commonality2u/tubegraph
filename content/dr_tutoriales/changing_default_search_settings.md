This article outlines how to change and manage default search engine settings within [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Users might find their default search engine changed from Google to alternatives like Yahoo or others, often due to inadvertently installing extensions or programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Navigating to Settings

To change your search engine settings:
1.  Open [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
2.  Locate the settings icon in the top right corner of the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  Click on "Settings" (or "Configuration" if your browser is in Spanish) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. The settings menu functions the same in both languages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
4.  A new tab will open displaying the settings page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Managing Search Engines

Within the settings tab:
1.  Navigate to the "Search Engine" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  Click on [[managing_search_engines_in_google_chrome | Manage Search Engines]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
3.  This section lists all installed search engines, including Google, Bing, Yahoo, and Ecosia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Setting Google as Default

To ensure [[making_google_the_default_search_engine_in_chrome | Google is your default search engine]]:
*   If Google is already listed, you can set it as default.
*   If Google is not present in the list, you will need to add its data manually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Click the pencil icon next to the search engine you want to edit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   For Google, input "Google" as the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   In the "ShortCat" (or URL) field, enter `Google.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
    *   It is crucial to use `.com` instead of country-specific domains like `.es` or `.uk` to avoid potential problems, especially if you are outside that country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Once changes are made, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

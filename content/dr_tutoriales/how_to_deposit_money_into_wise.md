This tutorial explains [[methods_to_deposit_money_on_wise | how to deposit capital]] into the [[wise_platform_tutorial | Wise platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Wise allows users to manage money, make currency exchanges, and send money to other countries with low [[commissions_and_fees_on_wise | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The process demonstrated is performed on a PC, but it is "exactly the same" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> on a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. It is assumed that you already have a created and verified Wise account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Navigating to the Deposit Section

1.  Log in to your Wise account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  Your current balance in various currencies (e.g., euros, British pounds) will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
3.  To add money to a specific currency, click on that currency. For example, to deposit euros, click on "euros" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
4.  Then, click the "Add" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The "Convert," "Send," and "Request" buttons will not be active until funds are added <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Specifying Amount and Payment Method

1.  Choose the amount of money you wish to add (e.g., 200 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  Confirm that you will pay with the selected currency (e.g., euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Wise also offers an option to receive salary or pension directly into a bank account on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
3.  Press "Continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

## Choosing a Deposit Method

After continuing, you will be presented with different [[using_bank_transfer_paypal_and_cards_with_wise | deposit methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Each method has different associated [[commissions_and_fees_on_wise | commissions]] and speeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Debit/Credit Card**:
    *   This method usually incurs a commission (e.g., 0.82 for 200 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Payments with Visa or Mastercard are typically processed in a matter of seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
    *   You will need to input your card number to complete the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **[[steps_to_deposit_funds_into_a_paypal_account | PayPal]]**:
    *   This method also has a commission similar to card transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
    *   You will need to introduce your [[steps_to_deposit_funds_into_a_paypal_account | PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> and ensure the account has the required funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

*   **Bank Transfer**:
    *   This method is free, meaning it does not cost anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   You will be provided with the necessary bank details (e.g., IBAN data) and a reference associated with your shipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   You confirm you are the account holder and choose to do it via online banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **Other Methods**:
    *   Other options like "Blee" (for electronic accounts) and "iDeal" may be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Consider the urgency of the transfer when choosing a method. Bank transfers are free but may take longer, while card or [[steps_to_deposit_funds_into_a_paypal_account | PayPal]] payments are faster but incur fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Completing the Deposit

Once the payment method is selected and details are entered, the money will appear in your Wise balance almost immediately for card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. For example, 200 euros loaded via card will be visible in the balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Accessing Google Calendar

To access [[how_to_use_google_calendar | Google Calendar]], open a new tab and navigate to the Google applications icon (the little squares) on the top right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. From there, you can select "Calendar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Calendar View Options

[[how_to_use_google_calendar | Google Calendar]] allows you to set the view based on day, week, month, or year using the options on the right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Viewing by month is often recommended for its visual clarity, and the days of the month are also visible on the left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. You can also toggle the visibility of pre-set items, such as holidays, if your calendar appears too busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

You can also [[configuring_notifications_and_events_in_google_calendar | configure notifications]] for your calendar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

You can also configure notifications for events and canceled events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. These notifications are useful for daily organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Adding an Event
To add an event to your calendar:
1.  Click on a specific date (e.g., April 23rd) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

6.  Save the event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

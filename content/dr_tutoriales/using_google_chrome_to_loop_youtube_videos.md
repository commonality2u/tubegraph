This tutorial explains [[how_to_put_youtube_videos_on_loop | how to put videos on loop]] on the YouTube platform so they play continuously without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>. This feature allows users to [[benefits_of_looping_youtube_videos | listen to music or watch videos automatically]] and restart without interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">00:00:17</a>.

## Requirements

To utilize this feature, it is recommended to use [[using_google_chrome_extensions_for_transcription | Google Chrome]] as the web browser, as it is a trusted and perfectly functional search engine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">00:00:36</a>.

## [[steps_to_activate_and_deactivate_loop_mode_on_youtube | Steps to Activate Loop Mode]]

To set a YouTube video to loop:
1.  Navigate to any desired YouTube video within [[using_google_chrome_extensions_for_transcription | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">00:00:43</a>.
2.  Right-click anywhere on the video frame with your mouse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">00:01:07</a>.
3.  A dropdown menu will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">00:01:10</a>.
4.  From this menu, click on the "Loop" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">00:01:13</a>.

> [!INFO] How it Works
> Once activated, the video will automatically restart from the beginning when it reaches its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">00:01:16</a>. This means the video will continue to play indefinitely without any further action required from the user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">00:00:21</a>. The video demonstrates this by showing a video advancing and then restarting automatically after reaching the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">00:01:26</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">00:01:34</a>.

## [[steps_to_activate_and_deactivate_loop_mode_on_youtube | Steps to Deactivate Loop Mode]]

To turn off the looping feature:
1.  While the video is playing, right-click on the screen again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">00:01:45</a>.
2.  The same dropdown menu will reappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">00:01:47</a>.
3.  Click on the "Loop" option again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">00:01:49</a>.

> [!NOTE] Playback Behavior
> Once deactivated, when the video finishes, it will no longer restart but will instead end and pause playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>.

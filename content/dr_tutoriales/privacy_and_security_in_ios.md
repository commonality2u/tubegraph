On an [[mobile_phone | iOS mobile phone]], users can manage privacy and security settings through the device's "Settings" menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. If not immediately visible, the settings can be found by searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Accessing Privacy & Security Settings

Within the "Settings" menu, scroll down to find "Privacy & Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This section is identified by a blue hand symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Key Sections

Inside "Privacy & Security," there are distinct sections, including:
*   Location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>
*   Tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

## [[managing_location_settings_on_ios | Managing Location Settings on iOS]]

The "Location" section allows for comprehensive control over location services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Global Location Services

Location services can be turned off entirely, deactivating them for all applications on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It is also possible to cancel location sharing generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Find My iPhone

The "Find My iPhone" feature can be activated to help locate a lost or stolen device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Per-Application Location Management

Users can manage location access for individual applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. This allows for specific permissions for different apps, such as:
*   Allowing location access only when the app is in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>
*   Prompting for permission each time the app requests location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   Never allowing location access for a specific app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   Always allowing location access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

Examples of applications where location settings might be adjusted include Air Canada, Volt, La Compass, Uber, and Bolt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Some applications may have location services disabled by default or user choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

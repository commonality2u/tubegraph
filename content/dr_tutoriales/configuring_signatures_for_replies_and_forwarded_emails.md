Outlook allows users to efficiently [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | create and modify email signatures]] and assign them to specific email types, such as new messages, replies, or forwarded emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This flexibility is useful for [[managing_multiple_email_signatures_for_different_accounts | managing multiple email accounts]] or maintaining consistent branding across different communication types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Accessing Signature Settings

To begin configuring your signatures in Outlook, follow these steps:
1.  Navigate to the top menu in Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.
2.  Select "Options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
3.  Choose the "Mail" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
4.  Click on "Signatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
    *   *Note*: The interface is largely the same whether Outlook is in English or Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Creating and Designing Signatures

Within the Signatures window, you have the ability to [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | create new signatures]] or modify existing ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Signatures can be customized with various elements:
*   Text in any desired format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   [[adding_images_and_text_to_email_signatures | Imported images]], such as a company logo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Personal details like your name, email, and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

After designing your signature, remember to save it by clicking "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Assigning Signatures for Replies and Forwards

Outlook allows you to set specific signatures for different email actions, especially useful when [[managing_multiple_email_signatures_for_different_accounts | managing multiple email accounts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>:
1.  **Select Email Account**: Choose the email account for which you want to configure the signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  **New Messages**: Configure the signature to be used for new emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
3.  **Replies/Forwards**: Crucially, you can set a distinct signature for "Replies/forward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This allows for a shorter, more concise signature for ongoing conversations compared to a full signature for initial outreach.
    *   For example, you can choose a signature named "Subscribe" to be used for replies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Changes**: Once your selections are made, click "OK" to apply the configurations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Verification

After configuring, when you create a new email, the defined signature will automatically appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Similarly, upon replying to an email, the signature specifically set for replies will be included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

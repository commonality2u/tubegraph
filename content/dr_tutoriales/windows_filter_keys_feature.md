The [[how_to_unlock_keyboard_on_windows_10 | ability to block and unlock]] the computer keyboard, specifically known as Windows filter keys, is a feature designed to prevent accidental key presses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This tutorial focuses on how to activate and deactivate this feature, particularly for [[how_to_unlock_keyboard_on_windows_10 | unlocking a keyboard]] that has been locked accidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>

While the tutorial demonstrates the process on Windows 10, the method is also applicable to Windows 7 and Windows 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Activating Filter Keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>

To activate the Windows filter keys, follow these steps:
1.  Locate the Shift key on your keyboard. This is typically found beneath the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Press and hold the Shift key for at least eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
3.  Upon successful activation, the computer will emit a sound, and a screen will appear asking "Do you want to turn on the Filter keys of Windows Ten?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
4.  The "Yes" option is often selected by default, leading to unintentional activation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Once activated, the keyboard will be blocked, meaning it will no longer register key presses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Deactivating Filter Keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>

If your keyboard is blocked by the filter keys feature, you can [[blocking_and_unlocking_keyboards_on_windows | unlock it]] by:
1.  Pressing and holding the Shift key again for eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  The computer will sound again, indicating that the keyboard is now fully functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

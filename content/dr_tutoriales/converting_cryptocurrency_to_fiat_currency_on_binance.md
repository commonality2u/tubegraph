This guide explains how to convert cryptocurrency held on a platform, such as BNB on Binance, into fiat currency and withdraw it to a bank account using the Binance application on a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The process is identical whether using an iPhone or an Android device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Initial Steps: Opening the Binance Application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

2.  Identify the cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Transferring Cryptocurrency to Binance (if not already there)

If your cryptocurrency is not already on Binance, you will first need to transfer it to your Binance account. This demonstration uses BNB from a Trust Wallet.

1.  From your external wallet (e.g., Trust Wallet), select "Send" for the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
2.  On the Binance platform, navigate to the deposit section and select "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  Choose the cryptocurrency you are depositing (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
4.  Select the appropriate blockchain network (e.g., Beacon Chain for BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
5.  Copy the provided wallet address and the memo (if required) from Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
6.  Paste the copied wallet address and memo into your external wallet's send function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
7.  Confirm the transaction and associated commissions (e.g., two cents for this transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Your capital will then be sent to Binance's Spot Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Solving issues with a Facebook account can be a complex process that requires careful attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide outlines the steps to [[how_to_contact_facebook_support | contact Facebook support]] and initiate a chat to resolve problems.

## Accessing Facebook Support

The primary [[Facebook help]] link often leads to frequently asked questions and typically does not allow direct contact with support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. To proceed, you must navigate to the [[using_facebook_business_help_service | Help for businesses service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Creating a Company Profile (If Necessary)

If you have not yet created a company within the Business Help Service, it can be done quickly using your existing Facebook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Initiating Contact with Support

Once in the Business Help Service:
1.  Bypass the initial options and go to the "First steps" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
2.  From there, select "Get in Service" or "Contact attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This section provides an overview of your business help account, showing recent problems, resolved issues, and your accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  Scroll down to "If I need help" and click to [[initiating_a_chat_with_facebook_company_support | contact the service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Selecting a Problem Category

When prompted to state your problem:
*   **Be cautious:** In many cases, selecting a problem may redirect you to another website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Bypass redirects:** To avoid redirection, directly select the option "I think someone has accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This choice allows you to proceed to a chat interface.

## Providing Information and Starting the Chat

After selecting the "unauthorized access" option:
1.  Provide the name of your company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
2.  Enter your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
3.  Proceed to [[providing_information_to_facebook_support | provide the information]] regarding your actual issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   Example: "I need help to recover my Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    *   Include your user identifier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
    *   Specify the date of the suspicious activity (e.g., "yesterday") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   Indicate if you have detected any suspicious users or advertising accounts with suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  Click "initiate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
5.  The system will show an estimated wait time for a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
6.  Click "Start chat" to open the [[initiating_a_chat_with_facebook_company_support | Facebook Company Chat]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Once the request is sent, the chat interface will appear on the right side of the screen, where you can await a reply from Facebook support, typically within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

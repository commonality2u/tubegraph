This article outlines how to reduce the file size of PDF documents, focusing on the different compression settings available and their impact on quality and file size. Reducing PDF size is crucial for sending documents via platforms like WhatsApp or email, which often have minimum quantity requirements, and for saving space on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Compression Method

The tutorial demonstrates using the online tool "I Love PDF" for compressing documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Available Compression Options
When compressing a PDF, "I Love PDF" presents three distinct compression options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>:
*   **Extreme Compression**
*   **Recommended Compression**
*   **Low Compression**

### Impact of Compression on Quality
A general principle of file compression is that the more a file is compressed, the less quality it will retain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This means sacrificing quality in the PDF, including images, videos, and text, to achieve a smaller file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Case Study: Recommended Compression

A practical example was provided using a PDF file named "Fati Case Stadis" that initially weighed approximately 7.82 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

### Compression Results
By choosing the **Recommended Compression** setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>:
*   The original file size of 7.82 megabytes was reduced to 1.76 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   This represents a 78% reduction in file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Quality Assessment
For the demonstrated PDF, which primarily contained text and some images, the quality loss was minimal after the recommended compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It's noted that opting for "Extreme compression" could lead to an even smaller file size, but would likely result in greater quality degradation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Additional Compression Techniques

For even further file size reduction, it is possible to combine the PDF compression with [[additional_compression_with_windrard | WinRar]] compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. A separate tutorial is available on how to compress files using [[additional_compression_with_windrard | WinRar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

A previous tutorial also detailed how to compress videos, which can be useful for reducing their size on a computer or for sharing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

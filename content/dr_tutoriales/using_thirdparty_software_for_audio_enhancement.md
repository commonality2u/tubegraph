Third-party software can be used to increase microphone volume beyond system defaults, which is useful for subsequent editing or live streaming to ensure clarity for subscribers and listeners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

## Utilizing Software for Volume Adjustment

A second method for increasing microphone volume involves downloading and using a specific program, referred to as "abs raw" or "vsr" in the transcript, which allows for recording videos at a desired volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. These videos can later be modified or converted to audio format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This program is described as simple and useful for passing audio at higher volumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.

### Steps to Adjust Microphone Volume with Third-Party Software

1.  **Select Microphone**: Navigate to the "microphones and auxiliaries" section, go to settings, then properties, and choose the microphone you wish to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
2.  **Access Audio Mixer**: Go to the audio mixer window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
3.  **Advanced Audio Properties**: Right-click within the audio mixer and select "advanced audio properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
4.  **Adjust Volume**: This will display the different microphones or audios interacting in the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. You can adjust the volume of your selected microphone. The standard volume is 0.0 decibels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
5.  **Increase Volume**: To [[adjusting_microphone_properties_and_levels | increase the microphone volume]], simply move the slider. However, it's important to note that increasing the volume using this technique, especially beyond standard levels, may raise the volume but can progressively decrease the [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | quality of the audio]], making it sound slightly worse but louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. This aspect of [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | audio quality]] must be kept in mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

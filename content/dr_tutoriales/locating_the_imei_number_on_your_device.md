The International Mobile Equipment Identity (IMEI) is a unique identification number for a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This number is crucial for identifying a device, especially if it is [[how_to_check_if_an_iphone_is_stolen_or_lost | lost, disappeared, or stolen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Apple registers the IMEI as a lost device if you report your phone missing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

When purchasing a second-hand device, it is highly recommended to [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | check the IMEI number]] to verify its status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## How to Find Your IMEI Number

The IMEI number can be found in several locations on your device, depending on its state.

### On a Working iPhone (Through Settings)

For a device that is already running and accessible, you can find the IMEI number through the settings menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>:

1.  Open the "Settings" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "General" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
3.  Tap on "Information" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
4.  Scroll down to locate the IMEI number(s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### On a Locked or New Device

If your device is locked or has been reset (e.g., when buying new), finding the IMEI might require different steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The video indicates that a screenshot would be provided to show how to find it in such cases, describing it as "very simple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Physical Locations

The IMEI number may also be physically present on the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>:

*   On the device's casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   On the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## [[understanding_dual_sim_iphones_and_their_imei_numbers | Dual SIM iPhones]] and Multiple IMEI Numbers

iPhones with [[understanding_dual_sim_iphones_and_their_imei_numbers | Dual SIM]] capability will display two IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This is because each SIM card slot has an associated IMEI number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If your device has two SIM cards, you will have two IMEI numbers, and it is important to check both when [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | verifying the device's status]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This means a single iPhone can have multiple IMEI numbers, one for each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

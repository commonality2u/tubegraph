### Downloading and Initial Setup
1.  **Download the App** Search for "Coinbase Wallet" on Google Play (for Android) or the App Store (for iOS) and download it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Open the Application** Once downloaded, open the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

5.  **Choose a Username** Select a username, which can be public for easier crypto sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
6.  **Set Privacy** Choose between a public username (allowing others to search for you and send crypto) or a private one (preventing other wallets from finding you) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Wallet Backup and [[security_and_storage_options_in_coinbase_wallet | Security and Storage Options in Coinbase Wallet]]
After initial setup, you must back up your Coinbase Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

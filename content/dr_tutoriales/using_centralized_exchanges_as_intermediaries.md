Withdrawing capital from platforms like MetaMask to a bank account cannot be done directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Instead, an intermediary is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This intermediary is typically a centralized exchange (CEX) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. The process involves first transferring cryptocurrency from MetaMask to the centralized exchange, and then from the centralized exchange to the bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Why Use a Centralized Exchange?
A centralized exchange acts as a bridge between your decentralized wallet (like MetaMask) and your traditional bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. They facilitate the conversion of cryptocurrencies into fiat money (e.g., Euro, Dollar, Pound sterling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> and enable transfers to bank accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Examples of Centralized Exchanges
Several centralized exchanges can be used for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Examples include:
*   Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   KuCoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>
*   [[using_different_platforms_like_kraken_and_crypto_dot_com_for_better_exchange_rates | Kraken]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   [[using_different_platforms_like_kraken_and_crypto_dot_com_for_better_exchange_rates | Crypto punto com]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

For a centralized exchange to be suitable as an intermediary, it must allow SEPA (Single Euro Payments Area) transfers from its platform to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Fees and Referrals
Withdrawal fees can vary between exchanges:
*   [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | Binance]] typically charges around one euro for transfers to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   [[using_different_platforms_like_kraken_and_crypto_dot_com_for_better_exchange_rates | Kraken]] or Coinbase withdrawals are generally free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Some exchanges offer referral links that provide bonuses, such as a 10-15% discount on [[exchange_platform_fees_and_commissions | commissions]] for transactions and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Bank Account Compatibility
It is crucial to use a [[choosing_a_compatible_bank_for_withdrawals_from_exchanges | compatible bank for withdrawals from exchanges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, as not all [[using_bank_accounts_compatible_with_cryptocurrency_exchanges | bank accounts compatible with cryptocurrency exchanges]] accept withdrawals from centralized exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Conventional banks like Santander or BBVA may block transactions, causing funds to be returned to the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Recommended neobanks for transacting with exchanges include:
*   Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
*   N26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>

## Withdrawal Process via Centralized Exchange
The overall process is two-fold:
1.  [[Transferring cryptocurrency between platforms | Transferring cryptocurrency between platforms]] from MetaMask to the centralized exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
2.  Withdrawing funds from the centralized exchange to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Step 1: Transferring from MetaMask to Exchange
1.  **Open MetaMask:** Ensure your MetaMask wallet is open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
2.  **Identify Cryptocurrency and Blockchain:** Determine which cryptocurrency you have (e.g., USDT) and on which blockchain (e.g., BNB Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. A small amount of the native token (e.g., BNB for BNB Smart Chain) is needed to cover gas fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
3.  **Obtain Exchange Wallet Address:**
    *   Open your chosen exchange app (e.g., [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | Binance]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   Navigate to the "Wallets" section, then "Spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Select "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
    *   Select the corresponding network (e.g., BNB Smart Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
    *   Copy the wallet address provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
4.  **Send from MetaMask:**
    *   Go back to MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   Click "Send" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Paste the copied exchange wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Select the cryptocurrency and amount to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Review the gas fee (paid in the native token of the blockchain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
5.  **Confirmation:** Wait for the transaction to confirm on the blockchain and appear in your exchange wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Step 2: Withdrawing from Exchange to Bank Account
Once your capital is on the exchange platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
1.  **Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat:**
    *   Navigate to the "Trading Markets" or "Convert" section of the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Convert your cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) into fiat currency (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Confirm the conversion, noting that there are often no [[exchange_platform_fees_and_commissions | commissions]] for this conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Fiat Withdrawal:**
    *   Go to your "Wallet" and "Spot" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Select "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Choose "Withdraw Fiat" (fiat money like Euro, Dollar, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
3.  **Select Withdrawal Method:**
    *   **Bank Transfer:** This option typically involves a small fee (e.g., one euro on [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | Binance]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   **Bank Card:** This method may incur higher [[exchange_platform_fees_and_commissions | commissions]] (e.g., 1.8% of the transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
4.  **Choose Currency:** Select the fiat currency you wish to withdraw (e.g., Euro, Australian Dollar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Withdrawal:** Follow the prompts to complete the withdrawal to your linked bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

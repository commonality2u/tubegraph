## Step-by-Step Instructions

### 1. Locate the Facebook Video
Navigate to the video you wish to download on the main Facebook page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### 2. Access Mobile Version on PC
Once on the video page, modify the URL in your browser's address bar. Replace "www" and "http" with "m" to load the [[viewing_facebooks_mobile_version_on_computer | mobile version of Facebook]] on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### 3. Inspect Video Element
*   In the mobile version, right-click on any blank space within the video player area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   Select "Inspect" from the context menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. A developer window will appear on the right side of your screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### 4. Play the Video Briefly

This should highlight a specific element in the developer window that represents the video's original source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This highlighted line is the origin of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

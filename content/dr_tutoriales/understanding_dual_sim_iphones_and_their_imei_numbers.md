Every Apple device has an [[using_imei_number_for_iphone_verification | IMEI number]] (International Mobile Equipment Identity), which serves as its unique identification number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This number is crucial because if a mobile phone is lost or stolen, Apple can register its IMEI as such, making it discoverable if someone attempts to use or sell it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. When [[steps_to_verify_a_used_iphone_before_purchase | purchasing a second-hand device]], it is highly recommended to [[how_to_check_if_an_iphone_is_stolen_or_lost | check the IMEI number]] to confirm the device is not stolen, missing, or otherwise reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Locating the IMEI Number

The IMEI number can be found in several locations on an iPhone:
*   On the device's casing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   On the SIM card adapter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Through the device settings: Navigate to "Settings" > "General" > "Information" and scroll down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

If the device is locked, newly purchased, or has been reset, the IMEI can still be found; the presenter mentions a screenshot showing this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Dual SIM and IMEI Numbers

A key point for modern iPhones is the concept of dual SIM functionality. If an iPhone supports dual SIMs, it will have *two* IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   It's important to understand that there isn't one IMEI per iPhone; rather, there is one IMEI associated with each SIM card slot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   If a device has two SIM cards, it will present two distinct IMEI numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   When checking the status of a dual SIM device, it is crucial to check *both* IMEI numbers to ensure neither is reported as stolen or lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Checking IMEI Status Online

To verify if an iPhone is reported as lost or stolen, its IMEI number(s) can be entered into a dedicated web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The process typically involves:
1.  Accessing the verification website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
2.  Copying and pasting the IMEI number into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  Completing a "not a robot" verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  The site will then report the status of the IMEI, indicating if it's activated, if [[importance_of_find_my_iphone_feature | Find My iPhone]] is enabled, if it's unlocked, or if it has been reported as stolen or on a "BlackBook" (blacklist) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

This tutorial outlines two methods for [[increasing_microphone_volume_in_windows_10 | increasing the volume of your microphone]] on a Windows 10 computer or laptop, which can facilitate subsequent editing, direct streaming, or other platform use, ensuring your audience hears you with clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Method 1: Adjusting Through Windows Sound Settings

This method focuses on [[adjusting_microphone_properties_and_levels | adjusting microphone properties and levels]] directly within Windows settings.

### Steps to Increase Microphone Volume

1.  **Access the Start Taskbar**: Navigate to the Start taskbar, located at the bottom of your screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
2.  **Search for Sound Settings**: In the search bar, type "sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
3.  **Open Sound Settings**: Select "Sound settings" from the search results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.
4.  **Select Input Device**: In the Sound settings window, navigate to the "Input" section. This is for sound input, not "Output," which controls speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. Ensure the correct microphone is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. For example, if you are recording with a "phono filter," ensure it is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. You should see the audio volume increase as you speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
5.  **Access Device Properties**: Click on "Device properties" for the selected microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
6.  **Adjust Microphone Volume**: Within device properties, you can see the microphone volume. It is typically set to 100% by default, which is the maximum volume your microphone can capture without reducing [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | sound quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Sound Quality
> Increasing the microphone volume beyond its recommended maximum (100%) can considerably decrease [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | sound quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Keeping it below or at 100% ensures it remains within the quality allowed by the microphone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

### Alternative for Windows 10 Users

If a different window appears in Windows 10, you can still adjust the volume:
1.  Go to the "Levels" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
2.  Set the microphone volume to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
3.  Apply the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

## Method 2: Utilizing OBS Raw (or Similar Software)

This second method is very useful for [[activating_microphone_for_screen_recording | activating microphone for screen recording]] and allows you to record videos at your desired volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. These videos can then be modified and converted into audio format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.

### Steps to Adjust Volume in OBS Raw

1.  **Download OBS Raw**: A link to download OBS Raw (or similar software) will be provided in the video description or comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Microphones and Auxiliaries**: Open the software and go to the "microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.
3.  **Access Settings and Properties**: Click on "settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, then "properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>.
4.  **Choose Microphone**: Select the microphone you wish to use and adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
5.  **Open Audio Mixer**: Go to the "audio mixer" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
6.  **Access Advanced Audio Properties**: Right-click within the audio mixer window and select "advanced audio properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. This will display different microphones or audio sources interacting in the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
7.  **Adjust Volume**:
    *   You may see the computer microphone and your recording microphone activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
    *   The computer microphone can be muted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
    *   Locate the volume control for the microphone you are recording with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
    *   The standard volume is 0.0 decibels, which corresponds to 100% of the volume selected previously in Windows settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
    *   To increase the volume, adjust the slider. This will progressively raise the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

> [!important] Quality vs. Volume
> Increasing the volume progressively in this method can increase the volume but may lead to a decrease in [[understanding_audio_quality_and_volume_balance | audio quality]], making the sound slightly worse but louder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Keep this in mind when making adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

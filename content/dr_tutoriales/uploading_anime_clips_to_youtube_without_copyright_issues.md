Uploading video fragments from series, films, or animes to YouTube often results in bans due to copyright infringement, affecting both audio (music, voices) and images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can lead to videos being blocked from public view or even monetized videos being banned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. To circumvent these issues, specific [[video_editing_techniques_to_avoid_copyright_bans_on_youtube|video editing techniques]] can be employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Recommended Editing Software

The video demonstrates the use of Filmora 9, a video editing program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_copyright_detection|Strategies for Avoiding YouTube Copyright Detection]]

The following strategies are presented as effective methods for [[strategies_for_avoiding_youtube_copyright_detection|avoiding YouTube copyright detection]] for both visual and audio content:

### Image Modification
To prevent YouTube from [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube|tracking copyright]] through images, it's crucial to modify the original video's visual elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

*   **Channel Logo/Watermark**: Add your channel's logo or a watermark and ensure it is visible throughout the entire video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This retouches the video and its image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **Visual Effects**: Apply effects provided by the editing program, such as a "leak of light," which subtly modifies the visual appearance of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Borders/Frames**: Add an "edge" or border around the video. This can be customized (e.g., blue at the bottom, white at the top for a blurred effect) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. The size and color of the border can be edited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   **Video Resizing**: The overall size of the video can be edited and exposed within the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The technique of leaving the video on the screen complete with a border and logo is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Audio Modification
Modifying the original audio is also a key step to avoid copyright detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

*   **Volume Adjustment**: When importing a video into Filmora, it comes with a default sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. It is recommended to reduce the original video's volume slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This modification prevents YouTube from detecting the original audio peaks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Uploading the Edited Video

After editing the video with the modifications (logo, border, audio changes), the next step is to upload it to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Upload Process
To upload a video, navigate to the "Create" button on YouTube and select "Upload videos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Select the edited video file (e.g., from the desktop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Follow the prompts, clicking "Next" for audience settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

### Verification
Once the video has processed after [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads|uploading]], check for any restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If the editing techniques were successful, the video should be in public [[visibility_and_copyright_considerations_on_youtube|visibility]] without any restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

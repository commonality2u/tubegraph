Excel offers robust features to protect specific parts of a workbook, ensuring confidentiality and preventing unauthorized modifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. While the video primarily focuses on [[removing_password_from_excel_files | removing the password from an Excel workbook]], it briefly highlights the capabilities for granular protection of individual sheets and the workbook's structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Accessing Protection Options

To manage protection settings within an Excel file:
1.  Open an Excel workbook, such as one named "finances" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "File" section of the document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>, also referred to as "file" or "document" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
3.  Click on "Info" on the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
4.  Within the "Info" section, locate and select "Protect Workbook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This option will be enabled if protection is active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

## Types of Protection

The "Protect Workbook" feature allows for various levels of security:

*   **Protect Current Sheet**: This option enables you to protect individual sheets within the workbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This is useful for sheets that contain private or confidential information that should not be viewed or altered by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Protect Workbook Structure**: Beyond individual sheets, you can also protect the overall structure of the workbook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, preventing users from adding, deleting, hiding, or renaming sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Encrypt with Password**: While detailed in the video for [[removing_password_from_excel_files | removing a password]], this option allows setting a password for the entire file, requiring it to be entered before the workbook can be opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

The editing part of these protection features is described as "very complete" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

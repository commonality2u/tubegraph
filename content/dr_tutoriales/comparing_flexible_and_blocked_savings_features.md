This tutorial explains how to utilize the savings features on a cryptocurrency exchange to generate profitability from your cryptocurrencies, focusing on [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible]] and [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is important to study the market and the profitability offered by these savings options to make informed decisions about which cryptocurrencies to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Accessing Savings Features

To access these features, navigate to the "Finance" section on the exchange, then select the "Earn" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This section compiles all programs designed to help users earn profitability from their cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Under "Earn," you will find options like flexible terms, fixed terms, and high-risk products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The two main terms discussed are "savings" (flexible) and "blocked savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## [[explanation_of_flexible_and_locked_staking_options | Understanding Flexible Savings]]

[[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible savings]] allow users to deposit and withdraw their cryptocurrency at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. When you subscribe, you provide a cryptocurrency (e.g., Bitcoin) and receive an annual profitability rate, for example, 1.20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Key Characteristics:
*   **Withdrawal Flexibility**: You can deposit and withdraw your currency whenever you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The interest rate is generally more or less fixed, though it can vary and is not a constant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Returns are typically lower compared to blocked savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Interest Calculation**: Interest begins to calculate from the second day after subscription; you do not receive interest on the day of subscription or deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Subscription Hours**: Flexible products are closed for subscription during UTC 23:50:00 to 00:00:10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Use Case**: Recommended for funds that might be needed, or for investments that are not strictly long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

An example of subscribing to [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] with Cardano (ADA) is shown, where a user can deposit a specified amount (e.g., 100 ADA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. After confirming the transfer, the capital begins producing daily profitability from the next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## [[explanation_of_flexible_and_locked_staking_options | Understanding Blocked Savings]]

[[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked savings]] involve depositing a cryptocurrency for a specific number of days, meaning the funds are locked for that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Key Characteristics:
*   **Withdrawal Restriction**: Funds cannot be withdrawn before the chosen duration ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate**: The interest rate (profitability) varies and is generally higher than flexible savings, increasing proportionally with longer deposit durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Duration Options**: Common durations include 7, 14, 30, and 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Use Case**: Best used when the money is not needed for a certain period, or for very long-term investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Risks**: While not considered a high-risk product, users are exposed if the currency devalues during the blocked period, as they cannot withdraw their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Subscription Hours**: Similar to flexible savings, there are periods (e.g., 23:55:00 to 00:00:10) when subscriptions are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

The longer you commit your asset, the more profitability you will earn, as you are giving the platform greater confidence and time to generate returns (e.g., through commissions or providing liquidity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

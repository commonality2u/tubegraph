When a new [[registering_and_logging_into_youtube_account | YouTube account]] is created, the platform does not initially allow the upload of videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. To enable this and other advanced features, specific configurations must be made within [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]].

## Accessing YouTube Studio

The first step for [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_channel_management | channel management]] is to directly access [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]] from your YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Channel Configuration in YouTube Studio

1.  Navigate to the "Configuration" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
2.  Within "Configuration," select the "Channel" sub-tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
3.  Go to the "Access to Functions" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Here, you will see two main categories of functions:
*   **Default Functions**: These are typically enabled by default and include abilities like [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | uploading videos]], creating playlists, and adding video collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Functions that require phone verification**: These features are initially listed as "available" but not enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. They include:
    *   Videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>
    *   Custom thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>
    *   Live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>

To enable these [[youtube_studio_features_for_enabling_long_video_uploads | YouTube Studio features for enabling long video uploads]], a [[youtube_account_verification | phone verification]] process is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | Phone Verification Process]]

To verify your account and enable longer video uploads, you must provide a phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. YouTube will send a verification code to this number via text message or call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Steps for Verification

1.  **Select Country**: Choose your country from the options provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
2.  **Choose Verification Method**: Decide whether you prefer to receive the verification code via text message or an automated call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
3.  **Enter Phone Number**: Input your phone number into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
4.  **Send Code**: Click "Send" to have the verification code sent to your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
5.  **Enter Code**: Once you receive the code, enter it to complete the verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

After successful completion of the [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | verification process for YouTube account to upload longer videos]], the account will be verified, and you will be able to upload videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The "Access to Functions" section will then show these features as "enabled" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

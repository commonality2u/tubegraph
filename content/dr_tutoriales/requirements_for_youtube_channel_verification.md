To have the official verified checkmark displayed on a YouTube channel, a channel must possess at least 100,000 subscribers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This is distinct from other forms of [[youtube_account_verification | account verification]] that unlock specific features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Unlocking Features via Phone Number Verification

To enable certain functionalities, it is necessary to [[phone_number_verification_for_youtube | Verify Phone Number]] for your YouTube account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This [[verification_process_for_youtube_account_to_upload_longer_videos | verification process]] unlocks:

*   The option to use custom thumbnails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   Access to live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Requirements for Advanced Features

To gain access to more advanced channel functions, further verification methods are required. These include:
*   More video uploads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Increased daily live stream capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   The ability to create Shorts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Eligibility to apply for monetization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

These advanced features necessitate verification through:
*   A valid identity document <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Channel history review <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Video verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Accessing Verification Settings

To manage and initiate the [[youtube_channel_verification_process | verification process]] for your channel, navigate to the [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

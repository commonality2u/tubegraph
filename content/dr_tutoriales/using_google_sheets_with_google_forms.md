Google Forms offers various ways to [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | view and analyze responses]] from your created forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Beyond the in-form summary, you can specifically leverage Google Sheets for more detailed data management and analysis.

## Accessing and Viewing Responses

Upon creating a Google Form, such as the example "YouTube form" with fields like name, email, and tutorial topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, responses are collected in a dedicated "Responses" tab within the Google Form interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Within the form itself, responses can be viewed in three main ways:
*   **Summary** This view provides an overview of all responses, which is the speaker's preferred method for seeing all data at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. It allows for a global analysis of responses from all participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Question** This tab allows you to view responses for each question individually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. For example, for "Question 1", you can see all individual responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
*   **Individual** This option lets you view all questions answered by each specific person who submitted the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Exporting Responses to Google Sheets

For more robust data handling, Google Forms allows you to [[exporting_google_form_responses_to_csv_or_excel | export responses]] directly to Google Sheets or download them in CSV format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

To open responses in Google Sheets:
1.  Navigate to the "Responses" tab in your Google Form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
2.  Locate and click the "View in Sheets" icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Once opened in Google Sheets, the responses are organized with columns for each question and a timestamp column indicating when each form was submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This includes data such as the respondent's email, tutorial topic, satisfaction, questions asked, platform used, and subscription status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Additional Features

*   **Email Notifications**: Within the "Responses" section, by clicking the three dots menu, you can opt to [[receiving_email_notifications_for_google_form_responses | receive email notifications]] every time someone responds to your form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.
*   **Response Destination**: You can also select where new responses will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **Unlinking Form**: The option to unlink the form from its current response destination is also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

Compressing PDF documents is a common practice to reduce their file size, making them easier to send via platforms like WhatsApp or email, which often have [[limitations_and_considerations_for_pdf_text_versus_scanned_images | size limitations]], or to save space on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This process involves reducing the file's "weight" to occupy less storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## How Compression Works

The core principle behind PDF compression is the sacrifice of quality for a smaller file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. The more a file is compressed, the lower its quality will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This reduction in quality applies to various elements within the PDF, including images, videos (if any), and text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Compression Settings
Online tools like I Love PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> (accessible via a direct link in the first comment of the source video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>) offer different [[comparison_of_compression_settings | compression settings]]:
*   **Extreme compression**: Achieves the smallest file size but results in the most significant quality loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Recommended compression**: Provides a balanced reduction in size while aiming to maintain acceptable quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Low compression**: Offers the least reduction in size but preserves the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Case Study: PDF Compression
To demonstrate the impact of compression, a PDF file named "Fati Case Stadis" (a document from university classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>) was used.

### Initial File Size
Before compression, the "Fati Case Stadis" PDF had a size of 7.82 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This can be checked by right-clicking the file and selecting "properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Compression Process and Result
Using the "recommended" compression setting on I Love PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, the PDF was compressed:
*   The file was reduced by 78% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   Its size decreased from 7.82 megabytes to 1.76 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Post-Compression Quality
After the recommended compression, the quality of the PDF was observed to be largely maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This specific document primarily contained text and some images <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The amount of quality lost depends on the chosen compression level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Choosing "extreme compression" would have resulted in an even smaller file size, but with a more noticeable reduction in quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Further Compression Techniques
For even greater file size reduction, it's possible to combine PDF compression with other [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | file compression techniques]], such as compressing the PDF further using tools like WinRAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This strategy is also covered in a separate tutorial on compressing videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, which demonstrates [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | video compression techniques]] and [[features_of_a_video_compressor_app | features of a video compressor app]].

Revolut is a platform offering various financial services and features, designed to help users manage their money efficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This includes an introduction to its diverse functionalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> and the process of [[how_to_create_a_Revolut_account | creating an account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The platform aims to provide advantages and specific characteristics that make it worthwhile for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Account Types
Revolut offers different account types. This article focuses on personal accounts for individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, as business accounts are primarily for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Key Features

### Financial Management and Budgeting
Revolut allows users to [[managing_finances_with_Revolut | manage their money]] effectively through expense analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Users can categorize expenses by types such as transportation, restaurants, or shopping, which helps in understanding spending patterns and controlling expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Financial Goals and Vaults
The platform enables users to set financial objectives using "personal vaults" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. These vaults function like dedicated savings pots for specific goals, such as a travel fund for a trip to Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Users can set a target amount and contribute regularly, allowing for more controlled saving and efficient money management to achieve their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### International Transfers
Revolut is well-known for its [[international_transfers_with_Revolut | international transfer]] capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, allowing users to send money globally instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While it states "no hidden commissions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, it doesn't mean there are no commissions at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

*   **Commission Structure**: The first 1,000 euros (or equivalent in other currencies) transferred in another currency to a different bank account in another country are commission-free for standard accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Exceeding Limits**: Transfers exceeding 1,000 euros will incur charges for standard account holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. However, Premium and Metal account holders are not charged for transfers beyond this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
*   **Example**: Sending 2,000 pounds from an English Revolut account to a Spanish account will incur a fee for a standard account, but it's free for Premium and Metal users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
*   **Comparison**: While standard banks may charge for international transfers, Revolut aims to keep commissions low, especially for smaller amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For larger payments or frequent international transfers, upgrading to a Premium or Metal account is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Spending Abroad
Revolut allows users to "pay like a local" and obtain the real exchange rate for spending abroad in over 150 currencies without hidden commissions, making payments without additional charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Investing
Users have the option to [[investing_in_stocks_and_cryptocurrencies_using_Revolut | buy cryptocurrencies and gold]] in a matter of seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. The platform encourages users to keep money within the Revolut ecosystem by offering these investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It also mentions investments in the stock market without commissions, though this is relative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

### Security and Fraud Prevention
Revolut is recognized as one of the top banks for preventing fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Its award-winning anti-fraud systems maintain fraudulent transactions below 0.01 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

When [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | inserting online videos]] into presentations, such as PowerPoint, it is important to understand the connection requirements for playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Online Videos

Videos sourced from online platforms, like [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | YouTube]], can be directly embedded into presentation slides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. To view an online video within a presentation, an active internet connection is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. For instance, if a video from [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | YouTube]] is embedded using its URL, it requires an internet connection to be viewed during the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Without an internet connection, these embedded online videos cannot be seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Local Videos

In contrast, videos stored directly on the computer (local videos) can also be inserted into presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. These videos do not require an internet or Wi-Fi connection to be viewed during the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

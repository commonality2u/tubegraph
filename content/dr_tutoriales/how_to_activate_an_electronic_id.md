Activating an electronic ID (DNIe) requires a specific code, software installations, and an ID card reader. This guide outlines the steps to prepare your system and activate your DNIe.

## Prerequisites

Before starting, ensure you have the necessary code for your DNIe.
*   A code is issued on the day you receive your DNI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.
*   If you do not have this code, you can obtain it from automatic machines at the nearest police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.
    *   The process involves logging in with your ID card to these machines, signing up, and obtaining the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   This code serves as a PIN key, which will be needed later in the activation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:20">[02:00:20]</a>.

> [!INFO] Additional Resources
> A detailed tutorial on obtaining the code is available via a link in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. For further questions, you can contact the instructor via Instagram, linked in the first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## System Preparation: Software Installation

You will need to install specific software applications. Links to these downloads are typically provided in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Check System Architecture

Determine if your Windows system is 64-bit or 32-bit to download the correct software versions.
1.  Open File Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "This PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  Your system's operating system type (e.g., "64-bit operating system") will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Download and Install Required Software

You will need two main software packages: one from the government headquarters (likely related to the DNIe) and another for electronic signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

1.  **Electronic Signature Software (Auto-signature)**:
    *   Download the appropriate version for your system (e.g., Windows 64-bit browser) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Select the latest version, such as 1.82 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   After downloading, double-click the installer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   Proceed through the installation wizard:
        *   Click "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
        *   Click "Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
        *   Accept the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
        *   Optionally, configure it to trust Firefox root certificates if you use Firefox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
        *   Click "Install" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
        *   Click "Finish" once the installation is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   The auto-signature software will now be installed on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

2.  **FNMT Configurator**:
    *   Locate and open the FNMT configurator installer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Click "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   Proceed through the installer:
        *   Click "Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
        *   Accept the conditions to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
        *   Confirm the installation directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
        *   Start the installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    *   Once the installation is complete, click "Next" and then "Finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Connecting the ID Card Reader

To [[reading_the_chip_on_an_id_card_using_a_reader | read the chip on your ID card]], you need an external reader.
*   An ID card reader is essential for [[validation_of_electronic_certificates | validating electronic certificates]] from your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   The video provides an example reader available on Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Insert your ID card into the reader, ensuring the chip is correctly aligned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   Connect the reader to your computer via a USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A successful connection will typically be indicated by a sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   The device should now be reading your ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Validating Your Electronic Certificate

To verify the functionality of your DNIe and reader, you can validate the electronic certificates embedded in your ID card.
1.  Access the verification link provided in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This link will lead to a page that uses the previously installed signature software (FNMT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Click on the option to "Validate Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
3.  Click "Select Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
4.  The system will prompt you to open the auto-signature software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This software reads the [[requirements_for_embedding_a_digital_certificate | electronic certificates]] contained within your ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
5.  You will see different certificates associated with your name, including authentication and signature certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
6.  Choose an appropriate certificate (e.g., the DNI electronic signature certificate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
7.  Enter your secret code (the PIN key obtained earlier) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
8.  A "valid certificate" message will confirm successful activation, showing your name, surname, and ID card details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

If you have sent an email within Outlook and wish to cancel or delete it, this guide will walk you through the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Prerequisite for Recalling an Email

For the recall or deletion process to work, it is **super important** that the recipient has not yet opened the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If the email has already been opened, the recall attempt will not be successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Steps to Recall or Delete a Sent Email

1.  **Navigate to Sent Messages**: Go to your "Sent Messages" folder in Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Select the Email**: Locate and click on the specific email you wish to recall or modify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
3.  **Choose an Action**: Once the email opens, you will typically find options to "edit the message" or "remove" it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Look for a button or option with a symbol that indicates recall or modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
4.  **Select Recall Option**: You will generally be presented with two main choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>:
    *   **Delete the message completely**: This option aims to delete the message entirely from the recipient's mailbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
    *   **Delete it and send another modification**: This allows you to delete the original email and immediately send a corrected or modified version in its place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. For example, if you forgot to include a greeting, you can modify it and resend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
5.  **Confirmation and Notification**: Outlook will typically ask if you want to be notified whether the recall or modification was successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. You can choose to be notified or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
6.  **Execute Action**: Click the appropriate button (e.g., "OK") to confirm your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
7.  **Receive Confirmation**: If successful, you will receive a confirmation that you have attempted to recall the message, including the date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

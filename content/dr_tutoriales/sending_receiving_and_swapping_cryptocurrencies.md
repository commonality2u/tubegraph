Trust Wallet is a cryptocurrency application designed for both Android and iOS mobile devices, offering identical functionalities across both platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This guide explains how to use its core features, including setting up your wallet, [[transferring_and_managing_cryptocurrency_assets | sending and receiving cryptocurrencies]], and performing [[methods_to_convert_cryptocurrencies | cryptocurrency swaps]].

## Getting Started with Trust Wallet

To begin, you must download the Trust Wallet application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:55">[00:54:55]</a>. Once installed, you have the option to either import an existing wallet or [[managing_cryptocurrency_wallets | create a new one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>.

### Creating a New Wallet
If you choose to [[managing_cryptocurrency_wallets | create a new wallet]], you will need to accept the privacy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a> and enter an access code twice for security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>. The application then prompts you to make a security copy of your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a>.

### Wallet Security Phrase
A crucial step is to back up your 12-word secret phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>. It is essential to accept the conditions, which warn that losing this phrase will result in the permanent loss of your funds, and sharing it exposes your assets to theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:36">[01:36:36]</a>. Trust Wallet is not responsible for lost funds due to phrase mismanagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>.

The secret phrase will be displayed (though censored for privacy in the tutorial) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:51">[01:51:51]</a>. It is highly recommended to copy this phrase onto physical paper, as a PC is vulnerable to hacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:57">[01:57:57]</a>. After copying, you will arrange the words in the correct order to verify your wallet creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. Upon successful creation, your wallet will be ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>.

### Importing an Existing Wallet
If you already possess a wallet, you simply need to import your secret phrase (the words in the correct order) and then enter your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:05">[01:05:05]</a>.

## Key Wallet Features

Upon entering the wallet, you will see options for notifications and to view accepted cryptocurrencies within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:27">[02:27:27]</a>.

### Receiving Cryptocurrencies
To [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms | receive cryptocurrencies]], select the "Receive" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>. The application will display your unique address both as a QR code and as an alphanumeric string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>. It's crucial to note the supported blockchain for the specific cryptocurrency you wish to receive, as sending an incompatible coin to an address can result in loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. For example, when receiving BNB, it specifies that only BNB and Change can be sent to that address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:19">[03:19:19]</a>. Trust Wallet supports a variety of cryptocurrencies for receiving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a>.

### Sending Cryptocurrencies

However, this action requires you to have funds in your wallet to perform the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Swapping Cryptocurrencies
The "Swap" feature enables you to [[methods_to_convert_cryptocurrencies | exchange one cryptocurrency for another]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:44">[03:44:44]</a>. This function aims to use the best market rate available for the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:52">[03:52:52]</a>.

To read the chip on an ID card, you will need specific software and a dedicated ID card reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This process involves installing necessary software, connecting the reader with your ID card, and then validating the electronic certificates stored on the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:
*   A PIN key, which can be obtained from the nearest police station if you do not have it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. You typically register your ID card with machines at the police station to receive this code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.
*   Access to a computer with an internet connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Required Software and Downloads

You will need to download and install two main components:
1.  **Electronic Signature Software**: This software, often referred to as "self-signature," is essential for installing and managing electronic signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
2.  **FNMT Configurator**: This configurator is used to install and configure related features for your electronic ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Checking System Architecture
Before downloading, determine your computer's operating system bit version (64-bit or 32-bit) to download the correct software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Go to File Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   Right-click on "This PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
*   Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   Your system type (e.g., 64-bit Operating System) will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Installation Process
1.  **Download Software**: Download the appropriate versions of the electronic signature software and the FNMT configurator for your system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
2.  **Install FNMT Configurator**:
    *   Run the installer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Follow the prompts, accepting the conditions and choosing the installation directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   Complete the installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
3.  **Install Electronic Signature (Self-Sign) Software**:
    *   Locate the downloaded self-sign file and double-click to open its installer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   Proceed through the installation, accepting terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   If using Firefox, ensure it's selected to rely on the root certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   Finish the installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## ID Card Reader

You will need an ID card reader to physically read the chip on your ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These readers are typically available for purchase online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Connecting the ID Card and Reader
1.  **Insert ID Card**: Fit your ID card into the reader, ensuring the chip is correctly aligned to be read by the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
2.  **Connect Reader**: Connect the ID card reader to your computer via a USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. You should hear a connection sound, indicating the device is reading the ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Validating the Electronic Certificate

To verify that the reader is working and to access the electronic certificates:
1.  **Access Validation Tool**: Use a link, often provided by the FNMT or government headquarters, to access a certificate validation tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
2.  **Select Certificate**: In the validation tool, select "Select Certificate" and open the installed self-signature software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This software will read the electronic certificates from your ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
3.  **Choose Certificate Type**: Your ID card may contain different certificates, such as authentication or signature certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Choose the desired one, for example, the electronic DNI signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
4.  **Enter PIN**: Input your secret PIN code (obtained from the police station) when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
5.  **Validation Confirmation**: The system should then confirm that the certificate is valid, displaying your name, surname, and ID card details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

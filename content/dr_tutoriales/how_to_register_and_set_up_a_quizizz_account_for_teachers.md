## Creating and Sharing Quizzes

### Creating a New Quiz
To [[creating_and_importing_quizzes_on_quizizz | create a questionnaire]], select the "Create" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. You'll name your quiz (e.g., "Fractions Tutorial") and select a theme like "Mathematics" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

The quiz editor offers several options for adding questions:
*   **New Question:** Create a new question from scratch, choosing from multiple-choice, checkbox, or fill-in-the-blank formats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Teleport Question:** This useful feature allows you to search for and import questions from other existing quizzes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. You can add a question and then modify it to suit your needs, changing answers or difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Enhancements:** You can add an image to your quiz to make it more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

*   **Settings:** Before finishing, you can adjust settings like the image, language (e.g., Spanish), and grade level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. You can also choose to make the quiz public or private <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Sharing Quizzes with Students
Once your quiz is created, you can share it:
*   **Assign to Classes:** You can assign the quiz to your configured classes and schedule it for a specific date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This will send notifications to students in that class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This method uses the "Classes" option mentioned previously, which integrates with [[sharing_quizzes_with_students_via_google_classroom | Google Classroom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Practice Link:** For immediate sharing, you can generate a practice link that students can use to access and play the quiz whenever they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. You can copy and paste this link to send it to your students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

Quizizz also incorporates "memes" or visuals during quizzes to help students relax and perform better, making the test experience less serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

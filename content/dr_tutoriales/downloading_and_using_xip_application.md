## Downloading and Installation

The Xip application is available in the Apple Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. To find it, search for "Exif, meta data, meta data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The app icon is orange and labeled "photo, video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>, with a rating of 4.5 stars based on 153 reviews <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Application Features and Usage

The Xip application is primarily in English <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a> and offers both a free and a Pro option, with the free version being sufficient for most uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Initial Setup

Upon first use, you must allow the application to access your photos and select the ones you wish to view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.

### Viewing Photo Metadata

The application displays various details about a photo, including:
*   Image size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>
*   Camera details (e.g., iPhone 11) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>
*   Lens information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>
*   Geolocation data, such as longitude and latitude (coordinates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>

It's important to note that not all mobile phones have geolocation activated by default when taking photos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This setting can be managed in device permissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. Some photos may have location enabled, while others may not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. When location data is present, the app can display the exact location on a map <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

### Examples of Metadata
*   A photo of a bear was taken in Bristol, an English city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Clicking the map shows the exact location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   A photo taken at Niagara Falls accurately shows the location, specifically from the Skylon Tower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
*   A photo taken during a conference in Oxford also shows the location at Mansfield College <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
*   However, a photo sent to the speaker that was taken in Switzerland did not display any location or metadata because the sender did not have location services enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

### Adding New Photos
To add more photos to the app for metadata viewing, click the "plus" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. You can add the selected photo, and the app will display its location and camera details, converting it to JPG if needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.

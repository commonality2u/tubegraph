Mega is a web service primarily used for downloading and [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading content]], allowing individuals to share and download various files, including series, movies, and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Account Creation Process

To create a Mega account, follow these steps:
1.  Enter an email address to begin the signup process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.
2.  A confirmation email will be sent to the provided address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
3.  Confirm your account via the email to complete the setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Understanding Storage Plans

After creating your account, Mega will present various storage plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
*   **Free Plan**: The default option, offering up to 50 gigabytes (GB) of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While this is considered relatively small, it's sufficient for storing small or relatively small files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   **Paid Options**: Mega also offers paid plans, such as Lite and Pro accounts, for users who require more storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Optimizing Storage with Compressed Files

To make the most of the free 50 GB storage, it is recommended to [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compress files]] before [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **WinRAR**: A program like WinRAR can be used to compress files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   To compress a file, right-click on it and select "Add to archive" or "Add file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Set the archive format to "RAR", the compression method to "Best", and enable "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This can significantly reduce file size, for example, compressing 2.21 GB of data to 13.1 GB (this seems to be a typo in the original transcript, likely 2.21GB *uncompressed* to 1.31GB *compressed*) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Uploading and Sharing Files

After creating your account and optimizing files, you can proceed to [[uploading_files_to_mega | upload]] and [[sharing_and_managing_mega_download_links | share content]]:
1.  Navigate to the cloud symbol within your Mega account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
2.  Options available include creating a new folder, [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading]] individual files, or [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading]] entire folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  Once a file is [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploaded]], you can manage its link by right-clicking on the file and selecting "Manage link" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
4.  The link provided is a "link with key," which includes an encryption key necessary for access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. The encryption key can be copied separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
5.  Sharing both the link and its key allows others to download the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

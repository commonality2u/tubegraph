The Binance referral program allows users to invite friends to the platform and earn commissions together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Both the referrer and the referred can benefit from this program, typically through discounts on trading fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## How the Referral Program Works

When someone opens a Binance account using your unique referral link, they receive a discount on commissions for various operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. These operations include deposits, transactions, and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The person using the link typically gets a 10% discount on their commissions, and the referrer receives a percentage of those commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This means if you use a referral link, you save 10% on your fees, and the person whose link you used earns that 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Commission Percentages

By default, the typical referral link offers a 10% discount for the referred user and a 10% earning for the referrer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, these percentages can be varied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. For instance, a referrer might choose to receive 20% while the referred user receives 0%, or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Users can [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | generate new referral links]] and choose the percentage split for commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Options typically include 0%, 5%, or 10% for the referred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. If your account balance exceeds 500 BNB, you may have the option to set a 15% or 20% commission for yourself, with 0% for the referred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Referral Dashboard Features

The referral program dashboard provides several sections for monitoring and managing your referrals:
*   **Control Panel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   **List of Links** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>
*   **Friends List** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>
*   **Commission History** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>
*   **Shared Commissions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

The dashboard displays your earned Bitcoin amount, the total number of transactions made by your referrals, and the number of referrals you have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. It also features a classification based on the Bitcoin earned through referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

You can view the amount of friends who have opened accounts using each of your referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. The "Friends List" section displays user IDs (not names) of those who have affiliated, along with details like the type of account they have (e.g., spot, mining, futures), where they operate, and their registration time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This maintains user privacy by not revealing personal names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

### Commission History and Earnings

The "Commission History" section details the commissions earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. You can filter this history by account type, such as spot, futures, or mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The commissions you earn are paid in the specific cryptocurrency that the referred user bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. For example, if a referred person buys BNB, you will receive your commission in BNB, not Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This allows you to accumulate various cryptocurrencies in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

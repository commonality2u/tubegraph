[[how_to_contact_facebook_support | Contacting Facebook support]] can seem like a complicated process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide outlines the steps to initiate a chat with Facebook's company support team.

## Accessing Support
The direct Facebook help link typically leads to different questions and does not allow for direct support contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. To bypass this, you need to navigate to the [[using_facebook_business_help_service | business help service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

### Business Account Requirement
If you haven't created a company account yet, it can be done very quickly using your existing Facebook account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. No additional steps are required beyond having a Facebook profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Finding the Contact Option
1.  Once in the business help service, ignore the initial options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "First steps" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
3.  Look for options like "Find answers" or "Get in service with the service contact of attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This will take you to the "Help Account Overview for businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
4.  Within this overview, scroll down and click on "I need help" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>, then "contact the service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

When prompted to put your problem, it's crucial to pay close attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Often, entering your specific problem will redirect you to another website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

To ensure direct contact, select the option: "I think someone has accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if your problem is unrelated, you will explain it to support once connected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Required Details
After selecting the specific problem:
*   Enter the name of your company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   Provide your full name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   In the description box, explain the help you need, for example, "I need help to recover my Page" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
*   For the user identifier, you can copy the current user ID displayed on the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   Input the date of suspicious activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   Indicate if you've detected any suspicious user activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a> or suspicious advertising account activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## Initiating the Chat
1.  Once all information is provided, click "initiate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
2.  The system will show an estimated waiting time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

4.  A chat window will appear on the right side of your screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. You will need to wait for a representative to reply, which might take around seven minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

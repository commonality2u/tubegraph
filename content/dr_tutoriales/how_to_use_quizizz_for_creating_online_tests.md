Quizizz incorporates features like "memes" or "babies" (likely referring to reaction images or short animated clips) that appear during or at the end of tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These are included to help students relax and perform better by making the test experience less serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

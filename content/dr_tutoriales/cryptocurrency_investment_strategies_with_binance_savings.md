Binance offers various programs to help users gain profitability from their [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_binance | cryptocurrencies]] [00:01:23]. These include flexible and blocked savings options, which allow users to earn interest on their digital assets [00:00:05]. It is crucial to study the market and the profitability offered by these savings options to make informed investment decisions [00:00:20].

## Accessing Binance Savings

To access the savings features on Binance, navigate to the "finance" section within the Exchange interface [00:01:18]. This section compiles all programs designed to yield profitability from [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_binance | cryptocurrencies]] [00:01:23]. Users will find options like flexible terms, fixed terms, and high-risk products [00:01:33]. The specific focus here is on [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] and [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] [00:01:45].

## Types of Savings

Binance provides two primary types of savings: [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] and [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] [00:02:03].

### [[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible Savings]]

[[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible savings]] allow users to deposit and withdraw their [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_binance | cryptocurrencies]] whenever they choose [00:02:34]. Users provide a cryptocurrency, such as Bitcoin, and receive an annual profitability [00:02:22]. For instance, Bitcoin might offer an annual return of 1.20% [00:02:25]. The interest rate in flexible savings is generally stable but can vary [00:03:40]. While [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_binance_savings | returns are lower]] compared to [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]], the key advantage is the ability to withdraw funds at any time [00:03:37].

### [[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked Savings]]

[[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked savings]] require users to deposit a [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_binance | cryptocurrency]] for a specific duration [00:02:43]. During this period, the funds are locked, meaning they cannot be withdrawn until the chosen term ends [00:02:43, 00:06:07].

Users can select various durations for [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]], including 7, 14, 30, or 90 days [00:02:57]. The [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_binance_savings | interest rate]] and profitability vary based on the duration, with longer deposit periods typically yielding higher returns [00:03:04]. This is because providing a longer commitment to the asset allows Binance more time to generate profitability through commissions or liquidity provision [00:03:18, 00:03:29].

### Key Differences and Considerations

| Feature        | [[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible Savings]]                                      | [[blocked_savings_on_binance | Blocked Savings]]                                              |
| :------------- | :-------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | :--------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Withdrawal** | Anytime [00:02:37, 00:03:49, 00:05:59]                                          | After fixed duration only [00:02:46, 00:06:07]                          |
| **Profitability** | Lower, more or less fixed rate [00:03:40, 00:03:37, 00:05:57]                 | Higher, varies with duration [00:03:04, 00:03:14]                      |
| **Risk**       | Lower risk of being stuck in a devalued asset [00:04:36]                           | Exposed to asset devaluation if currency drops during lock-up [00:04:30] |
| **Use Case**   | When funds might be needed or for short-term holdings [00:03:51]                  | Long-term investment where funds aren't immediately needed [00:03:54] |

It is advisable to use [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] for funds that are not needed immediately or for very long-term investment strategies [00:03:51]. However, investors should carefully consider the market conditions and avoid depositing [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_binance | cryptocurrencies]] into [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] during a potential correction stage, as capital cannot be withdrawn during the locked period [00:04:08, 00:04:17, 00:04:30].

> [!CAUTION]
> While savings products are generally not considered high-risk, there is exposure to potential loss if the value of the deposited currency devalues, especially with [[blocked_savings_on_binance | blocked savings]] where funds cannot be withdrawn [00:04:27, 00:04:30].

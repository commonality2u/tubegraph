Withdrawing capital from cryptocurrency platforms like KuCoin directly to a bank account can sometimes be challenging due to limitations of the platform itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>. This guide explains how to use alternative platforms to convert cryptocurrencies to fiat currency and then withdraw to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:07">[02:39:07]</a>.

## Why Alternative Platforms are Necessary

When making deposits of national currencies (fiat) into platforms like KuCoin, an intermediary company often handles the transfer between the bank and the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>. However, this same intermediary company may not facilitate withdrawals of national currencies, meaning KuCoin might only allow cryptocurrency withdrawals, not fiat withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:40">[02:34:40]</a>. This necessitates transferring cryptocurrencies to a different platform that supports direct fiat withdrawals to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:07">[02:42:07]</a>.

## Recommended Alternative Platforms

Platforms that allow [[transferring_cryptocurrencies_between_platforms | cryptocurrency withdrawals]] to bank accounts include:
*   Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:51">[03:16:51]</a>
*   Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:28">[03:15:28]</a>
*   Crypto.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:39">[07:38:39]</a>

Referral links for creating accounts on Kraken or other platforms, which may offer bonuses, are often found in the video's description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>. For detailed tutorials on how to use Kraken or Coinbase, separate videos are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:40">[07:41:40]</a>.

## Process for Withdrawing Fiat Currency

The overall process involves several steps:

1.  **Transfer Cryptocurrency from KuCoin**:
    *   Navigate to the "Assets" section on the KuCoin platform to view your portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:40">[01:26:40]</a>.
    *   Select the withdrawal option. Note that KuCoin typically only offers cryptocurrency withdrawals, not national currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:08">[02:06:08]</a>.
    *   Choose a cryptocurrency with relatively low blockchain transaction fees for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:10">[03:00:10]</a>. For example, using the TRC-20 network for USDT can result in significantly lower fees (e.g., 1 USDT) compared to ERC-20 (e.g., 20-25 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:50">[04:47:50]</a>.
    *   Obtain the deposit address for the chosen cryptocurrency from your alternative platform (e.g., Kraken or Coinbase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:06">[03:48:06]</a>.
    *   Paste this address into the withdrawal section on KuCoin, specify the amount, and confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:04">[06:01:04]</a>.

2.  **Convert Crypto to Fiat on the Alternative Platform**:
    *   Once the cryptocurrency (e.g., USDT) arrives on the alternative platform, it will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:51">[09:45:51]</a>.
    *   Use the platform's exchange feature to [[converting_crypto_to_fiat_currency | convert the cryptocurrency]] to your desired fiat currency (e.g., Euros, Dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:26">[10:06:26]</a>.
    *   For Kraken, you can go to the "Prices" section, set the currency to Euro, and then sell your USDT for EUR via a market order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:37">[10:37:37]</a>.

3.  **Withdraw Fiat to Your Bank Account**:
    *   After conversion, your funds will be held as fiat currency in your platform wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:04">[11:47:04]</a>.
    *   Select the withdrawal option for fiat currency (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:04">[11:55:04]</a>.
    *   Add your bank account details or select an existing one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:21">[12:01:21]</a>. Withdrawal options may include wire transfer (SWIFT) or SEPA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:43">[12:05:43]</a>.
    *   Confirm the withdrawal to send the funds to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:18">[12:18:18]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Bank Account

Traditional banks like Santander or BBVA may occasionally block or return transactions from crypto exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:31">[09:01:31]</a>. To avoid this, it is recommended to use neo-banks such as Revolut, N26, or Living, as these are generally more compatible with crypto exchange transactions and offer free accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:26">[09:14:26]</a>. Tutorials for setting up accounts with these neo-banks are available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:29">[09:25:29]</a>.

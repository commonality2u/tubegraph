From there, proceed to the "video section" of your channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This section allows for [[content_editing_and_video_management_on_youtube | content editing and video management]] of your uploaded videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

To download videos from Facebook on your computer, the process involves accessing the video's original source URL through your browser's inspection tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method allows you to obtain the root version of the video for downloading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Accessing the Mobile Version

The first step is to navigate to the desired video on Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Once on the video's page, you need to modify the URL to access the mobile version of the site within your desktop browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

> To do this, remove the "WWW" and "HTTP" parts from the URL, and replace them with "M" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. This will take you to the mobile version of the page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Inspecting the Video Element

Once you are on the mobile version of the Facebook page containing the video, you will use your browser's inspection tool to find the video's source URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

1.  Right-click on a blank space within the video player area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  Select "Inspect" from the context menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This will open a window on the right side of your screen showing the page's code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
3.  Play the video for two or three seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
4.  After playing, click the "Inspect" button (often represented by an arrow icon) within the inspection window and hover over the video until the corresponding element is highlighted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
5.  Locate the element that represents the video's origin or source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Extracting the Video URL

Once you have identified the video's source element in the inspection window, you can extract its URL.

> Double-click on the identified video source element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This will highlight the URL string <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Copy the entire URL, ensuring it starts from "HTTP" or "HDTP" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Downloading the Video

With the video URL copied, you can now proceed to download it.

1.  Open a new tab in your browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
2.  Paste the copied URL into the address bar and press Enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This will open the video in its original, root version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
3.  On the video player, locate and click the three-dot menu icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
4.  Select "Download" from the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

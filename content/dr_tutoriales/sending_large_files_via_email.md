When sending files via email, especially through services like Gmail, a common limitation is the maximum attachment size, which for Gmail is 25 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. To send a greater number of files or larger files within a single email, compression is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Solution: Compressing Files with WinRAR

WinRAR is a program that facilitates file compression and decompression, allowing files to weigh less and be transported more easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### How to Get WinRAR

If you do not have WinRAR installed, you can download it by accessing a trusted search engine, such as Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. Search for "WinRAR," and the first option typically allows for its download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

### Compressing a File

Once WinRAR is installed:
1.  **Locate the file** you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
2.  **Right-click** on the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
3.  From the context menu, select the option to "Add to file..." or "Add to archive..." (represented by a book icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
4.  **Configure compression settings**:
    *   **Archive name**: Choose a name for the compressed file (e.g., "test1.rar") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Compression method**: Set to "Best" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Dictionary size**: Set to the least possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Divide into volumes**: Set to "0" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Compression options**: Select "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Password (optional)**: You can set a password for the compressed file if desired, but this is not required for compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
    *   Advanced settings typically do not need to be adjusted for standard compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.
5.  Click "OK" or "Accept" to begin the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Checking Compression Results

After compression, the new `.rar` file will appear. To check its size, right-click on the new file and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. For example, a 55.6 megabyte file can be compressed to approximately 43.9 megabytes, representing around a 20% reduction in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

### Alternative Compression Methods

Another method for video compression, separate from WinRAR, involves using VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

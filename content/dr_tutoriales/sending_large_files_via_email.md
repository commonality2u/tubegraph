Sending large files via email can often be problematic due to size limitations imposed by email providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. For example, Gmail has a typical limit of 25 megabytes per email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Compressing files reduces their size, allowing more files to be sent in a single email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Why Compress Files?

File compression makes files lighter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, making them easier to transport and send via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is particularly useful for files exceeding common email size limits, such as a video file weighing 55.6 megabytes, which cannot be sent through Gmail without compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Using WinRAR for File Compression

WinRAR is a program that facilitates file compression and decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Obtaining WinRAR

If WinRAR is not already installed, it can be downloaded by searching for "winrar" in a reliable search engine like Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The first search result typically allows for download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Compressing a File with WinRAR

Once WinRAR is installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, follow these steps to compress a file:

1.  **Locate the file:** Identify the file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  **Check file size (optional):** Right-click on the file, select "properties" to see its current size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
3.  **Initiate compression:** Right-click on the file and select the option labeled "add the file" (often represented by a book icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
4.  **Configure compression settings:**
    *   **Name:** Choose a name for the compressed file (e.g., `test1.rar`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The `.rar` extension indicates it's a compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   **Compression Method:** Select "best size" for optimal compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   **Dictionary size:** Set to "least possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Divide into volumes:** Set to "zero" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   **Compression Options:** Check "create a solid file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   **Password (optional):** A password can be added to encrypt the compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
    *   **Advanced settings:** No changes are typically needed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
5.  **Start compression:** Click "Accept" to begin the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
6.  **Verify result:** After a few seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, right-click on the newly created `.rar` file and check its properties to confirm the reduced size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. A 55.6 megabyte video, for example, can be compressed to around 43.9 megabytes, a reduction of about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Other Methods for File Sharing

While WinRAR is effective for [[benefits_of_reducing_file_size_for_sharing | reducing file size for sharing]] via email, other options exist for sending large files:

*   **VLC Media Player:** Another video compression method uses VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Cloud Storage Services:** Services like [[using_mega_for_file_sharing | MEGA]] (for [[uploading_files_to_mega | uploading files to MEGA]]) or [[sharing_files_using_mediafire | Mediafire]] (for [[how_to_upload_files_to_mediafire | uploading files to Mediafire]]) are common alternatives for sharing files too large for email.
*   **Private YouTube Videos:** [[emailing_private_youtube_video_links | Emailing private YouTube video links]] can be an option for sharing video content without attaching the file directly.
*   **Outlook:** For email management, [[editing_and_modifying_sent_emails_in_outlook | editing and modifying sent emails in Outlook]] is a feature, and for timed communications, [[important_considerations_for_scheduled_emails | important considerations for scheduled emails]] should be noted.
*   **Gmail:** In Gmail, [[creating_folders_in_gmail | creating folders in Gmail]] can help organize messages.

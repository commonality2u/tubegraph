[[features_and_benefits_of_revolut | Revolut]] is a platform known for its features, especially for facilitating international money transfers with competitive commission structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The platform allows users to send money globally instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

## Commission Structure for International Transfers

While Revolut states there are "no hidden commissions," this does not mean there are no commissions at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The specific charges depend on the account type and the amount being transferred:

*   **Commission-Free Threshold**: The first 1,000 euros (or equivalent in another currency) sent to another bank account in a different country are typically commission-free with Revolut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Standard plan]] includes 1,000 pounds in free conversions per month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Exceeding the Threshold**:
    *   For [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Standard account]] holders, transfers exceeding 1,000 euros (or equivalent) will incur a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Premium]] and [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Metal account]] holders are not charged commissions for transfers that exceed this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   The [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Plus]] and [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Standard plans]] allow one free international transfer per month, with subsequent transfers costing 0.50 pounds each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Real Exchange Rates**: Revolut offers the real exchange rate for transactions abroad in over 150 currencies without additional hidden charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Example Transfer Scenario

If a user with a [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Standard account]] wants to transfer 2,000 pounds from an English account to a Spanish account, this amount exceeds the 1,000-euro commission-free limit for [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Standard users]]. In such a case, a commission would be applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, for [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Premium]] and [[revolut_account_types_and_plans | Metal account]] users, such transfers would remain free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This flexibility makes Revolut particularly beneficial for those who frequently send larger sums across borders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

> "The interesting thing is to make payments if you have a standard account less than one thousand euros and obviously if, for example, you are going to make larger payments or transfers amount to a bank account with a different currency because obviously yes it pays to make an account premium or a metal account that is very important, I think this is one of the greatest benefits that the I revoluted so well it's super important Keep that in mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>

## Making an International Transfer

To initiate a transfer, users can input the amount and the destination country, and Revolut will display any applicable commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The process often involves entering a phone number on the Revolut website to receive an SMS with a link to download the [[overview_of_revolut_app_features | Revolut app]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, as the platform is heavily mobile-centric <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Account setup also includes verification steps like providing personal details and taking a selfie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

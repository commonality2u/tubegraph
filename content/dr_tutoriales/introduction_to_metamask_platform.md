MetaMask is a platform that allows users to manage and use cryptocurrency tokens within their digital wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It enables the conversion of cryptocurrencies into tokens like USDT and holds them inside your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The process for using MetaMask is consistent whether you are on a computer or a cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Before proceeding, it is assumed that you have already logged into your [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## Adding Tokens to MetaMask

To add tokens such as USDT to your [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] account, you will need to find the token's contract address. This process allows you to [[how_to_add_usdt_token_to_metamask | list the USDT token]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> and have it available for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

### Finding the Token Contract

1.  Open a new application or web page designed to list cryptocurrencies and their existing contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  In the search engine of this platform, type "USDT" or "CECER" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  Once found, open the token's information page to reveal its contract details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Methods to Add USDT Token

There are two primary ways to add the USDT token to your [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] wallet:

#### 1. Manual Addition Using Contract Address

This method requires you to manually input the token's contract address into [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

1.  On the token's information page, copy the contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  Open your [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the section where you can add tokens, often labeled "Import tokens" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
4.  Paste the copied contract address into the designated field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
5.  MetaMask should automatically recognize the token symbol (e.g., USDT) and decimal places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
6.  Confirm the addition, and the USDT token will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

#### 2. Direct Addition via MetaMask Extension Button

If you have the [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] browser extension installed, you might see a "little fox" icon (ðŸ¦Š) next to the contract address on the token's information page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

1.  Click the "little fox" icon (ðŸ¦Š) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  This action will open a [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] notification tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
3.  Once the notification loads, you can confirm adding the token directly to your [[using_metamask_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | MetaMask]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
4.  After refreshing your page, the USDT token should appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Adding the USDT token makes it available to use, convert cryptocurrencies, and withdraw them as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This process of [[how_to_add_usdt_token_to_metamask | importing the USDT token inside the MetaMask platform]] is described as super easy and simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

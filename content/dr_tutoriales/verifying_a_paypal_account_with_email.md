Verifying your PayPal account through email is a crucial step to ensure its correct setup and functionality, especially if you wish to [[creating_a_paypal_account_without_a_credit_card | create a PayPal account without needing to link a debit or credit card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This process confirms your ownership of the email address used during registration.

## Initial Setup and Email Requirement

When setting up your PayPal account, you are required to register with an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This email will later need to be verified to [[paypal_account_setup_for_sending_money | properly create a PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. After providing your mobile phone number for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a> and configuring your profile with your email, full name, and a password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>, you will use this email and password to log into your PayPal account each time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

Even if you choose not to link a debit or credit card immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>, you will still need to confirm your email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>.

## The Email Confirmation Process

To confirm your email address:
1.  Access the official PayPal page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.
2.  Log into your newly created account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
3.  Look for a notification in the bell icon that says "finish setting up your account" or prompts you to confirm your email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
4.  Click on the option to "confirm" the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. This action prompts PayPal to send a confirmation email to the address you provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
5.  Go to your email inbox and open the email from PayPal with the subject "confirm email" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.
6.  Click on the confirmation link provided within the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
7.  A new tab will open, asking you to enter your PayPal password to confirm your identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
8.  After entering your password, your email will be confirmed, and PayPal will check your details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.

## Completing Account Verification

Once this process is complete, you will have a fully confirmed PayPal account using your email, without the immediate [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | necessity of linking a credit or debit card]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. At this point, you can proceed to [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | make payments to other people or businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

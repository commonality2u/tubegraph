Activating comments on your YouTube videos allows for greater viewer interaction, which can significantly benefit your content's visibility and promotion on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Increased interaction, even through negative comments, helps position your videos more prominently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

To activate comments, you must consider three key settings within [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_comments | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Steps to Activate Comments

### 1. Channel-Level Configuration

The first step is to adjust your channel's overall settings in [[youtube_studio_configuration_for_comments | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>:

1.  Navigate to `Configuration` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  Select `Channel` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
3.  Go to `Advanced Settings` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
4.  Ensure that your channel is *not* marked as "created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> If your channel is marked as "created for children," comments will be banned across all your videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. To allow comments, you must select "No, set this channel as not made for kids" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### 2. Video-Specific Audience Setting

The second consideration involves the individual video's audience setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>:

1.  Go to the specific video you wish to enable comments for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  Click on `Details` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
3.  Locate the `Audience` section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
4.  Confirm that the video is *not* set as "content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Similar to the channel setting, if a video is designated as "content created for children," YouTube will automatically block all comments for that video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### 3. Video-Specific Comments and Ratings Setting

The third crucial step is to directly allow comments within the video's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:

1.  While in the video's `Details` page, scroll down to `More options` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  Find the `Comments and Ratings` section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
3.  Select `Allow all comments` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> This setting can also be used to `Disable` comments, preventing viewers from interacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. To encourage interaction, always choose `Allow all comments` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
>
> Content creators often allow all comments and then [[managing_inappropriate_comments_on_youtube | manage inappropriate comments]] or delete disrespectful ones after receiving notifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

By following these three considerations, you can successfully activate comments on your YouTube videos, fostering interaction and potentially boosting your content's reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Activating comments on your YouTube videos allows viewers to interact with your content and each other, which can help [[promoting_interaction_and_engagement_on_youtube | promote your YouTube video]] and improve its positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Even negative comments contribute to interaction and can be beneficial for video visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Checking Comment Status
Comments might be deactivated on a video, appearing as unavailable to viewers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. To reactivate them, three key considerations must be addressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Steps to Activate Comments

To activate comments, navigate to the YouTube Studio for your channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### 1. Channel-Level Settings (Configuration)
The first consideration involves checking the channel's overall configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
*   Go to `Configuration` in YouTube Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   Select `Channel` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   Access `Advanced Settings` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   Ensure the channel is **not** marked as "created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. If it is, comments will be banned across all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Set it to "no" to allow comments on all videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### 2. Video-Specific Settings (Details)
The second consideration involves the settings for the specific video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:
*   Select the video in question and click `Details` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   Check the section regarding "content created for children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   Similar to the channel setting, if the video is marked as "yes, it is content created for children," YouTube will block all comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Set it to "no, it is not content created for children" to enable comments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### 3. Video Comment Options (More Options)
The third consideration is the direct comment setting within the video's options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>:
*   While in the video's `Details`, find and click `More options` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   Scroll down to the `Comments and ratings` section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Select `Allow all comments` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Other options include disabling comments entirely or preventing them from being read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   To encourage interaction, choosing `Allow all comments` is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Comment Moderation
Even when allowing all comments, content creators can still [[comment_moderation_on_youtube | moderate comments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Notifications for comments are received, and inappropriate or disrespectful comments can be deleted to maintain the video's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

By following these three considerations, you can successfully activate comments on your YouTube videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Gmail labels are a useful tool for [[organizing_emails_with_labels | organizing your email inbox]] by categorizing messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They function similarly to [[creating_email_folders_in_gmail | email folders]], allowing you to group related emails together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Accessing Label Settings

To begin organizing your Gmail inbox with labels:
1.  Enter your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Configuration" (Settings) menu, typically found on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  From the different windows that appear, select the "Labels" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Understanding the Labels Window

The "Labels" window displays what appears in the left-hand tray of your Gmail inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This includes default categories like "posts," "important chats," and "sent" emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Any labels you create and choose to show will be visible here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## [[setting_up_new_labels_and_subtags | Creating New Labels]]

To create a new primary label:
1.  In the Labels window, select the option to "create new labels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  Enter a name for your new label, for example, "YouTube" to categorize emails related to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  Click "Create" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## [[setting_up_new_labels_and_subtags | Creating Sub-Labels (Nested Tags)]]

Within a main label, you can create sub-labels for further organization, similar to creating nested folders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>:
1.  When creating a new label, after naming it (e.g., "comments"), select the option "Nest tag in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  Choose the parent label (e.g., "YouTube") from the dropdown list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
3.  The sub-label will appear slightly to the right of the parent label in the settings, indicating it's nested within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   Examples of sub-labels could be "comments" or "clips" under a "YouTube" main label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Managing Existing Labels

*   **Deleting a Label:** To remove a label, click the "delete" option next to its name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Modifying a Label:** To change a label's name or other properties, click the "modify" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying Labels to Emails

Once labels are created, you can [[filtering_and_managing_emails_in_gmail | filter and manage emails]] by applying these labels:
1.  Search for emails related to a specific topic (e.g., "subscription" or "Replay" for comments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
2.  Select all the relevant emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  Right-click on the selected emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
4.  Choose "Tag how" (or "Label as") and select the appropriate label (e.g., "YouTube subscriptions" or "YouTube comments") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
    *   All selected emails will now be associated with that label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## [[using_color_coding_for_email_labels | Using Color Coding for Email Labels]]

To visually distinguish your labels in the inbox:
1.  Go back to the Labels settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
2.  Select a label (e.g., "YouTube") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
3.  Choose a color for that label from the color palette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   You can also apply the same color to all its sub-labels for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
4.  Emails with that label will now appear with the chosen color in your inbox, making it easier to [[prioritizing_and_sorting_gmail_inbox | prioritize and sort]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

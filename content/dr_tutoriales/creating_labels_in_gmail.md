Gmail labels help to [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | organize your inbox]] effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Labels function similarly to folders, allowing you to categorize emails.

## Accessing Label Settings

To begin [[creating_folders_in_gmail | managing email folders in Gmail]], navigate to the label configuration settings:
1.  Enter your Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.
2.  Go to "Configuration" (settings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.
3.  Select the "Labels" window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. This window displays what is visible in the left-hand tray of your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Creating New Labels

To create a new label:
*   In the labels settings, select the option to "create new labels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   For example, you might create a "YouTube" label to categorize all emails related to YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## [[using_sublabels_in_gmail_for_better_organization | Creating Sub-labels]]

Labels in Gmail also support a hierarchical structure, allowing you to create sub-labels within main labels. This helps in more granular [[organizing_gmail_inbox_with_labels | organization]].

1.  While creating a new label, you can select an existing label to "nest tag in" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  For instance, within the "YouTube" label, you could create sub-labels such as "comments" or "subscriptions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
3.  Sub-labels appear indented slightly to the right of their parent label in the sidebar, indicating their nested relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## [[managing_email_folders_in_gmail | Managing Existing Labels]]

You can modify or delete labels as needed:
*   **Delete**: To remove a label, select it and choose the "delete" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   **Modify**: To change a label's name or other properties, select it and choose "modify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying Labels to Emails

Once labels are created, you can apply them to emails:
1.  Search for emails you wish to label (e.g., using a keyword like "subscription") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  Select the desired emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  Right-click on the selected emails and choose "Tag how" (Label as) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
4.  Select the appropriate label (e.g., "YouTube subscriptions") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. All selected emails will then appear under that label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
5.  This is a basic but useful way to [[how_to_organize_gmail_emails_automatically | filter and organize your emails]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## [[setting_colors_for_gmail_labels | Setting Colors for Labels]]

To visually distinguish labels in your inbox:
*   Go to the labels section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   Select a label (e.g., "YouTube") and choose a color for it, such as red <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   You can also apply the same color to its sub-labels for consistency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Emails with the colored label will then appear with that color in your inbox <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

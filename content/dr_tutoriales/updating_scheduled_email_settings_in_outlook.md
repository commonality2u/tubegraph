Outlook allows users to modify the settings of emails that have already been scheduled for delivery. This includes changing the delivery date and time, or setting an expiration date for the scheduled delivery.

## Accessing Scheduled Emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>

To update a scheduled email, first, you need to access it.
1.  Navigate to the "Messages part" in Outlook, specifically the "Outbox" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
2.  Here, you will see a count of pending messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
3.  Click on the scheduled email to open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. This will display the mail that has been scheduled, for example, on a specific date and time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

## Modifying Delivery Date and Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>

Once the scheduled email is open:
1.  Go to the "Options" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
2.  Select "[[delaying_email_delivery_in_outlook | Delay Delivery]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
3.  In the delivery options, you can change the desired delivery date and time for the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
4.  After making the changes, click "Close" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
5.  Finally, click "Send" again to update the [[scheduling_emails_in_outlook | schedule]] of the email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. This action ensures the new delivery time is applied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Setting an Expiration Date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>

In addition to delaying delivery, you can also set an expiration date for the scheduled email. This is useful if you want the email to be cancelled or not sent if it hasn't been delivered by a certain date.
*   Under "Options," there is an "[[setting_email_expiration_in_outlook | Expires]]" setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   This setting dictates that if Outlook has not been opened by the specified expiration date, the email will not be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

### Important Consideration for Scheduled Emails

> A crucial point to understand for [[important_considerations_for_scheduled_emails | scheduled email delivery]] in Outlook is that the email will *only* be sent if Outlook is open on your computer at the scheduled delivery time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. If Outlook is not running, the email will not be sent, even if it has been scheduled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. This is a known limitation of Outlook's scheduling feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

Contacting Facebook support can seem complicated, but it is possible to initiate a chat with their company support service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This guide outlines the [[steps_to_solve_facebook_account_issues | steps to solve Facebook account issues]] by accessing their business help service.

## Initial Steps to Contact Support

To begin, access the Facebook help link, which is typically found in the first comment of associated video tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. If you have questions or need further clarification, you can leave comments or contact the tutorial creator via Instagram <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Navigating to Business Help

The general Facebook help page often leads to various questions without direct support contact options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. To bypass this, you need to navigate to the [[using_facebook_business_help_service | Facebook business help service]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

*   **Creating a Business Account (if needed)**: If you haven't created a company business account, you can quickly do so using your existing Facebook profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This is a simple process and does not require extensive setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Accessing Support Through "First Steps"

Once in the Business Help section, look for options that lead to direct support.
*   Click on "First steps" or "Get in Service with the service contact of attendance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   This section will display an overview of your Help Account for businesses, including recent and resolved account problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Initiating Contact with Support

Within the business help account overview, locate "If I need them Help" and select "contact the service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Selecting a Problem Category

When prompted to state your problem, you might be redirected to another website if your specific issue isn't listed directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. To ensure you can proceed to chat, choose a specific problem, even if it's not directly related to your actual issue. A recommended option is "I think someone You have accessed my company without permission" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. You can explain your true problem to the support agent later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### Providing Information

Once you select a problem category, you will be asked to [[providing_information_to_facebook_support | provide information to Facebook support]] to initiate the chat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Starting the Chat

After filling in the required information, click "initiate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This will show an estimated wait time before you can "Start chat" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

Finally, click "Start chat" to open the [[initiating_a_chat_with_facebook_company_support | Facebook Company Chat]] window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. You will then wait for a Facebook support agent to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

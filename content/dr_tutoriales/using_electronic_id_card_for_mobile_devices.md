To use your electronic ID card (DNIe) and its associated digital certificates on a mobile device, a crucial prerequisite is to first [[steps_to_embed_digital_certificates_onto_a_mobile_phone | embed the digital certificates onto a computer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Without completing this initial step, you will not be able to transfer the certificate to your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Mobile Device Requirements

*   **iPhone (iOS)**: The NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna is already activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. This antenna is used for functions like mobile payments in establishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. No additional management is required on the device for this feature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Android**: You will need to manually activate the NFC antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Installing the Digital Certificate Application

1.  **Download the App**: Search for "Digital certificate" or "TNF" in your mobile device's app store (e.g., App Store for iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
2.  **Verify Creator**: Ensure the application's creator is "certified digital FNT" to guarantee data security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  **Open the App**: Once downloaded, open the application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Steps to Obtain and Install the Certificate

Inside the app, you will have options to request or manage digital certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The primary method for this process involves [[using_an_id_card_reader_con_electronic_dnie | reading the chip of your DNIe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

1.  **Accept Terms**: Accept the terms and conditions within the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
2.  **Enter Email**: Provide your email address for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. A verification code will be sent to your email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
3.  **Enter CAM Code**: Input the CAM code found on your physical DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
4.  **Enter PIN**: Enter the PIN associated with your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. If you need to renew your DNIe or obtain a PIN, you might need to visit a police station. Information on [[steps_to_obtain_a_dnie_code | how to activate and install electronic DNIe]] is available in a referenced video tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
5.  **Read the DNIe Chip**: Place your DNIe on a smooth surface and place your phone (without a case) on top of it, ensuring the DNIe chip is near the top of your mobile phone where the antenna is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. The phone will detect the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
6.  **Confirm Request**: Confirm the request for the Citizen's Certificate issued by the National Factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

8.  **Install on Device**: Click to install the certificate on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
9.  **Create Password**: Set a password for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
10. **Download Profile**: Allow the website to download a profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
11. **View and Install Certificate Profile**:
    *   Navigate to "View Certificate installed" or "Settings" to find the downloaded profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. On iPhone, this might be under VPN & Device Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   Tap "Install" on the profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Enter your device's passcode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
    *   Enter the password you created for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

Your digital certificate will now be installed and active on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

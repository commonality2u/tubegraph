5.  Enhance quizzes by adding images to make them more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### Memes in Quizzes

## Sharing Tests with Students
After creating a test, you can share it with your students in a few ways:

### Assigning to Classes

For example, you can schedule a test to be assigned on May 14th at 12:00 PM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Students in the assigned class will receive notifications at the set time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### Sharing a Practice Link
For immediate access or practice, you can share a practice link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. This link can be copied and pasted to send to students, allowing them to access and play the quiz whenever they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

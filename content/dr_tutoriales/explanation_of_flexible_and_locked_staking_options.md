Decentralized Finance (DeFi) staking on platforms like Binance allows users to earn profitability on their cryptocurrencies. It is found within the "high quality products risk" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. While Binance acts as a service platform for these projects, it's crucial to understand that it does not guarantee consistent operation or profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Understanding DeFi Staking

DeFi is inspired by blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin's underlying system, where multiple entities hold copies of transactions, meaning no single central source controls it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Although many consider DeFi the future of finance, it's important to note that it's not a very safe product and exposes users to [[risks_and_profitability_of_cryptocurrency_staking | high risk]], despite offering the potential for significant profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. It is recommended to start with a small amount of capital to gain experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Flexible vs. Locked Staking

When engaging in [[how_staking_defi_works_on_binance | DeFi staking]], users encounter different options, primarily based on the duration their capital is committed. The key columns to observe are annual profitability, duration, and the minimum locked amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### Flexible Staking

Flexible staking, referred to as "flexible lock" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>, allows users to deposit their cryptocurrencies and remove them at any time they wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This option provides liquidity and control over funds. This is similar to [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings on Binance]] and falls under the [[benefits_of_flexible_vs_locked_savings | benefits of flexible vs locked savings]].

### Locked Staking

Locked staking, or "DeFi blocked" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>, requires users to commit their cryptocurrencies for a specific duration, such as 7 or 30 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>. Generally, the longer the period capital is blocked, the higher the potential profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. However, this is not always the case; some instances may show the same annual return for different locked durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

The investment amount usually has a minimum and a maximum limit, which can vary based on the chosen duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

## Risks and Profitability

When subscribing to a DeFi staking project, Binance explicitly states it is not responsible for losses incurred due to the vulnerability of the project's contract on the corresponding blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. It is crucial to research and inform oneself about the specific project and cryptocurrency involved, as some projects have disappeared due to contract vulnerabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.

The Annual Percentage Yield (APY) in DeFi staking is not a fixed value; it adjusts daily based on chain rewards and can fluctuate. This means profitability is not always positive and can sometimes be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Managing Investments

After investing, users can view their staked assets by navigating to the "wallet" section, then "Earn", and finally the "DeFi" product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Here, options are available to view either flexible or locked investments, allowing users to track their cumulative profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. If an investment is flexible, it can be removed instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. For locked investments, removal is only possible after the locked period ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>.

Before proceeding with any investment, it is mandatory to accept and read the agreement for the specific DeFi product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

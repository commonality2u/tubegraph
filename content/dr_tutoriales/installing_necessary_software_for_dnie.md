This guide outlines the steps to [[configuring_your_computer_for_dnie_use | configure your computer]] by installing essential software required to [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | activate and install your electronic DNIe]].

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have your DNIe PIN key. This key is obtained from the police station or automatic machines available there if you don't have it from the day your DNIe was issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. You can use your ID card with these machines to register and obtain the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

> [!NOTE] More detailed instructions on [[steps_to_obtain_a_dnie_code | obtaining a DNIe code]] can be found in a separate tutorial linked in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Downloading Required Software

You will need two main software components, which can typically be found via links provided in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. These are from the government headquarters and for the electronic signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Determine Your System Architecture (64-bit or 32-bit)

Before downloading, identify if your Windows operating system is 64-bit or 32-bit, as this determines which version of the software to install <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

1.  Open File Explorer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  Navigate to "This PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  Your system type (e.g., "64-bit operating system") will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Download Steps

1.  **Electronic Signature Software (FNMT Configurator):**
    *   Access the link for the electronic signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
    *   Select the version compatible with your operating system (e.g., "Windows Sixty Browser and four bits" for 64-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
    *   Click to download the latest version (e.g., 1.8.2 for self-signature) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Installation Process

### 1. Install the FNMT Configurator

1.  Locate the downloaded FNMT Configurator installer file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  Run the installer and grant permission by clicking "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
3.  Click "Next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
4.  Accept the conditions to proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
5.  Choose the installation directory (default is usually fine) and begin installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
6.  Once installation is complete, click "Next" and then "Finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

### 2. Install the Electronic Signature Software (Self-Sign)

## Using an ID Card Reader

To [[using_an_id_card_reader_with_electronic_dnie | use your DNIe]] and [[verification_and_installation_process_for_digital_certificates | verify its certificates]], you will need an ID card reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. A compatible reader can be found via an Amazon link in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

### Connecting Your DNIe

1.  Insert your DNIe into the reader, ensuring the chip is correctly positioned to be read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
2.  Connect the reader to your computer via a USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. You should hear a connection sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Verifying Certificates

Once connected, you can verify that the DNIe and its certificates are being read correctly.

1.  Access the verification link, typically provided in the video's first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This link is used in conjunction with the FNMT software you installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
2.  Click on the relevant option (e.g., "Confirm us") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  On the verification page, select "Validate Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
4.  Click "Select Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
5.  The system will prompt you to open the self-signature application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Open it.
6.  The self-signature application will read the electronic certificates stored on your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
7.  You will see a list of certificates associated with your name, including authentication and signature certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
8.  Choose a certificate (e.g., the DNIe signature certificate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
9.  Enter your secret code (PIN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
10. The system will then confirm the certificate is valid, displaying your name, surname, and DNIe details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

This article outlines a method for [[video compression | video compression]] that aims to reduce file size without compromising video quality. This technique is particularly useful for transferring large files via messaging applications like WhatsApp or email, or for simply conserving storage space on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Recommended Tool: VLC Media Player

The primary tool required for this process is VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. VLC is capable of opening, playing, and editing video files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_video_compression_tutorial | Step-by-Step Video Compression Tutorial]]

The following steps detail how to compress a video file using VLC while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining video quality while compressing]]:

1.  **Open Video in VLC**: Begin by opening the video file you wish to compress with VLC Media Player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Access Conversion Menu**: Navigate to the "Media" option in the VLC menu, typically located on the left side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. From there, select "Convert/Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Add Video File**: In the new screen that appears, click "Add" to select the video track for [[video_conversion_process | conversion]] and compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Conversion**: Click the "Convert/Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
5.  **Configure Output Settings**: This is a critical step for preserving quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   **Profile**: Select the profile "H.264 + MP3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   **Access Profile Settings**: Click the "tools" or "options" icon (represented by keys) next to the profile dropdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

    > [!NOTE] Essential Settings for Quality Retention
    > *   **Encapsulation**: Must be set to "MP4/MOV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    > *   **Video Codec**: Ensure it is "H.264" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
    > *   **Bitrate**: Set to "Same as source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
    > *   **Resolution**: Crucially, set the scale to "1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The height and width should be set to "automatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    > *   **Filters**: Do not modify any filter settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
    > *   **Audio**: It is recommended to keep the audio as "original audio" to prevent loss of sound during the [[video_conversion_process | conversion process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

6.  **Save Profile**: After configuring the settings, click "Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
7.  **Choose Export Location**: Specify the destination folder and filename for the compressed video (e.g., "compressed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
8.  **Start Conversion**: Begin the conversion process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
9.  **Monitor Progress**: A loading bar (reproduction bar) will indicate the conversion progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The video will be fully converted once this bar reaches the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Results of Compression

In an example compression of a 1.93 GB HD video, the file size was reduced to 384 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This represents a reduction of almost 50% or more than 150% compared to the original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Crucially, the video retained good quality and its audio played correctly after compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

Integrating videos into PowerPoint presentations can significantly enhance engagement and information delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"></a>. This tutorial outlines how to import videos, whether they are hosted online or stored on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08"></a>.

## Getting Started
Before importing, ensure you have a PowerPoint presentation ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17"></a>. For instance, you might want to introduce a video into a slide for a final degree project presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26"></a>. It is recommended to add a new slide specifically for the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30"></a>.

## Insertion Method
To insert a video, navigate to the "Insert" tab and select the "Video" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39"></a>. PowerPoint provides two main options for video insertion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>:

### 1. [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | Inserting Online Videos]]
This option allows you to embed videos directly from online sources, such as [[using_youtube_videos_in_powerpoint | YouTube]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>.

**Steps:**
1.  Go to "Insert" > "Video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47"></a>.
2.  Select "Online Video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.
3.  Paste the URL of the video (e.g., from a [[using_youtube_videos_in_powerpoint | YouTube]] channel) into the provided field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>.
4.  Click "Insert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14"></a>.

**Important Note:** For [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | online videos]] to play directly within your presentation, an active internet connection is required during the viewing of the presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25"></a>. Without an internet connection, the [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | YouTube]] video will not be viewable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19"></a>.

### 2. [[adding_videos_from_a_computer_to_powerpoint | Adding Videos from a Computer]]
This method allows you to import videos stored locally on your device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39"></a>.

**Steps:**
1.  Go to "Insert" > "Video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46"></a>.
2.  Select "Video on My PC" (or similar wording like "video computer") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50"></a>.
3.  Browse and choose the desired video file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51"></a>.
4.  Click "Insert" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00"></a>.

**Advantage:** Unlike [[inserting_online_videos_in_presentation_slides | online videos]], videos inserted directly from your computer can be viewed at any time without the need for an internet or Wi-Fi connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12"></a>. These videos also offer different formatting and playback options, such as setting them to start automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07"></a>.

This tutorial outlines the steps to withdraw your cryptocurrency or money from Coinbase to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Before proceeding, it's important to note that you cannot directly withdraw cryptocurrencies like Polygon Matic to a traditional bank account such as Santander, Sabadell, or N26, as they are not considered legal tender that can be stored in banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Therefore, the first step is always to convert your cryptocurrency into fiat money (conventional currency like Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Money

To begin the withdrawal process, you must convert your cryptocurrencies into a fiat currency like Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

1.  **Navigate to Sell Option**: Go to the "operating" and "selling" section within Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
2.  **Search for Crypto Asset**: Use the search engine to find the specific crypto asset you wish to sell, for example, "Matic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Sale**: Click on the asset, then select "buy" and from the subsequent menu, choose "sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Sale**: You will see the option to sell the entire amount. The system will display the wallet (e.g., euros), transaction commissions (e.g., one euro for selling 2.76 Matic), and the total disbursement you will receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Commissions for selling crypto on Coinbase can be high (e.g., one euro for selling 2.76 Matic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For lower operating commissions, consider using Coinbase Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Withdrawing Fiat Money to Your Bank Account

Once your cryptocurrency has been converted to fiat currency (e.g., Euros), you can proceed with the withdrawal to your bank account.

1.  **Access Euro Section**: Go to the "Euro" section of your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  **Select "Withdraw Funds"**: On the right side, you will find the "withdraw funds" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
3.  **Enter Amount**: Input the amount you wish to withdraw, for example, 50 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
4.  **Choose Withdrawal Method**:
    *   **Debit/Credit Card**: You can add a debit or credit card. However, this method incurs commissions of approximately 1.5% to 2.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Bank Account**: You can add another bank account if you don't already have one linked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The commission for a bank transfer is typically 0.15 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
    *   **PayPal**: Withdrawing to PayPal is generally free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Withdrawal**: Select your preferred withdrawal method and click "continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Transfer Time and Confirmation

*   **Bank Transfer**: If you choose a bank transfer, the funds typically arrive in your bank account within one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   **PayPal Transfer**: PayPal transfers also usually take about one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Email Confirmation**: You will receive an email confirmation to the address associated with your Coinbase account, confirming the withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

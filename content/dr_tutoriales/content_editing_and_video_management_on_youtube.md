This tutorial provides guidance on [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | uploading videos]] to the YouTube platform and managing their content and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It also offers general tips for channel growth, subscriber gain, and increasing views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Accessing YouTube for Uploads

To begin, access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. You must have a YouTube channel created, which can be done if you have a YouTube account associated with Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Once on the platform and logged into your channel, navigate to [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Uploading Videos

Within [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]], there are a few ways to initiate an upload:
*   Look for an arrow icon, which indicates the upload function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.
*   Click the "Create" button, which also presents the option to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | upload videos]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   You can also choose to broadcast live from this section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Once you click to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | upload videos]], you will need to select a computer file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This can be done in two ways:
*   **Dragging the video** directly onto the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Selecting the file** through a file browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

After selection, the video will begin to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | upload]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Content Editing Process

Once the video begins uploading, you enter the content editing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This is where you can define various aspects of your video:
*   **Title** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
*   **Description** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>
*   **Thumbnail** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   **Playlists** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> (e.g., [[creating_playlists_and_video_collaborations_on_youtube | Creating playlists and video collaborations on YouTube]])
*   **Cards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>

After setting these details, click "next" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Video Management and Visibility

Upon successful upload, the video will appear in your list of uploaded videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. You can access this list by navigating to the "Videos" section on the left-hand side in [[youtube_studio_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

When a video is uploaded, YouTube processes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. During this processing, YouTube checks for:
*   **Copyright rules violations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   **Compliance with requirements and censorship rules** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>, ensuring the content is appropriate for the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

By default, the visibility for uploaded videos is often set to "Public" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For videos to be viewable by others, they must be public and have no restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

You can change the visibility of your video at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> by selecting options such as:
*   **Public**: Viewable by anyone.
*   **Hidden (Unlisted)**: Accessible only via a direct link.
*   **Private**: Only viewable by you and selected users (e.g., [[creating_private_videos_on_youtube | Creating private videos on YouTube]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

To further edit a video's features after it's uploaded, go to its "details" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Duplicate Video Files
It is not possible to [[uploading_videos_and_live_broadcasting_on_youtube | upload]] the exact same video file twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If you attempt to upload a duplicate, the processing will be interrupted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

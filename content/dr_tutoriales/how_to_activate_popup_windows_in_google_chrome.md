This tutorial explains how to easily enable and manage pop-up windows within [[Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Accessing Chrome Settings

To begin, open the [[Google Chrome]] browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Then, navigate to the configuration section, typically located at the top right of the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Click on this section to open the settings menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Once in the main configuration, click on "Advanced settings" to reveal more detailed menus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Navigating to Site Settings

There are two primary ways to reach the pop-up settings:

1.  **Using the Search Bar**: In the settings search engine, type "emerging" (referring to pop-ups), and the "site configuration" section will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This directly leads to the [[configuring_site_settings_for_popups_in_chrome | site configuration]] options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Manual Navigation**: From the advanced settings, go to the "Privacy and security" section on the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Within this section, click on "Site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Enabling Pop-ups and Redirects

Inside "Site configuration," locate the option for "Pop-ups and redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. By default, this setting might be configured to "not allow sites to send windows emerging or use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

To enable pop-ups, click on this option and change the setting to "Allow sites to send pop-ups and use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This will permit all sites to display pop-up windows and manage redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Managing Specific Site Permissions

Even with pop-ups generally enabled, you can manage them for individual websites.

### Blocking Specific Sites

You have the ability to [[blocking_specific_sites_from_sending_popups_in_chrome | block specific sites]] from sending pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

### Example: Blocking YouTube Pop-ups

For instance, if you wish to prevent [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | YouTube]] from sending pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, you can add "www.youtube.com" to the block list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. After adding it, [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | YouTube]] will no longer send pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This allows for granular control over which pages can send pop-up windows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Summary of Pop-up Options

In summary, [[Google Chrome]] provides options to:
*   Activate pop-up windows for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Deactivate pop-up windows for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Have pop-ups activated only for specific pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

To embed your electronic ID card and associated digital certificates on your mobile device, specific steps and prerequisites must be met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Prerequisites
Before attempting to install digital certificates on a mobile phone, they must first be installed on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This initial step is indispensable; attempting the mobile installation without completing the computer-based embedding will not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A tutorial on this preliminary step is available in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Compatibility and NFC
While the user interface of applications may differ between Android and [[iOS | iOS]], the core process for installing digital certificates is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For Android devices, the NFC (Near Field Communication) antenna needs to be activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. On [[iOS | iOS]] devices like the iPhone, the NFC antenna is already active <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This antenna facilitates functionalities such as making payments in establishments using the mobile phone, provided your card is in Apple Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Application Requirements
To proceed with the installation on an iPhone, no specific management is required outside of downloading the necessary application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Finding and Downloading the App
1.  Navigate to the [[App requirements for managing digital certificates on iPhone | App Store]] on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
2.  Search directly for "Digital Certificate" or "DNI" (Electronic ID card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
3.  Ensure the application's creator is "certified digital FNT" to guarantee its authenticity and security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This verification helps protect your data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Verification and Installation Process
Once the application is downloaded, open it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Requesting the Digital Certificate
1.  Inside the app, select the option to "Request the certificate digital" or manage existing certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
2.  The application offers several methods for obtaining the certificate:
    *   A video identification service (which may incur a cost) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
    *   Applying in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   Reading the chip of your electronic ID card (DNI E), which is the method demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
3.  Click "next" and choose to read the ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
4.  Accept the terms and conditions presented by scrolling down and tapping "accept and continue" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
5.  Enter your email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
6.  Check your email for a verification code and enter it into the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
7.  Enter the CAM code found on your physical DNI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
8.  Input the PIN associated with your DNI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This PIN is typically set when renewing your DNI or can be obtained at a police station, as explained in a separate video tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.

### Reading the DNI Chip
1.  Place your ID card on a smooth surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
2.  Place your iPhone (without a case) near the top of the ID card to detect the chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This area is believed to be where the NFC antenna is located <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
3.  Confirm the request for the Citizen's Certificate issued by the National Factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
4.  The app will confirm that your certificate has been successfully requested and will take a few minutes to validate your application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. You will receive a notification when it's available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

4.  Create a password for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
5.  Proceed to download the digital certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Allow the download when prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

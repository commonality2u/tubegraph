This guide explains how to install your electronic ID card (DNI) and associated digital certificates on your iPhone or mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Installation

Before attempting to embed a digital certificate on your mobile phone, it is indispensable to have already embedded it on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The digital certificate must first be installed on the computer, as the mobile device acts as a container for this certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If this preliminary step is not completed, you will not be able to proceed with the mobile installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> A separate tutorial detailing the process of embedding the certificate on a computer is available and is a mandatory step before proceeding with mobile installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Device Compatibility

While the overall process is similar for both Android and iOS apps, there are minor differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For Android, you need to manually activate the NFC antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. On iPhones, the NFC antenna is already activated, enabling functions like mobile payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Therefore, no additional management is required for NFC on iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Application Download and Verification

To begin, you will need to download a specific application.

1.  Open the App Store on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
2.  Search directly for "TNF" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
3.  Locate and download the "Digital Certificate" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> It is crucial to verify that the application's creator is "certified digital FNT" to ensure data security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

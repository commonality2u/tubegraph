This tutorial explains how to block and, more importantly, [[how_to_unlock_the_keyboard_in_windows_10 | unlock the keyboard]] on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The methods described are applicable to Windows 7, Windows 8, and Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This information is particularly useful if the keyboard has been locked accidentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## How to Block the Keyboard (Activating Filter Keys)

The keyboard can be intentionally or accidentally blocked by activating a feature called "Filter keys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. When activated, these filters prevent the keyboard from functioning correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

To activate Filter Keys and block the keyboard:
1.  Locate the `Shift` key on your keyboard, specifically the one located beneath the `Enter` key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Press and hold this `Shift` key for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
3.  After eight seconds, the computer will emit a sound, and a screen will appear asking if you want to turn on "Filter keys of Windows Ten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
4.  The default option presented is usually "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. If you select "Yes," the keyboard will become non-functional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> This method utilizes [[using_windows_filter_keys_to_lock_the_keyboard | Windows Filter Keys to lock the keyboard]]. Before blocking the keyboard, the system allows normal typing, as demonstrated by writing text in a `.TXT` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## How to Unlock the Keyboard (Deactivating Filter Keys)

If your keyboard has been blocked, whether intentionally or accidentally, you can restore its functionality by deactivating the Filter Keys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

To [[disabling_filter_keys_to_restore_keyboard_functionality | disable filter keys to restore keyboard functionality]]:
1.  Press and hold the same `Shift` key (under the `Enter` key) for another eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  The computer will again emit a sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
3.  After this, the keyboard will be reactivated, and you will be able to type freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

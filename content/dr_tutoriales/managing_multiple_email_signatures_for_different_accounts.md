Outlook allows users to [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | create and modify email signatures]], as well as manage multiple signatures for different email accounts and purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This flexibility enables users to assign specific signatures for new messages, replies, and forwarded emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Accessing Signature Settings

To manage your email signatures in Outlook:
1.  Open Outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Options" menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
3.  Select the "Mail" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
4.  Locate and click "Signatures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This option allows you to create or modify signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Creating New Signatures

Within the Signatures window, you can [[creating_and_modifying_signatures_in_outlook | create a new signature]] by:
1.  Clicking the "New" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  Providing a name for the new signature (e.g., "Subscribe" or "Dale a like") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  Clicking "OK" to confirm the name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Designing Your Signature

After naming, you can design the content of your signature:
*   You can [[adding_images_and_text_to_email_signatures | import images]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   You can [[adding_images_and_text_to_email_signatures | insert text]] and format it as desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   A signature can include elements like your name, company logo, email address, and phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
*   It's important to save your changes once the signature is designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

## Configuring Signature Defaults for Email Accounts

Outlook allows you to choose which signature to use for different email accounts and message types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
1.  **Select the Email Account**: If you have multiple email accounts configured in Outlook, choose the specific account for which you want to set the signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  **New Messages**: In the dropdown menu, select the signature you want to automatically apply to new emails <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
3.  **Replies/Forwards**: You can also [[configuring_signatures_for_replies_and_forwarded_emails | configure a different signature for replies and forwarded emails]], or choose not to use a signature for these types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
4.  Confirm your choices by clicking "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Once configured, the chosen signature will automatically appear when you compose a new email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, or when you reply to or forward an email, depending on your settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## How to Compress PDFs with I Love PDF

[[online_pdf_editing_platforms_like_i_love_pdf | I Love PDF]] is an online platform that provides various tools for managing PDF documents, including [[pdf_compression_techniques | compressing PDF]] files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Step-by-Step Guide
1.  **Access I Love PDF**: Navigate directly to the [[online_pdf_editing_platforms_like_i_love_pdf | I Love PDF]] website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
2.  **Select Compress PDF Tool**: From the available options, choose the "Compress PDF" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  **Upload Your PDF**: Click to select the PDF file you wish to compress from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. For example, a file initially weighing approximately 7.82 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
4.  **Choose Compression Level**: [[pdf_compression_techniques | I Love PDF]] offers different compression options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>:
    *   **Extreme compression**: Achieves the smallest file size but may significantly reduce quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
    *   **Recommended compression**: Provides a balanced reduction in size with good quality retention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Low compression**: Offers the least reduction but maintains the highest quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
    The more you compress, the less quality the file will have, as quality is sacrificed for size reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
5.  **Initiate Compression**: Click the "Compress PDF" button to start the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
6.  **Download Compressed PDF**: Once completed, the platform will display the compression results and allow you to download the newly compressed PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Compression Results and Quality
In an example using "Recommended" compression, a PDF initially weighing 7.82 MB was reduced to 1.76 MB, representing a 78% reduction in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For documents primarily consisting of text and some images, the quality loss may be minimal even after significant compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Choosing "Extreme compression" would result in an even smaller file size, though with a greater impact on quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

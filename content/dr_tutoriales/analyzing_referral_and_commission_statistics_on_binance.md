## Accessing the Referral Program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>

To access the referral section:
1.  Navigate to your profile on the main Binance account page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
2.  Hover the mouse over your profile icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:32">[01:05:32]</a>.
3.  Select the "Referral Program" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:21">[01:09:21]</a>.

On mobile, open the Binance application, go to your profile, and select the "Referral Program" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>.

## Understanding Referral Benefits and Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:90">[01:13:90]</a>

The Binance referral program allows users to [[how_binance_referrals_work | invite friends to earn cryptocurrencies together]], with the inviter earning up to 40% commission on the friends' trading activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:90">[01:13:90]</a>.

### Benefits for Referred Users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>
When a new user creates an account using a referral link, they can receive a 10% discount on commissions for deposits, operations, or withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:24">[00:22:24]</a>. This means that 10% of the commissions they would normally pay are returned to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>.

### Benefits for Referrers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>
The referrer receives a percentage of the commissions paid by the referred user <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:75">[01:51:75]</a>. For example, if a referred user gets a 10% discount, the referrer receives that 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. It is recommended to use [[how_binance_referrals_work | Binance referral links]] with people who are known to make investments or trade cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:78">[02:18:78]</a>.

## Referral Program Dashboard Sections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:64">[01:34:64]</a>
The referral program dashboard is divided into several key sections:
*   **Control Panel**: Provides an overview of referral statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:54">[01:35:54]</a>.
*   **List of Links**: Manages different referral links created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:34">[01:37:34]</a>.
*   **Friends List**: Shows a list of referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:04">[01:40:04]</a>.
*   **History of Commissions**: Displays a detailed log of earned commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:60">[01:40:60]</a>.
*   **Shared Commissions**: Reflects the commissions shared with referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:24">[01:43:24]</a>.

## Commission Structure and Percentage Configuration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:50">[02:49:50]</a>

Users can customize the commission percentages for their referral links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:66">[02:50:66]</a>. While a default referral link might give the referrer 10% and the referred person 10% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:20">[02:36:20]</a>, it's possible to create links where the referrer receives 20% and the referred person receives 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:40">[03:40:40]</a>, or vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:11">[02:53:11]</a>.

To generate a new link and choose percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:90">[04:45:90]</a>:
1.  Go to the "Generate a link" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:75">[04:46:75]</a>.
2.  Choose the desired percentage for both the referrer and the referred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:95">[04:49:95]</a>.
3.  Options typically include 0%, 5%, or 10% for the referred person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:95">[04:52:95]</a>.
4.  If the account's Binance Coin (BNB) balance is higher than 500 BNB, users can select 15% or 20% for themselves and 0% for the referred person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:95">[04:55:95]</a>.

The recommended approach is to offer a fair split, such as 10% for the referrer and 10% for the referred, to ensure both parties benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:90">[04:33:90]</a>.

## Referral Statistics and Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>

The control panel provides statistics on referral performance:
*   **Earned Bitcoins**: Shows the total amount of bitcoins earned through referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:60">[02:57:60]</a>.
*   **Transactions Made**: Displays the total number of transactions made by referred users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:70">[03:03:70]</a>.
*   **Total Referrals**: Indicates the number of users who have signed up using your referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   **Classification**: Ranks referrers based on the amount of bitcoins earned from referrals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

## Friends List and Activity Monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:75">[04:51:75]</a>

The "Friends List" section displays users who have opened an account using a referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:75">[04:46:75]</a>. While it does not show personal names, it provides the User ID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:35">[04:54:35]</a>. For each referred user, you can view:
*   **Account Type**: E.g., Spot, Mining, Futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:45">[05:00:45]</a>.
*   **Operations**: What type of operations they have conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:85">[05:01:85]</a>.
*   **Registration Time**: When they registered their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:45">[05:08:45]</a>.
*   **Operation Status**: Whether operations have been carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:55">[05:10:55]</a>.

Binance maintains user privacy by not revealing personal names of affiliated users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:90">[05:22:90]</a>.

## Commission History <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>

The "History of Commissions" section allows users to view detailed records of earned commissions. This can be filtered by account type (e.g., Spot, Futures, Mining) to see specific operating activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   Commissions earned are typically paid in the same cryptocurrency that the referred user traded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. For example, if a referred person buys BNB, the referrer will receive BNB commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. This allows referrers to accumulate various cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.
*   The system allows you to see what specific cryptocurrencies your referred users are buying, such as Polkadot or Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

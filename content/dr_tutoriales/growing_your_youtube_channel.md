To foster the growth of a YouTube channel, it's essential to understand and activate various features, especially for new accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Enabling Longer Videos

New YouTube accounts initially restrict video uploads to under 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. To [[activating_youtube_channel_features | activate]] the ability to upload videos longer than 15 minutes, a phone verification process is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Accessing YouTube Studio Settings

To enable these features:
1.  Access [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] directly from your YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Configuration" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  Select the "Channel" sub-tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
4.  Go to the "Access to functions" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

### Understanding Channel Functions and Permissions

For new channels, certain functions are enabled by default, such as uploading videos, creating playlists, and adding video collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:07">[01:05:07]</a>. However, features like uploading videos longer than 15 minutes, using custom thumbnails, and live broadcasts require phone verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. These [[permissions_required_for_new_youtube_channels | permissions required for new YouTube channels]] become "available" once verification is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Verification Process

To verify your account and enable advanced features:
1.  An option to verify the phone number will be presented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.
2.  Enter your phone number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.
3.  Select your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
4.  Choose your preferred method to receive the verification code (text message or call) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.
5.  Receive a verification code via text message or call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.
6.  Enter the received code to verify your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

Once the phone number has been verified, the account will be enabled to upload videos longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.

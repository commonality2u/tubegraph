## Direct Deposit Methods on Binance

Binance offers two primary ways to deposit funds: fiat currency and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:03">[02:02:03]</a>.

### Fiat Deposits
Fiat currencies are national currencies like EUR, USD, GBP, RUB, and CZK, provided they are accepted by the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:11">[02:11:11]</a>. The available deposit methods and associated commissions can vary depending on the currency and the current market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:24">[02:24:24]</a>.

Common methods include:
*   **Visa/MC Bank Card**: May incur commissions, such as 1.8% for EUR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a> or 18% for GBP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **P2P Bank Transfer**: Often has 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.
*   **Wallet Cash**: 0% commission, though additional fees may apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
*   **SWIFT Bank Transfer**: For USD, this method can have 0% commission and was recently enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **SEPA/Faster Payments**: These methods can be suspended due to regulatory measures in some countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Deposits
[[Depositing fiat and cryptocurrencies on Binance | Depositing cryptocurrencies]] directly into Binance is another option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. While Binance itself doesn't charge a deposit fee for crypto, the cost of sending the crypto depends on the blockchain network used for the transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

## Alternative Platforms for Fiat Deposits and Low-Cost Transfers

A common strategy to achieve [[reducing_binance_commissions | lower commissions]] is to first deposit fiat money into another cryptocurrency exchange platform with low or zero fiat deposit fees, convert it to a low-fee cryptocurrency, and then transfer that cryptocurrency to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.

### Examples of Alternative Platforms

*   **Kraken**: This platform allows fiat deposits (e.g., EUR) via SEPA or SWIFT transfers, often with zero commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Funds typically appear within one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **KuCoin**: KuCoin is another exchange that can facilitate fiat deposits. Its trading fees can be as low as 0.1% for certain user levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
*   **Coinbase**: While Coinbase is considered a secure platform, it can have higher trading costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. However, it offers cheap SEPA transfer deposits, costing around €0.50-€0.75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Cryptocurrency for Transfer

Once fiat is deposited into an alternative platform, it needs to be converted into a cryptocurrency with low transfer fees before being sent to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. The goal is to select a cryptocurrency whose network transaction costs are minimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

*   **Conversion Costs**: Converting fiat (e.g., EUR) to a cryptocurrency on an alternative platform might cost around 0.16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. For a €2,000 deposit, this would be approximately €3.20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>.
*   **Low-Cost Cryptocurrencies for Transfer**:
    *   **Litecoin (LTC)**: Often recommended for its low transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. For example, Kraken charges 0.02 LTC for withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Tron (TRX)**: Another cryptocurrency known for very low transfer costs. Sending TRX can cost as little as $0.10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. For example, a 2 TRX withdrawal from Kraken (the minimum amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

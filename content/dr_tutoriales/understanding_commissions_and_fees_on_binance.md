This article details how commissions and fees are handled on the Binance platform, covering potential discounts, P2P transaction costs, and withdrawal fees.

## Binance Commission Discounts

Users can potentially save on [[reducing_binance_commissions | commissions]] by creating an account using a recommended link. This can provide a 10% discount on [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_commissions | commissions]] for operations, transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits within Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Utilizing such a link can be more profitable in the long run for [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | getting discounts on Binance transaction fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## P2P Transaction Fees

When using the P2P (Person-to-Person) method on Binance, the price for converting cryptocurrency (like USDT) to fiat currency (like USD) might include a slight markup from the advertiser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This acts as their [[exchange_platform_fees_and_commissions | commission]] for facilitating the exchange.

Specific payment methods used in P2P transactions may incur additional costs. For instance, a P2P advertiser might state they cover the PayPal shipping [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]], which is described as 0.54% plus 0.3 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. When selling USDT, the platform will display the total amount you will receive, taking into account any applicable [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Withdrawal Fees

When withdrawing cryptocurrency from Binance to another platform, such as transferring USDT from Binance to Kraken, a network [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | commission]] is charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. For example, withdrawing USDT using the ERC-20 network may incur a fixed network [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commission]] of 10 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

It is important to review the [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_commissions | commission rules]] for withdrawals, as for small quantities, different networks might be more or less profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The fixed nature of some withdrawal fees means that transferring larger quantities of cryptocurrency is often more cost-efficient, as the fixed fee represents a smaller percentage of the total amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

Google Forms provides various functionalities to [[creating_a_survey_using_google_forms | create a survey]] for different purposes, offering customization and advanced options for question types and response management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Accessing Google Forms
To access Google Forms, navigate to the "forms" section, which is typically represented by a purple icon, found by clicking the circle icons on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This will lead directly to the Forms interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Creating a Survey
While you can [[creating_a_form_with_google_forms | create a form]] for general purposes, a survey is often structured differently, focusing on concrete questions and responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Although specific "survey" templates may not explicitly appear, options like "customer feedback" or "event comments" can be similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For surveys, it's common to start with a blank form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Survey Title and Description
Once a blank form is created, you can give it a title, such as "Survey Number One" or "Survey on Belfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. A description can also be added, for instance, "Survey for the final degree project of the psychology course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This description can be formatted using bold or italics for [[how_to_customize_surveys_in_google_forms | personalization]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Previewing the Survey
At any point, you can preview the survey to see how it appears to respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This allows you to check the layout and question presentation before sending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## [[using_different_question_types_in_google_forms | Using Different Question Types]] for Surveys
Google Forms offers [[using_different_question_types_in_google_forms | different ways to answer]] questions suitable for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. While short answer or long paragraph answers are generally not ideal for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, the following types are commonly used:

*   **Multiple Options (Multiple Choice)**: Allows respondents to choose one option from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes**: Enables respondents to select multiple options from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Drop-downs**: Presents options in a compact drop-down menu where respondents select one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Linear Scales**: Useful for evaluating satisfaction or preference on a numerical scale (e.g., 1 to 5), with custom labels for the minimum and maximum points (e.g., "very little" to "much") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Grids (Multiple Choice Grid, Checkbox Grid)**: Allows for questions that require evaluating multiple items against a set of criteria in a grid format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Date and Time**: Can be used to ask respondents when they are filling out the form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## [[managing_survey_responses_in_google_forms | Managing Survey Responses]] and Settings
After creating questions, the survey needs to be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The "Responses" tab allows you to [[managing_survey_responses_in_google_forms | see the answers]] once they are submitted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. The "Configuration" tab offers several [[sharing_and_customization_options_in_google_forms | configuration]] options:

*   **Collect Email Addresses**: You can choose to collect the email addresses of respondents, which can be useful for verifying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Send Copies of Replies**: Allows respondents to receive a copy of their submitted answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This requires collecting email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Allow Response Modification**: You can decide whether respondents are allowed to modify their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Limit to One Response**: This [[mandatory_fields_in_google_forms | limits]] each person to filling out the survey only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Otherwise, people can fill it multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.

### Additional Settings
*   **Convert to Questionnaire**: This option is mainly used for tests, allowing you to assign scores, define correct answers, and provide automatic feedback. It is generally not used for standard surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Form Defaults**: These settings can be saved and applied to future forms, streamlining the creation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Viewing and Presenting Results
The presentation of results and [[how to view responses in Google Forms | how to view responses]] in a concrete way can be explored in future tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

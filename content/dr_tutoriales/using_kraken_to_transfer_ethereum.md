This guide explains how to transfer Ethereum from an external wallet (e.g., Coinbase) to a Kraken account, a necessary step before withdrawing to a bank account. The process is similar across mobile devices (Android, iOS) and computers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Why Use Kraken?

Kraken is preferred over Coinbase for withdrawals to a bank account because Coinbase generally charges higher fees for this type of transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The video suggests that a referral link for Kraken might offer a 20% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Transferring Ethereum to Kraken

The example shown in the tutorial involves transferring $4.16 in Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Steps to Deposit on Kraken

1.  **Access Kraken**: Navigate to the Kraken application or website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Go to Portfolio**: Select the "portfolio" section within Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  **Select Ethereum**: Choose Ethereum from your list of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Deposit**: Click on the "deposit" option for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The deposit will occur via the Ethereum blockchain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
5.  **Copy Deposit Address**: Copy the provided Kraken Ethereum deposit address. The estimated time for the deposit to appear is about 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Steps to Send from an External Wallet (e.g., Coinbase)

In this example, the Ethereum is initially held in a Coinbase wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

1.  **Select Send Option**: In your external wallet, choose the option to send or withdraw Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
2.  **Specify Amount**: Enter the amount of Ethereum you wish to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
3.  **Paste Kraken Address**: Paste the Ethereum deposit address copied from Kraken into the recipient address field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. The system will suggest the correct network (Ethereum blockchain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
4.  **Review and Confirm**: The platform will display the transaction cost and commissions, which in the example ranged from $5.79 to $6.52 USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Confirm the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
5.  **Monitor Transfer**: The transaction will be executed, and the sending platform will show the asset as "sending" and then "carried out correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The Ethereum will no longer appear in your original wallet's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Post-Transfer to Kraken

Once the transaction is complete, the Ethereum will appear in your Kraken account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

> [00:01:42] If you are asked for a large sum of money to withdraw funds, it is likely a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

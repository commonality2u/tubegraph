This tutorial explains how to manage [[activating_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | popup windows]] in Google Chrome, specifically focusing on how to enable, disable, or block them from specific sites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Navigating to Settings

To begin, open your Google Chrome browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Then, go to the "Configuration" section, typically found in the top right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. From there, select [[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | advanced settings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Locating Pop-up Settings

There are two primary ways to find the pop-up settings:

1.  **Using the Search Bar**: In the "search settings" bar, type "emerging" (which refers to pop-ups), and the "site configuration" option will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  **Manual Navigation**: Alternatively, navigate to the [[google_chrome_privacy_and_security_settings | Privacy and security]] section on the left-hand side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Click on "Site configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Within "Site configuration," you will find the "Pop-ups and redirects" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. By default, it is set to "Don't allow sites to send pop-ups or use redirects" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. To change this, click on the option and select your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Enabling it will allow sites to send pop-ups and use redirects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Blocking Specific Sites

Even if pop-ups are generally enabled, you can still [[specific_site_popup_window_blocking | block specific sites]] from sending them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. For example, to block YouTube from sending pop-ups, you can add "www.youtube.com" to the block list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Once added, YouTube will no longer send pop-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This allows for discretion based on which pages you prefer not to receive pop-up windows from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Summary of Options

You have three main ways to manage pop-up windows:

*   Activate pop-ups for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Disable pop-ups for all pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   Keep pop-ups activated only for specific pages, while blocking others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

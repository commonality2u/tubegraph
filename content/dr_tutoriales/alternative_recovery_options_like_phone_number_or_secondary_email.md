This guide outlines methods to recover your [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Gmail account]] or [[recovering_gmail_password | Gmail password]] if you have forgotten them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Important Prerequisite for Recovery

When attempting to recover your account, it is vital to have previously accessed your email account from the computer or mobile phone you are currently using <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Google uses this information as a reference to verify your identity and facilitate recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Recovering a Forgotten Email Account

If you have forgotten your entire email account, not just the password, Google offers several options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>:

### Option 1: [[using_browser_settings_for_email_recovery | Using Browser Settings]]
If you have previously accessed your account from the device, you can check saved passwords and emails in your browser settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
1.  Open a new tab in Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  Go to `Settings` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the `Password` section within `Autofill` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
4.  Search for "gmail" to filter saved accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
5.  Click the "eye" icon to reveal the password; you may be prompted to enter your computer's PIN <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
This method will display the email account and its associated password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Option 2: [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Phone Number or Secondary Email Verification]]
If the browser settings option does not work, or if you don't recall the email account name, you can choose to enter a [[phone_number_verification_for_youtube | phone number]] or a [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | recovery email]] that was associated with the forgotten account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
1.  When prompted, enter the associated [[phone_number_verification_for_youtube | phone number]] or a [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | recovery email]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
2.  Google will send a verification code to the provided [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | recovery email]] or [[phone_number_verification_for_youtube | phone number]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
3.  Follow the steps in the verification message to recover your original account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

> **Recommendation**: Set up a secondary [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Gmail email account]] to use as a recovery email for your primary account to avoid future risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Recovering a Forgotten Password

If you remember your email but have forgotten the password, Google provides several methods to help you regain access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Method 1: [[using_browser_settings_for_email_recovery | Using Browser Settings]]
Similar to recovering a forgotten email, you can check your browser's saved passwords to see if it's stored there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. (See instructions above under "Recovering a Forgotten Email Account: Option 1").

### Method 2: Provide a Previously Used Password
Google may prompt you to enter a password you have previously used for that account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. If recognized, this can allow you to recover your password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Method 3: [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | Secondary Email Verification]]
Google can send a verification email to an associated [[gmail_account_recovery_methods | secondary Gmail account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This process is very similar to recovering a forgotten email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Method 4: Enter Another Email Account for Contact
If no associated recovery email exists, Google allows you to enter any other email account (e.g., a family member's email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Google will use this account to contact you and help recover the password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Method 5: [[google_security_questions_for_account_recovery | Security Questions]]
As a final method, if other options are unavailable, Google may ask you to answer a series of personal [[google_security_questions_for_account_recovery | security questions]] related to your account that you filled in previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Answering these correctly can help recover your account and password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

Google is a powerful server that assists millions of users in recovering forgotten passwords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

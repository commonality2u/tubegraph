By default, YouTube imposes a restriction on video uploads for channels that are not yet enabled for longer durations. Channels without this permission are typically blocked from [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | uploading videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. When attempting to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos with longer duration]] than 15 minutes, the upload may get stuck at 99% processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, indicating a missing permission rather than a YouTube error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Enabling the Permission
To enable the ability to [[uploading_long_videos_on_youtube | upload videos with longer duration]] than 15 minutes, you must enable a specific permission within [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Steps to Enable
1.  **Access YouTube Studio**: Go to the [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]] of the channel where you wish to [[using_youtube_studio_for_video_uploads | upload videos]] longer than 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.
2.  **Switch to Classic Version**: Within [[youtube_studio_interface | YouTube Studio]], select the "classic version" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This can expedite the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
3.  **Navigate to Channel Settings**: In the classic version, click on the "channel" window located in the left panel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
4.  **Locate "Longer Lasting Victims"**: After clicking "channel," various options and permissions for the channel will appear, such as "upload," "monetization," and "direct broadcast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The relevant option for enabling longer videos is labeled "longer lasting victims" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
    *   Normally, a channel without this enabled will show "No" for this option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Verification Process
To activate the "longer lasting victims" permission, you will need to [[verification_process_for_uploading_longer_videos | verify]] your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
*   This verification can be done via computer, Android, or iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   YouTube will send a confirmation code to your mobile phone, Gmail, or registered email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   By entering this confirmation code, you [[verification_process_for_uploading_longer_videos | verify]] that you are the owner of the YouTube account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> Once this permission is enabled, you will be able to [[uploading_videos_longer_than_15_minutes_on_youtube | upload videos with a duration greater than fifteen minutes]] without any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

The process of embedding your [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | electronic ID card (DNIe)]] and its associated digital certificates onto a mobile device requires specific preliminary steps and applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It's crucial to understand that the physical [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] itself is a container; the actual digital certificate must be installed on a computer first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before attempting to embed the digital certificate on your mobile phone, it must be previously installed on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This is an indispensable requirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. A prior video tutorial details this initial embedding process on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Without completing those steps, the mobile installation will not be possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

## Mobile Device Specifics

While the general process is similar, there are slight differences between Android and iOS devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

*   **Android:** You will need to activate the NFC antenna <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.
*   **iPhone:** The NFC antenna is already activated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This antenna allows for contactless interactions, such as payments via Apple Wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. No manual activation is required for iPhones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Application Requirements

To manage [[installing_digital_certificates_on_iphone | digital certificates on an iPhone]], you will need to download a specific application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

*   **App Name:** "Digital certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Finding the App:** Search for "DNIe" in the App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Verification:** Ensure the application's creator is "certified digital FNT" to safeguard your data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## Steps for Obtaining and Installing the Digital Certificate

Once the application is downloaded and opened, you have options to request or manage digital certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The primary method described involves reading the [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] chip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

1.  **Read the [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]]**: Select the option to read the ID card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
2.  **Accept Terms and Conditions**: Review and accept the terms and conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Enter Email**: Provide your email address for verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
4.  **Verify Email**: Enter the verification code received in your email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
5.  **Enter CAM Code**: Input the CAM code found on your physical [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
6.  **Enter [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] PIN**: Provide the PIN associated with your [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This PIN is typically set when renewing or obtaining the [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] at a police station <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
7.  **Scan [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] Chip**:
    *   Place your [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]] on a smooth surface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
    *   Place your phone (without a case) near the [[how_to_activate_and_install_electronic_dnie | DNIe]]'s chip until it's detected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The NFC antenna on iPhones is typically located near the top of the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
8.  **Confirm Request**: Once the chip is read, confirm the request for the Citizen's Certificate issued by the National Factory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
9.  **Await Validation**: The application will validate your request, which may take a few minutes, and you will receive a notification when it's available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
10. **Install on Mobile**:
    *   In the "Pending Requests" section, click to [[steps_to_embed_digital_certificates_onto_a_mobile_phone | install the certificate on the device]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
    *   Accept the terms and conditions for installation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   Create a password for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
    *   Proceed to download the digital certificate profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
11. **Final Device Configuration**:
    *   The downloaded profile needs to be installed in your phone's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
    *   On iPhone, navigate to "VPN & Device Management" to find the downloaded profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
    *   Tap "Install," enter your phone's passcode, and then the password you created for the certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

After these [[steps_to_embed_digital_certificates_onto_a_mobile_phone | steps]], your digital certificate will be installed and active on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. You can then view your installed certificates within the FNT application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

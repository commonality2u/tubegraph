[[peer_to_peer_payments_tutorial | P2P (peer-to-peer) payments]] involve direct transactions between individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This method is fundamentally defined as a [[using_p2p_trading_for_currency_conversion | currency exchange]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. P2P exchanges can often yield more favorable rates compared to traditional bank exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Key Considerations for P2P Currency Exchange

When engaging in P2P currency exchange, several factors should be taken into account:

*   **Price and Commission Graphs**: It's crucial to consider the [[exchange_platform_fees_and_commissions | price and commission graphs]] that apply to the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.
*   **Market Price Comparison**: Always check the current market price of the cryptocurrency you intend to exchange. For example, when [[exchanging_bitcoin_to_national_currencies_like_euros_or_dollars | buying Bitcoin with euros]], compare the P2P offer price to the live market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Prices can vary significantly between different users and are subject to market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Payment Method**: Not all users support every payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Common methods include bank transfers and PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. You can filter offers based on your preferred payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **User Rating and Transaction History**: It is highly important to review the rating of other users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This includes the number of P2P transactions they have completed and their satisfaction rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Users can rate others based on speed, ease, and correct payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. While a high completion rate is good, a slightly lower percentage might not mean non-completion, but rather pending or recent transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

To perform a P2P transaction on a platform like Binance:

1.  **Navigate to P2P Commerce**: Go to the "Buy Crypto" section and select "P2P Commerce" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
2.  **Choose Buy or Sell**: You will see options to either buy or sell coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
3.  **Select Currency**: Choose the currency you are working with (e.g., Euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Then select the cryptocurrency you wish to buy or sell (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  **Enter Amount**: Specify the amount you are willing to spend or receive in your national currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
5.  **Review Offers**: The platform will display a list of users offering to buy or sell, along with their prices and limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
6.  **Transfer Funds to P2P Wallet**: Before initiating a P2P trade, you must transfer the capital you wish to use from your main wallet (e.g., Fiat Spot wallet) to your P2P wallet within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This step is essential for the funds to be available for P2P trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
7.  **Initiate Transaction**: Once you select an offer, a pop-up window will appear displaying the maximum/minimum amounts for the trade, the amount of crypto you will receive, the seller's payment method, and the payment limit time (e.g., 45 minutes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Risks

There is an inherent risk that the other party may not complete the payment correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. Each user assumes this risk when performing P2P payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

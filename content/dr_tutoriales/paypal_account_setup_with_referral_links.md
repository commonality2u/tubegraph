When [[creating_a_paypal_account_without_a_credit_card | setting up a PayPal account]], using a referral link can offer benefits such as bonuses.

## Benefits of Referral Links

If you open a PayPal account using a provided referral link, you may be eligible to receive up to ten euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These links are typically provided in the first comment section of related tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## How to Claim the Referral Bonus

To receive the bonus, you must make a shipment within the PayPal platform after opening your account with the referral link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Essential for Using PayPal: Linking a Bank Account

To facilitate making shipments and depositing funds for them, it's crucial to have a bank account [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked to your PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If a bank account is not [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]] before attempting to deposit funds via transfer, the transaction will be automatically rejected as PayPal won't recognize it as an associated account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

The process of [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linking a bank account]] generally takes one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. PayPal typically sends a small transfer, such as one cent, to your bank account, and you will need to confirm the amount of this transfer within PayPal to complete the [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linking process]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Once your bank account is [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]], you can proceed with making deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. You can use your bank's online services or visit a physical bank to initiate a transfer to your PayPal banking details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. When making the transfer, it's important to include the name of the beneficiary, but no specific concept or memo is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. An email confirmation of the deposit may take one to two working days to arrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

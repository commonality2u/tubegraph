Uploading videos to YouTube can be done in a very simple and easy way, but it's important to understand the steps involved and the checks YouTube performs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Accessing YouTube Studio and Uploading Videos

To begin, you must access the YouTube platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Before uploading, you need to have a YouTube channel created; if you only have a Gmail account, you'll need to create a channel associated with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Once on the YouTube platform, navigate to YouTube Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Within YouTube Studio, locate the upload icon, often represented by an arrow or the "Create" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. From here, you will select a computer file to upload <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

There are two primary methods for uploading a video:
1.  **Dragging the video** file directly to the YouTube platform's upload area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
2.  Clicking "Select file" and choosing the source file from your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Once selected, the video will begin to upload, moving into the content editing process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This process includes [[editing_video_details_after_uploading_to_youtube | editing video details]] like the title, description, thumbnail, and adding the video to playlists or cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. After uploading, the video will appear in your list of uploaded videos, which can be accessed by navigating to the "Videos" section on the left-hand menu in YouTube Studio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## Video Processing and Checks

After a video is uploaded, YouTube processes it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. During this processing, YouTube performs crucial checks to ensure the video complies with its guidelines and regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Copyright Rules and Restrictions
YouTube checks if any copyright rules are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The platform also has censorship rules, meaning not all topics or content are deemed appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. You will be informed if your video has any copyright or other restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Duplicate Content
It is not possible to upload the exact same video file twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. If you attempt to upload a duplicate, the processing will be interrupted, and you will be notified that the file is a duplicate of a video you have already uploaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Video Visibility

By default, the visibility for newly uploaded videos may be set to public, indicating no copyright or other restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. For people to watch your videos, it is essential that the visibility is set to public and that there are no restrictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

You have the option to change the visibility settings for your videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. You can choose from:
*   **Public**: The video is visible to everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   [[setting_video_visibility_to_private | Private]]: Only you and specific people you choose can view the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. [[creating_private_videos_on_youtube | Creating private videos]] is useful for content you only want to share with a select audience.
*   **Unlisted** (referred to as "hidden"): The video is not searchable but can be viewed by anyone with the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Changing these settings can be done within the video details section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

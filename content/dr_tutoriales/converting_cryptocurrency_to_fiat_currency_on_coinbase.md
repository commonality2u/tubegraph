This article outlines the process of [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency | transferring cryptocurrency to fiat currency]] and withdrawing it from a platform like Coinbase to a bank account or PayPal. Cryptocurrencies, such as Polygon Matic, are not considered legal tender and cannot be directly stored in traditional bank accounts [01:50:00]. Therefore, they must first be converted into fiat currency (e.g., Euro) before withdrawal [01:32:00].

## Converting Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency

The initial step is to convert your digital assets into a conventional currency like the Euro [01:57:00].

1.  Navigate to the "operating and selling" section of the platform to [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | convert your coins]] to Euro [02:06:00].
2.  Search for the specific cryptocurrency you wish to convert, such as "Matic" [02:13:00].
3.  Select the asset and choose the "sell" option [02:20:00].
4.  You will be given the option to sell all of your holdings [02:32:00].
    *   For example, selling 2.76 Matic might incur a commission of one Euro [02:34:00].

> To potentially reduce commissions when operating within Coinbase, consider exploring [[depositing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Coinbase Pro]]. A separate video tutorial is available on how to use it for lower fees [02:49:00].

## Withdrawing Fiat Currency to Your Bank or PayPal

Once your cryptocurrency has been converted into fiat currency (e.g., Euros), you can proceed with the withdrawal process [02:59:00].

1.  Go to the "Euro part" of your account and select the "withdraw funds" option [03:10:00].
2.  Enter the amount you wish to withdraw, for example, 50 Euros [03:16:00].
3.  You will be prompted to add a withdrawal method:
    *   **Debit/Credit Card:** You can add a debit or credit card for withdrawal [03:24:00].
        > [!WARNING]
        > This method is generally not recommended due to high commissions, which can be around 21.5% [03:34:00].
    *   **Bank Account:** You can add a bank account for transfer [03:46:00].
        *   The commission for bank transfers is typically 0.15 Euros [03:52:00].
        *   Bank transfers usually take about one to two days to process [04:05:00].
    *   **PayPal:** Withdrawal to a PayPal account is offered as a completely free option [03:55:00].
        *   [[withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_paypal | PayPal transfers]] typically take approximately one day to process [04:14:00].
4.  After selecting your preferred withdrawal method, click "continue" [04:00:00].
5.  You will receive an email confirmation to the address associated with your account, verifying the withdrawal [04:17:00].

## Earning Free Cryptocurrency

The platform also offers a "learn and earn" feature where users can earn cryptocurrencies by completing tutorials and answering questionnaires [01:07:00]. This program allows users to earn free coins, potentially around $60 to $70, by watching videos and filling out questionnaires [01:24:00].

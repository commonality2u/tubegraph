When [[compressing_files_using_winrar | compressing files with WinRAR]], it is important to check the file size before and after compression to ensure the desired reduction has been achieved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This process helps confirm that the file is suitable for purposes like emailing, where size limits apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## How to Check File Size

To check the size of any file on your computer:
1.  Right-click on the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
2.  Select "Properties" from the context menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
3.  The file size will be displayed in the properties window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

## Example: Compressing a Video File

A common reason for [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reducing video file size]] is to facilitate email transfer, as services like Gmail typically have a 25 megabyte attachment limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Initial File Size
In one instance, a video file named "test one" was initially checked:
*   The video file weighed 55.6 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.
*   This size made it too heavy to be transferred via Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>.

### Compression Process
To compress the file using WinRAR:
1.  Right-click on the file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.
2.  Select "Add to archive..." (represented by a book icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.
3.  Configure the compression settings, such as choosing "Best" as the [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | compression method]] and selecting "[[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | Create solid archive]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. While other [[exporting_and_saving_compressed_video_files | video compression method]]s exist, this example focuses on WinRAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
4.  Accept the settings to begin the compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The process takes a few seconds, depending on the file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### Compressed File Size
After compression, the new `.rar` file was checked again using the "Properties" method:
*   The compressed file now weighed 43.9 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   This represented a compression of approximately 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.

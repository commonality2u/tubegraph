This guide explains how to [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | add the USDT token]] to your Metamask wallet, allowing you to use it for cryptocurrency conversions and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The process is similar for both computer and mobile phone applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before proceeding, ensure you are already logged into your Metamask wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. If you need help using Metamask or creating an account, a tutorial is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Finding the USDT Contract

To find the USDT contract address, you will use a dedicated web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
1.  Open a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  Paste the link to the platform (this link is typically provided in the first comment of the video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This web page lists various cryptocurrencies and their existing contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
3.  In the search engine of the platform, type "USDT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
4.  Open the result for USDT to display its contract details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Methods for adding tokens

Once you have located the USDT contract, you can [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | add the USDT token]] to Metamask using two main methods:

### 1. Manual Method

This method involves manually entering the contract address into Metamask:
1.  Go to the Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  If USDT does not automatically appear in the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, you will need to add the contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
3.  On the web page where you found the USDT contract, copy the contract address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. There is usually a "copy" button next to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
4.  Paste the copied contract address into the designated field in Metamask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
5.  Metamask should automatically recognize the token as USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
6.  Confirm the addition, and the USDT token will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### 2. Automatic Method (Using the Metamask Extension Icon)

This method is faster and uses the Metamask extension:
1.  On the web page displaying the USDT contract, look for a small Metamask fox icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This icon is usually next to the contract address, indicating that you have the Metamask extension installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
2.  Click on the fox icon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
3.  A Metamask notification tab will open and load <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
4.  Once loaded, you can perfectly [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | add the token]] to your Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
5.  Refresh the page, and the USDT token will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Once the USDT token is listed, you can use it to convert cryptocurrencies and withdraw them as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This process makes it super easy and simple to import the USDT token into your Metamask platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

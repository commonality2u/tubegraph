Decentralized Finance (Defi) offers a way to potentially earn high profitability on cryptocurrencies, though it also comes with significant risks that investors should understand before committing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Understanding Defi
Defi is inspired by blockchain technology, similar to Bitcoin, which allows multiple entities to hold copies of transactions, meaning it's not controlled by a single central source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. While many believe Defi is the future of finance, it's not considered a very safe product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Profitability and Risks
[[Profitability and risks in Defi | Defi]] can offer high returns, sometimes exceeding 30% or even 100% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. However, it's crucial to understand that Binance, which acts as a platform for Defi, does not guarantee that projects will always work and is not responsible for losses incurred due to the vulnerability of a project's smart contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. The annual percentage yield (APY) adjusts daily based on chain rewards, meaning it's a variable term, and profitability can sometimes be negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

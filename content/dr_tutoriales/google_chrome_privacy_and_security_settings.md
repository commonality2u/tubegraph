This article provides a guide on managing [[blocking_popup_windows_in_google_chrome | pop-up windows]] and redirects within Google Chrome's privacy and security settings.

## Enabling Pop-up Windows in Google Chrome

To activate or enable pop-up windows in Google Chrome:

1.  Open the Google Chrome application. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
2.  Navigate to the "configuration" (settings) section, located in the top-right corner of the browser. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>
3.  Click on "[[google_chrome_advanced_settings_navigation | advanced settings]]". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>

### Locating Pop-up Settings

There are two primary methods to find the pop-up settings:

*   **Using the Search Bar:** In the "search settings" bar, type "emerging" (referring to pop-ups). This will display the "site configuration" option. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>
*   **Manual Navigation:**
    1.  On the left-hand side, select "[[privacy_and_security_settings_on_ios | privacy and security]]". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
    2.  Click on "site configuration". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

### Configuring Pop-up Behavior

Within "site configuration", locate the "pop-ups" setting under "permissions". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> Specifically, find the option labeled "windows emerging redirects". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

*   By default, this setting might be configured to "not allowing" sites to send pop-ups or use redirects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   To enable pop-ups for all sites, click on this option and change it to allow sites to send pop-ups and use redirects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>

### Blocking Specific Sites from Sending Pop-ups

Users also have the ability to block particular websites from displaying pop-ups:

*   Within the same pop-up settings, you can add specific sites to a blocked list. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   For example, to prevent YouTube from sending pop-ups, you can add "WWW.YouTube.com" to the blocked list. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>
*   This allows for granular control, enabling users to permit or block pop-ups based on specific pages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>

In summary, Google Chrome provides options to:
*   Activate pop-up windows for all pages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>
*   Deactivate pop-up windows for all pages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
*   Activate pop-up windows only for specific pages. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>

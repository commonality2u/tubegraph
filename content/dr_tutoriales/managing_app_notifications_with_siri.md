## Siri Announce Notifications

Within the `Notifications` section, you will find settings related to how notifications are displayed (e.g., group, list, or count), which typically apply to general app notifications like WhatsApp [00:00:43] [00:00:50].

    *   To stop Siri from reading notifications aloud, deactivate this option [00:01:08] [00:01:17].
    *   If activated, Siri will announce notifications, especially when `Announce when we have headphones on` is enabled [00:01:12].
4.  You also have the option to allow responses without confirmation [00:01:24] [00:01:26].

## Customizing App Announcements

You can also specify which apps Siri notifies you about when headphones are connected [00:01:29] [00:01:34].
1.  Scroll down within the `Siri, Announce Notifications` section.
2.  You will see a list of applications [00:01:38].
3.  To stop Siri from announcing notifications for a specific app (e.g., "Fever"), simply disable it within this list [00:01:40] [00:01:46] [00:01:49].
By [[customizing_notification_preferences | customizing these preferences]], you can prevent your [[airpods_notification_control | AirPods]] from announcing notifications from certain applications [00:01:50] [00:01:54].

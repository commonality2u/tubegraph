Compressing files using WinRAR is a common method for reducing file size, making them easier to transport or send via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is particularly useful when dealing with email services like Gmail, which has a 25-megabyte attachment limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. By compressing files, you can send a greater number of files in a single email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## [[downloading_and_installing_winrar | Downloading and Installing WinRAR]]

WinRAR is a program that facilitates file compression and decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. If you don't have it, you can easily download it:
1.  Access your preferred search engine (e.g., Google Chrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  Search for "WinRAR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
3.  The first search result typically allows you to download WinRAR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## [[checking_compressed_file_size | Checking Original File Size]]

Before compressing, it's useful to know the original file size.
1.  Right-click on the file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.
2.  Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   For example, a video file might initially weigh 55.6 megabytes, making it too large to send via Gmail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Other compression methods exist, such as using VLC Media Player for video compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Compressing Files with WinRAR

Once WinRAR is installed:
1.  Right-click on the file you want to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  From the context menu, click the icon resembling books, which says "Add to archive..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
3.  This opens the "Archive name and parameters" dialog box.

### [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | WinRAR Compression Settings]]

Within the WinRAR compression dialog, you can configure several options:

*   **Archive Name**: Choose a name for your compressed file. The `.rar` extension indicates it's a compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Compression Method**: Set this to "Best" for maximum compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **Dictionary Size**: Select the smallest possible dictionary size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
*   **Divide into volumes**: Set to "0" to create a single archive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
*   **Compression Options**: Check "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Set password**: You can optionally add a password to encrypt the compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Advanced options**: No changes are typically needed here as compression options are often limited by the source file type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Some file types, like `.mkv` video files, may already be highly optimized and offer minimal additional compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

4.  Click "OK" to begin the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The compression time will vary based on the file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## [[checking_compressed_file_size | Checking Compressed File Size]]

After compression is complete, verify the new file size:
1.  Right-click on the newly created `.rar` file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
2.  Select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
    *   For example, an initial 55.6 megabyte video might be compressed to 43.9 megabytes, representing approximately 20% compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

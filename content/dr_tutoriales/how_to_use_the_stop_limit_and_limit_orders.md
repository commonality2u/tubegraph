This article explains how to use limit and stop-limit orders on the [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | KuCoin]] platform to execute strategic buy and sell orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These order types can simplify trading by allowing you to set specific conditions for transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

To begin, navigate to the "Trade" and "Spot Market" section on the [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | KuCoin]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. The trading interface displays the asset graph, an order book, and sections for recent and open orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The primary area for placing orders is located at the bottom of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Market Order (Overview)

A market order is executed in real-time at the current market value of the cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This means your buy or sell order will process instantly at the price available the moment you click <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Limit Order

A limit order allows you to set a specific price at which you want to buy or sell a cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### How to Place a Limit Order

When placing a limit order, you specify:
*   **Price**: The exact price at which you wish the order to be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: The amount of cryptocurrency you want to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

The order will only be executed if the market price reaches your specified limit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Strategic Use of Limit Orders

You can use the interactive graph on [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | KuCoin]] to identify support and resistance levels, which can inform your limit order prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Buying**: If you anticipate a price drop to a specific support level (e.g., a red line on the chart), you can set a limit buy order at that lower price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. The order will be placed and await the price to reach that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   **Selling**: Conversely, if you expect the price to rise to a resistance level (e.g., a blue line on the chart), you can place a limit sell order at that higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Your asset will be sold if the price reaches that target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Managing Limit Orders

Once placed, open limit orders are visible in the "Open Orders" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This section shows the pair, type (buy/sell), price, and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. You have the flexibility to cancel an open order at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## Stop-Limit Order

The stop-limit order is designed to help reduce risk by allowing for progressive execution of an order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Components of a Stop-Limit Order

A stop-limit order requires two key prices:
*   **Limit Price**: The price at which the order *begins* to execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
*   **Stop Price**: The price at which the order is *fully* executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Quantity**: The desired amount to buy or sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### How a Stop-Limit Order Executes

When the market price reaches your specified **limit price**, the purchase or sale order will start running <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. However, it will not execute 100% immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Instead, a percentage of the order will be executed progressively as the price moves towards the **stop price** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Once the price reaches the stop price, 100% of the order will have been executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

If the price hits the limit price but then moves away before reaching the stop price, only a partial percentage of the order will have been executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The percentage executed depends on how close it got to the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

### Risk Reduction

This order type is crucial for reducing risk in operations, as it prevents losing all capital if the market does not follow the anticipated pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. If the price doesn't reach the stop price, the full order isn't executed, protecting your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Stop-Market Order (Briefly)

The stop-market order is similar to a stop-limit order but executes at the market price instead of a set limit price once the stop condition is met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Like the stop-limit order, it involves a stop price at which the full order will be executed, with progressive execution starting from the market entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Open stop orders are visible in the "Stop Orders" section and can be canceled, even if partially filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

This tutorial explains [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | how to compress video files]] to reduce their size [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | without losing quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is useful for transferring files via services like [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] or email, or to save storage space on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Requirements

To perform video compression, you will need the VLC media player <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

### VLC Capabilities
VLC is primarily used to open and play video files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Additionally, it allows users to edit them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, serving as a [[features_of_a_video_compressor_app | video compressor app]].

## Step-by-Step Compression Process

An example video, a chapter of the "Dark" series downloaded in HD, is used for this demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This particular chapter is 1.93 GB in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, is in 1980 HD, and includes multiple audio tracks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, indicating it's a high-quality file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

1.  **Open with VLC**: Open the video file with VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Navigate to Convert/Save**:
    *   Go to the "Media" menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Select "Convert/Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
3.  **Add File**:
    *   In the new screen, click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Select the video track you wish to convert and compress (e.g., "chapter one of Dark") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
    *   Click "Open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Conversion**: Click the "Convert/Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Configuring Compression Settings

This is the most critical part for [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining quality]] during compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

1.  **Profile Selection**:
    *   Ensure the profile is set to "H.264 + MP3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   Click the "Tools" icon (wrench/spanner) next to the profile dropdown to access options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.
2.  **Profile Settings**:
    *   **Encapsulation**: Must be "MP4/MOV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   **Video Codec**:
        *   Codec: "H.264" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>
        *   Bitrate: "Same as source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
        *   Quality: "Unused" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>
        *   Resolution: Set "Scale" to "1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This is very important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
        *   Filters: Do not touch any filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
        *   Height/Width: Set to "Automatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **Audio Codec**: It is recommended to keep "Audio original" to avoid losing the video's audio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
    *   Click "Save" once settings are configured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

3.  **Export Location**:
    *   Choose the destination where the compressed file will be saved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
    *   Give the new file a name (e.g., "compressed") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   Click "Start" to begin the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

4.  **Monitor Progress**:
    *   VLC will display a progress bar (the reproduction bar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
    *   The conversion is complete when this bar reaches the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Compression Results

After the conversion is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, the original video file, which was 1.93 GB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, is reduced to 384 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This represents a reduction of more than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Upon playback, the audio is still present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, and the video quality remains relatively good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This demonstrates how to shrink video size [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | without losing quality]] or sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

This guide provides a [[stepbystep_guide_to_compressing_pdfs | step-by-step guide]] on how to [[video_compression | compress videos]] for easy sharing, specifically focusing on how to [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | compress videos for WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. WhatsApp has a capacity limit for videos, meaning not all videos can be sent without prior [[video_compression | compression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Requirements

To begin the [[video conversion process | video conversion process]] and [[video_compression | compression]], you will need an appropriate application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

*   **Video Compressor App**: Navigate to your device's app store and search for "Video Compressor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   While many [[video_compression_tools_available_in_app_stores | video compression tools available in app stores]] are useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>, the recommended option is "Video Compressor" as it typically features less advertising and fewer payment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Download and install this application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Step-by-Step Compression Process

Follow these steps to [[comparing video compression options | compress your videos]] using the recommended app:

1.  **Open the Application**: Launch the downloaded "Video Compressor" app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Select a Video**: Choose the option to "Compress a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Navigate to your video gallery and select the video you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   *Example*: A 3-minute video that is 34 megabytes is used for demonstration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
3.  **Adjust Compression Percentage**: The app will present "indices of compression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This refers to how much you want to compress the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   A higher percentage value indicates a smaller reduction from the original size, resulting in a larger compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Conversely, a lower percentage value means greater compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Reducing from 34.6 megabytes to 29.4 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
    *   The goal is to reduce the size while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining video quality limits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **Recommendation**: A 70% compression setting is suggested, which can result in a significant size reduction (e.g., 10 megabytes in the example) while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | preserving good quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
4.  **Set Playback Speed (Optional)**: You can also choose to set the playback speed of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
5.  **Choose Compression Mode**:
    *   **Normal Mode**: Automatically reduces the video's rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
    *   **Advanced Mode**: Allows for manual adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
6.  **Start Compression**: Tap "Compress" to begin the [[video_compression | compression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   The process typically takes around 20-30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
7.  **Save the Compressed Video**: Once compressed, you can save the video to your gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

The compressed video will now be available in your gallery, ready to be sent via WhatsApp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

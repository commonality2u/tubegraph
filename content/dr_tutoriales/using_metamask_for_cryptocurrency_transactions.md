Once added, USDT will be available within your [[managing_cryptocurrency_wallets | wallet]] for various uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Prerequisites
Before proceeding, ensure you are familiar with [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | using MetaMask]] or have already created an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. A detailed tutorial explaining the [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask platform]] and its features is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Adding USDT Token
The process for adding the USDT token is identical whether you are using your computer or your [[mobile_and_computerbased_cryptocurrency_transactions | cell phone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Step 1: Access Your MetaMask Wallet
Ensure you are logged into your [[managing_cryptocurrency_wallets | MetaMask wallet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

### Step 2: Find the USDT Contract Address
1.  Open a new web page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The link for this platform, which lists all cryptocurrencies and their existing contracts, will be provided in the first comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
2.  In the search engine of this platform, type "USDT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
3.  Once the USDT contract appears, you will see it accompanied by the [[finding_and_using_contract_addresses_on_metamask | MetaMask fox icon]], indicating compatibility with the MetaMask extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Step 3: Add the USDT Token to MetaMask
There are two primary methods to add the token:

#### Method 1: Manual Addition
1.  Go to the [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  Search for "USDT" within MetaMask; it might appear directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  If it doesn't appear, select the option to add a token by its [[finding_and_using_contract_addresses_on_metamask | contract address]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
4.  Copy the USDT contract address from the web page you opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
5.  Paste the contract address into the designated field in MetaMask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.
6.  The USDT token should then appear, and you can proceed to add it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. It will then be listed in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

#### Method 2: Automatic Addition via Fox Icon
1.  On the web page displaying the USDT contract, click the [[finding_and_using_contract_addresses_on_metamask | MetaMask fox icon]] next to the contract <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
2.  A MetaMask notification tab will open <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
3.  Once it loads, you can confirm adding the token directly to your [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask platform]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
4.  After refreshing the page, the USDT token will appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## Benefits of Adding USDT
Once the [[how_to_add_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token is listed]], you can use it to convert other cryptocurrencies and facilitate withdrawals if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This process of importing the [[how_to_add_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] into [[introduction_to_metamask_platform | MetaMask]] is very simple and straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

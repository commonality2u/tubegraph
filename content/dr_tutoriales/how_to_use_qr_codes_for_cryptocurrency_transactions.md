QR codes offer a streamlined method for conducting cryptocurrency transactions, primarily for receiving funds into a wallet by allowing quick scanning of wallet addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This method can be used when transferring cryptocurrencies between exchanges, such as from Coinbase to Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Receiving Cryptocurrencies via QR Code

To receive cryptocurrencies, such as Bitcoin, into a Binance account using a QR code:
1.  Navigate to the "Wallet" section and select "Overview" in your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
2.  Choose the "Deposit" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.
3.  Click on "Deposit Crypto Coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. This will open a tab where you can select the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. For instance, if transferring from Coinbase where funds are in Bitcoin, choose Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
4.  The system will generate a QR code and a corresponding wallet address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. This QR code represents the address of your Binance wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Important**: The QR code and address change based on the selected cryptocurrency, so ensure the correct currency is chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
5.  This QR code can then be scanned by an external wallet or exchange from which you are sending funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Sending Cryptocurrencies Using a QR Code (Mobile)

To send cryptocurrencies from a mobile device, such as using the Coinbase application:
1.  Access the Coinbase application on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
2.  Go to the wallet section for the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer, for example, Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>.
3.  Look for the QR code symbol, typically in the upper right corner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
4.  Grant the application access to your device's camera <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.
5.  Use the camera to scan the QR code displayed on the computer screen or another device, which contains the receiving wallet's address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
6.  Once the QR code is scanned, you can proceed to enter the amount of cryptocurrency you wish to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.

Alternatively, for sending from a computer, you would copy the wallet address directly instead of scanning a QR code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

After initiating the transfer, the transaction typically takes around 10 minutes to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>. You will receive a confirmation message on your mobile phone once the deposit is complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>, and the transaction will appear in your history within the receiving platform, such as Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

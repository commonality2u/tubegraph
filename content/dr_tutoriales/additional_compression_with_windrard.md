While direct [[pdf_compression_techniques | PDF compression]] offers significant size reduction, it's possible to achieve even greater compression by combining methods. After initially compressing a PDF, users can apply [[compressing_files_using_winrar | WinRAR]] to further reduce the file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## Combining Compression Methods

After performing an initial [[pdf_compression_techniques | PDF compression]], such as using a tool like I Love PDF, the resulting smaller PDF can then be subjected to further [[compressing_files_using_winrar | WinRAR]] compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This layered approach allows for potentially maximizing the file size reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

It is important to note that when choosing different [[file_compression_techniques_and_settings | compression settings]], such as "extreme compression" in [[compressing_files_using_winrar | WinRAR]], there is a trade-off: higher compression typically leads to lower quality of the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This factor involves sacrificing the quality of images, videos, and text within the PDF to achieve greater compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

From: [[dr_tutoriales]] <br/> 

While the primary method demonstrated for transcribing YouTube videos to text utilizes a [[google_chrome_extension_for_transcribing_youtube_videos | Google Chrome extension]] named Glass, the transcript indicates that integration with Python is also a possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Overview

The video mentions that the "Parent code" for the Glass extension can be installed and used from Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This suggests that the underlying technology or code base, which uses [[using_artificial_intelligence_for_video_to_text_conversion | Chat GPT]] for video to text conversion, can be leveraged programmatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Alternative Methods

Although Python integration is noted as an option, the video specifically focuses on demonstrating the process within [[using_google_chrome_for_online_transcription | Google Chrome]] using the Glass extension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. The user is instructed to install the extension on their Chrome browser to convert YouTube videos to text <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

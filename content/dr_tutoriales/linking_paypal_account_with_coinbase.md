This tutorial provides a comprehensive and updated guide on how to [[withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_paypal | withdraw money]] held in cryptocurrencies from Coinbase and Coinbase Pro platforms to a [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The process is designed to be as easy, simple, and intuitive as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Important Concepts and Prerequisites

Before proceeding, it's crucial to understand a few key concepts:

*   **Platform Compatibility**: Of the two platforms, Coinbase and Coinbase Pro, **only Coinbase** allows direct transfers to [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Transfer Steps**:
    *   If funds are in **Coinbase Pro**, they must first be transferred to Coinbase, then from Coinbase to [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] (two steps) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   If funds are already in **Coinbase**, only one step is needed: transfer directly to [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **Name Verification**: The name on your [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal account]] and Coinbase account must be identical to the name on your official identity document (e.g., DNI in Spain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Linking Your PayPal Account to Coinbase

The process of [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linking your PayPal account]] to Coinbase is straightforward:

1.  **Access Settings**: From the Coinbase platform, navigate to your profile (top right) and select "Configuration" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Payment Methods**: In the configuration section, go to "Financial Services" or "Payment Methods" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
3.  **Add PayPal**: Look for the option to "Add a payment method" and choose [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This step is for linking your account to enable fund withdrawals instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
4.  **Confirm Linkage**: Coinbase will prompt you to confirm access to part of your [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] profile information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Confirm to accept the linking. The email used for both Coinbase and [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] accounts should be the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   *Note*: You can [[how_to_deposit_funds_into_a_paypal_account | unlink your accounts]] at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

## Transferring Funds from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase

If your cryptocurrencies are on Coinbase Pro, you need to transfer them to Coinbase before withdrawing to [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

1.  **Access Coinbase Pro**: Log in to your Coinbase Pro account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
    *   **No Direct PayPal Link**: Coinbase Pro does not allow [[linking_a_credit_or_debit_card_to_paypal | linking PayPal]] directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Your linked bank accounts (like Santander Bank) will appear, but not [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
2.  **Convert to Desired Currency**: It is recommended to convert your cryptocurrencies (e.g., Cardano) into the target withdrawal currency (e.g., Euros) within Coinbase Pro before transferring to Coinbase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This is because commissions are generally higher for exchanges within Coinbase compared to Coinbase Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
3.  **Initiate Withdrawal**: Go to your portfolio on Coinbase Pro and select "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
4.  **Select Currency and Destination**: Choose the currency you wish to withdraw (e.g., EUR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Select the option to transfer to "Coinbase" (not a bank account) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   There is a daily transfer limit (e.g., 250,000 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Transfers from Coinbase Pro to Coinbase are typically free of commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> and instant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
5.  **Complete Transfer**: Enter the amount and confirm the withdrawal. The funds will now appear in your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Withdrawing Funds from Coinbase to PayPal

Once your funds are in your Coinbase account (either directly deposited or transferred from Coinbase Pro), you can withdraw them to your [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal account]]:

1.  **Access Coinbase Portfolio**: Go to the main Coinbase page and navigate to your "Portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, where your funds will be listed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
2.  **Select Funds and Withdraw**: Click on the specific currency (e.g., Euros) you wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, then select "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
3.  **Enter Amount**: Choose the amount you want to withdraw (e.g., "Remove everything" or a custom amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
4.  **Choose PayPal**: When prompted "Where do you want to remove it?", select the "instant retreat" option, which is free and linked to [[using_paypal_for_receiving_payments | PayPal]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, you can [[how_to_withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_a_bank_account | withdraw to your bank account]], which might incur a small commission (e.g., 0.15 euros in the European Commission) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Withdrawal**: Review the amount and withdrawal fee (which should be zero for [[withdraw_money_from_coinbase_to_paypal | PayPal]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Confirm the withdrawal.
6.  **Check PayPal**: A notification will be sent when the request is fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Update your [[using_paypal_for_transactions_on_binance | PayPal]] page to see the increased balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

The [[how_to_use_bnb_vault_on_binance | BNB Vault]] is a financial product offered by Binance that allows users to [[generating_cryptocurrencies_with_bnb_vault | obtain returns]] by investing the BNB currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is designed specifically for the BNB cryptocurrency, meaning other cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin or Ethereum cannot be invested directly in the BNB Vault <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This feature aggregates various earning opportunities for BNB holders into a single, convenient location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## Key Benefits

### Compounding Rewards
A primary benefit of investing in BNB Vault is the ability to [[generating_cryptocurrencies_with_bnb_vault | generate cryptocurrencies]] in multiple ways simultaneously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. When you invest your BNB in the Vault, you receive rewards from:
*   **Launchpool Projects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>: BNB Vault integrates with [[comparison_between_bnb_vault_and_launch_pool | Launchpool]], allowing you to earn new cryptocurrencies introduced through Launchpool projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, it might provide rewards from projects like "Everything" and "Litentry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Flexible Savings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>: In addition to Launchpool rewards, BNB Vault also provides rewards from [[flexible_savings_on_Binance | BNB flexible savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This means your BNB is also earning interest through the flexible savings product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
*   **Other Programs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>: BNB Vault may also offer random rewards and other cryptocurrencies through periodic programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

This combined approach yields greater benefits compared to only investing BNB in Launchpool, which would only provide the cryptocurrencies offered by the Launchpool system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

### Flexibility and Accessibility
BNB Vault operates as a [[flexible_savings_on_Binance | flexible savings]] product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This allows users to withdraw their invested BNB whenever they wish, without being subject to [[locked_savings_on_Binance | locked staking]] periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This flexibility is a significant advantage for managing cryptocurrency investments.

### Ease of Use
Accessing BNB Vault is straightforward within the Binance platform. Users can navigate to the "Finance" section from the main menu and select "BNB Vault" to manage their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. There is also an option for automatic transfer, which allows daily balances from spot accounts to be automatically invested into [[flexible_savings_on_Binance | flexible savings]] within the BNB Vault at 1 AM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

To successfully [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | link a bank account to PayPal]] and enable [[transferring_money_between_a_bank_and_paypal | money transfers]], a verification process is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This process ensures that PayPal recognizes the bank account as being associated with your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Without this verification, any transfer made to your PayPal balance from an unlinked bank account will be automatically rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Steps for Bank Account Verification

The linking and verification process typically takes one to two days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

1.  **PayPal Initiates a Small Transfer**: PayPal will send a small amount, such as a centime or a penny, to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Confirm the Amount**: You will need to confirm the exact amount of this transfer on the PayPal platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. For example, if PayPal sends a penny, you must confirm that the amount received was a penny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
3.  **Account Linked**: Once the amount is confirmed, your bank account will be officially [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]] to your PayPal account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Important Considerations

*   **Rejected Transfers**: If you attempt to make a transfer to your PayPal account without having first [[linking_a_bank_account_to_paypal | linked]] and verified your bank account, the transfer will be automatically rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This is a common issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
*   **Post-Linking Deposits**: After your bank account is linked and verified, you can proceed to deposit funds into your PayPal balance using the provided PayPal banking details, including the IBAN and beneficiary bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.
*   **Concept Field**: It is not necessary to put anything in the "concept" field during a transfer to PayPal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Beneficiary Name**: It is important to enter the correct name of the beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Transfer Time**: Bank transfers to PayPal can take one to two *working* days to be reflected in your balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. Non-working days (weekends, holidays) do not count within this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## What is USDT?

USDT (Tether) is a stablecoin designed to follow the behavior and value of the US dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It serves as a reliable representation of the dollar's value within the cryptocurrency world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Navigating Binance Markets

To buy USDT or other cryptocurrencies on Binance:

1.  **Access Markets:** Navigate to the "Markets" section on the Binance platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Filter by Zones:** Go to the "Zones" part and ensure "Everything" is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
3.  **Search for USDT:** Use the magnifying glass to search for "USDT" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Understanding Trading Pairs

When buying cryptocurrencies, it's crucial to understand the [[exploring_trading_markets_for_cryptocurrency_conversion | trading pair]] (e.g., `USDT/DAI` or `DAI/USDT`) as it determines which asset you are buying or selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:

*   If the cryptocurrency you want to acquire (e.g., USDT) appears **second** in the pair (e.g., `BITCOIN/USDT`), you need to **sell** the first asset (Bitcoin) to acquire USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   If the cryptocurrency you want to acquire (e.g., USDT) appears **first** in the pair (e.g., `USDT/DAI`), and you click "Buy," you would be buying the second asset (DAI) *with* USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Conversely, if you click "Sell," you would be selling USDT to acquire the second asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

This distinction is very important when operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

Western Union offers programs designed to reward users for their activity and for referring new customers to the platform. These programs aim to provide benefits such as reduced commissions and other advantages.

## My Western Union / My W Rewards

Western Union has a program called "My Western Union" or "My W" which rewards users with points when they execute transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:21">[07:01:21]</a>. These points can lead to benefits in commissions and other advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. To participate, users need a "My Western Union number," which is provided upon account verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

Western Union also features a [[referral_commissions_and_benefits | referral program]] that encourages users to [[creating_and_managing_referral_links | recommend the service to friends]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

If a new user opens an account using a specific [[creating_and_managing_referral_links | referral link]], they can receive an electronic gift code worth up to $20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Referral Condition

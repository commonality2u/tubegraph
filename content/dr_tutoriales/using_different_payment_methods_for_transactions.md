This guide explains how to deposit capital into the KuCoin platform and purchase cryptocurrencies using various [[choosing_payment_methods_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | payment methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It covers both fiat and cryptocurrency deposits, along with the process of buying crypto assets within the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Depositing Fiat Money

To deposit fiat money (e.g., EUR, USD, GBP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section in the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
2.  Select "Credit/Debit Card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Even when selecting credit/debit card, other [[choosing_payment_methods_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | payment methods]] such as Apple Pay and bank transfer (SEPA) will be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  Choose the currency you intend to deposit (e.g., USD, GBP, EUR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The available [[choosing_payment_methods_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | payment methods]] will change based on the selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. There is a minimum and maximum amount for deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   For example, depositing 120 euros and converting it to USDT (a stablecoin) is recommended to maintain a stable conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Understanding Commissions

Commissions vary depending on the [[choosing_payment_methods_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | payment method]] used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
*   For 120 euros, using Visa/Mastercard via the Pance intermediary method might result in receiving 135.24 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, indicating a commission of approximately 5 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   Using SEPA for the same amount could result in receiving 137-138 USDT, meaning about 2-3 dollars less in commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This highlights [[tips_on_avoiding_high_transaction_fees | the importance of comparing fees]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The commission is charged by the payment channel (e.g., Pance/Ivanssa), which acts as an intermediary between your fiat money and the crypto asset like USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. KuCoin itself does not hold fiat money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Processing Times
*   Card transfers are generally immediate, taking only a few minutes to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.
*   Bank transfers (like SEPA) may take business days, while card payments can be made on weekends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Depositing Cryptocurrencies

To transfer cryptocurrencies to KuCoin from another platform (e.g., Binance, Coinbase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>:

3.  Choose the "Main Account" for the deposit, as this is the primary account for general use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
4.  KuCoin will provide a deposit address for the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
5.  On your external platform (e.g., Binance), go to your wallet and select "Withdraw Crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
6.  Enter the KuCoin-provided deposit address into the withdrawal address field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The platform will automatically detect the network (e.g., Litecoin network) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   The minimum withdrawal amount and network commissions will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

1.  Navigate to the "Markets" section on the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### Trading Commissions
Trading commissions on KuCoin typically start at 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Commissions decrease as your volume of crypto coins (e.g., Bitcoin or KCS) held on the exchange increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

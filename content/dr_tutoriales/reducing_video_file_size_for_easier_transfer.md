Reducing the size of video files is essential for easier transfer via platforms like [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | WhatsApp]] or email, or simply to free up space on a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This tutorial focuses on how to compress video files [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | without losing quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Requirements

The primary requirement is to have the [[video_compression_using_vlc | VLC media player]] installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. VLC is capable of opening and playing video files, as well as editing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

The following steps detail how to compress a video file using VLC, ensuring [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | minimal quality loss]]:

### 1. Open the Video in VLC

*   Open the desired video file with VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. For example, a 1.93 GB HD chapter of the "Dark" series with multiple audio tracks can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### 2. Access the Convert/Save Feature

*   Once the video is open in VLC, navigate to "Media" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   Select "Convert/Save" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### 3. Add the Video File

*   In the pop-up screen, click "Add" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   Select the video track you wish to convert and compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
*   Click "Open" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### 4. Configure Conversion Settings

*   Click the "Convert/Save" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   It is crucial to set up the video to maintain quality while being compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Profile**: Select "H.264 + MP3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   Click the "Tools" (wrench) icon next to the profile to access [[vlc_settings_for_compressing_videos | advanced options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Encapsulation**: Must be "MP4/MOV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   **Video Codec**:
        *   Set Codec to "H.264" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
        *   Bitrate should be "Same as the source" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
        *   Resolution: Set "Scale" to "1" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Filters do not need to be adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Height and width should be automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
    *   **Audio Codec**: It is recommended to keep the "Original audio" to avoid losing the video's sound, though this can be adjusted to personal preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Click "Save" once configurations are complete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

### 5. [[exporting_and_saving_compressed_video_files | Export and Start Conversion]]

*   Choose the destination folder and name for the compressed file. For example, "compressed" on the desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   Click "Start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   VLC will begin the conversion process, indicated by the playback bar acting as a loading bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The conversion is complete when this bar reaches the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### 6. Verify Compression and Quality

*   After conversion, close VLC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   Check the properties of the new compressed file. For instance, a 1.93 GB file can be reduced to 384 MB, representing a reduction of over 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Open and play the compressed video to confirm that the audio works and the [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | quality is still good]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

This method allows for significant reduction in video file size without sacrificing quality or sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

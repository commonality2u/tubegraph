2.  **Find the USDT/USD Pair**: On the Kraken Pro exchange interface, search for "USDT" in the trading pairs. The USDT/USD pair should appear, typically with a 1:1 ratio, reflecting the dollar's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:32">[06:31:32]</a>.
3.  **Place a Sell Order**:
    *   Select the "Sell" option for USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:59">[06:50:59]</a>.
    *   Choose a "Market Order" for real-time execution, which is suitable given USDT's stable value against the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.
    *   Enter the amount of USDT you wish to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
    *   Review the total price and confirm by clicking "Review and Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Transferring USDT to Kraken

Before converting, you'll need to transfer your USDT to your Kraken account, for example, from an [[intermediary_exchanges_like_binance_and_kraken | exchange like Binance]].

1.  **Access Funds on Kraken**: Log into your Kraken account and navigate to the "Funds" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Show All Assets**: Click on "Show all assets" to display all available cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Search for USDT**: Locate USDT in the alphabetical list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
4.  **Select Deposit**: Choose the "Deposit" option for USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>.
5.  **Choose Blockchain Network**: Select the deposit method/blockchain. ERC-20 (Ethereum network) is commonly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
    *   *Minimum Deposit*: Note the minimum deposit amount, which is typically 1 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.
6.  **Acknowledge Risks**: Kraken will display a warning acknowledging that the user is responsible for coins sent to an incorrect address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>. Incorrect addresses can lead to permanent loss of funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.

    > ![[note]] **Important**: Always ensure the deposit address is correct. It's highly recommended to perform a small test transfer with a minimal amount first to confirm everything works correctly before sending larger sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.
7.  **Generate Address**: Generate a new deposit address. You can copy this address or scan a QR code if [[steps_to_transfer_ethereum_from_coinbase_to_kraken | transferring from a mobile device]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>.

### Withdrawing USDT from Binance (to Kraken)

If your USDT is on Binance, you would initiate the withdrawal process there:

1.  **Go to Wallet Spot**: In Binance, navigate to the "Wallet Spot" section, where your USDT is held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Withdrawal**: Select "Withdraw" for USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Enter Kraken Address**: Paste the USDT deposit address copied from Kraken into the withdrawal address field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.
4.  **Select Network**: Choose the same network you selected on Kraken, such as ERC-20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.
    *   *Network Fees*: Be aware of network fees (e.g., 10 USDT for ERC-20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. Review commission rules as fees can vary by network and quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
    *   *Optimal Transfer Amount*: Fees are often fixed regardless of the transfer amount. Therefore, transferring larger quantities is more cost-effective as the fee becomes a smaller percentage of the total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Withdrawal**: Enter the withdrawal amount and confirm the transaction.

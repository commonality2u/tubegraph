Binance offers various programs to help users earn profitability from their cryptocurrencies, including savings options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>. Among these are "locked savings," which allow users to deposit cryptocurrencies for a set period to earn higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Accessing Savings Options
To access savings options on Binance, navigate to the "Finance" section and then select the "savings" part, which compiles various programs for earning profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. This will lead to a page with three primary options: [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]], locked savings, and activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Clicking on "locked savings" will take you directly to that section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:07">[02:06:07]</a>.

## Flexible vs. Locked Savings
The main difference between [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] and locked savings lies in withdrawal flexibility and interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>:

*   **Flexible Savings**: Users can deposit and withdraw their cryptocurrency whenever they choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:55">[02:33:55]</a>. The interest rate received is generally more or less fixed, though it can vary and is not a constant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Returns are typically lower compared to locked savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:37">[03:37:37]</a>.
*   **Locked Savings**: Cryptocurrencies are deposited for a specific number of days, meaning they are "blocked" and cannot be withdrawn during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. The interest rate or profitability increases with the duration of the deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>.

## How Locked Savings Work
When using locked savings, you choose a cryptocurrency to deposit, such as USD or USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. You then select a duration for the deposit, which can be 7, 14, 30, or 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. The longer the duration, the higher the interest rate or profitability you will achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:09">[03:09:09]</a>. This is because providing the platform with a longer lock-up period allows them to generate more profitability through various activities like producing commissions or providing market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>.

The day you subscribe and deposit your cryptocurrencies, you will not receive interest; interest calculation begins from the second day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

### Example Deposit
The process for depositing into locked savings is similar to that for [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:05">[06:05:05]</a>. After selecting your cryptocurrency and desired duration, you would enter the amount and confirm the transfer. It's important to note that deposits cannot be made during specific UTC hours (23:50-00:10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.

## Considerations for Locked Savings
It is recommended to use locked savings when you do not immediately need the funds or are very confident in a long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Before depositing, carefully consider the current market situation and potential corrections for the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:08">[04:08:08]</a>. While not considered a high-risk product, there is a risk if the currency's value depreciates, as you will not be able to withdraw your capital until the lock period ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:27">[04:27:27]</a>.

## Checking Locked Funds
To check your deposited capital in locked savings, navigate to the "wallet" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:26">[06:26:26]</a>. Within the savings tab, you will find different sub-tabs, including "flexible," "locked," and "activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:35">[06:35:35]</a>. The "locked" tab will display your deposited amount, accumulated interest, and the option to redeem your funds once the lock period concludes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

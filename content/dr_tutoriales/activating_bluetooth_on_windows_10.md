Activating Bluetooth on a Windows 10 computer is a straightforward process [00:00:06]. This guide will walk you through the steps to enable and verify the Bluetooth functionality on your PC [00:00:09].

## Steps to Activate Bluetooth

### 1. Access Services

The first step is to open the Services window on your computer [00:00:45].
*   Go to the home bar (Start Menu) [00:00:47].
*   In the search bar, type "services" [00:00:54].
*   Open the "Services" application that appears [00:01:00].

### 2. Configure Bluetooth Compatibility Service

Within the Services window, you need to locate and configure the Bluetooth compatibility service [00:01:05].
*   Scroll through the list of services to find "Bluetooth compatibility service" [00:01:16]. It is listed in alphabetical order [00:01:34].
*   Once found, right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility service" and select "Properties" [00:01:40].
*   In the Properties window, set the "Startup type" to "Automatic" [00:01:47]. This ensures the service starts automatically with Windows. This step is also known as [[setting_bluetooth_service_to_automatic | setting Bluetooth service to automatic]].
*   Click "Apply" and then "OK" to save the changes [00:01:52].

### 3. Restart the Bluetooth Service

For the changes to take effect, the Bluetooth service needs to be restarted [00:02:04].
*   Right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility service" again [00:02:00].
*   Select "Restart" [00:02:04]. This action [[resetting_bluetooth_settings | resets the Bluetooth settings]] and implements the changes you just made [00:02:07].
*   Wait for the service to restart [00:02:16].
*   You can then close the Services window [00:02:24].

### 4. Adjust Bluetooth Settings in Windows 10

*   Search for "Bluetooth settings" or "Bluetooth and other devices" [00:02:33].
*   Open the "Bluetooth & other devices settings" window [00:02:37].
*   In this window, on the right side, click on "More Bluetooth options" [00:02:46].
*   Ensure that the checkbox for "Show Bluetooth icon in the notification area" is selected [00:02:53]. This will display the Bluetooth icon in your system tray, confirming that Bluetooth is enabled on your computer [00:03:12].
*   Click "OK" if you made any changes [00:03:01].

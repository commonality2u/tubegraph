## Sending Money on PayPal

To begin, ensure you have a [[paypal_account_setup_for_sending_money | PayPal account created]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Creating an account is straightforward and does not require linking a bank account or card during setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The process for sending money is similar whether using a computer or a mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Once logged into the PayPal platform, navigate to the "quick links" section or look for the "Send Money" option, typically found at the top or in quick links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Steps to Send Money:
1.  **Enter Recipient Details:** Input the PayPal contact's username or email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
2.  **Specify Amount:** Enter the desired amount to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
3.  **Add Purpose (Optional):** Include a note about what the payment is for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Distinguishing Between Friend and Business Payments

After entering the amount, you will be prompted to select the purpose of the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This step is crucial as it determines fees and buyer protection.

### Sending to a Friend
*   This option is generally selected for personal transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   [[sending_money_through_paypal_without_fees | Sending money]] to a friend is typically free when paying in euros within the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Sending for an Article or Service (Business Payment)
*   This option is used when making a purchase or sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   Typically, the seller pays a fee for these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Payments made under this category are covered by PayPal's [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | buyer protection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

#### Buyer Protection
PayPal's [[using_paypal_for_online_transactions | buyer protection]] is designed to secure purchases:
*   It encrypts data and provides protection against fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   Transactions are monitored 24 hours a day to prevent fraudulent activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   It is recommended to review the terms and conditions of buyer protection, especially when buying or selling items, to avoid any issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Payment Method and Confirmation
You can choose to pay using your PayPal balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. After confirming the details, the payment is sent.

### Transaction History
Once sent, the transaction will appear in your PayPal activity history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. You can view the status of the transaction (e.g., "unclaimed") and access a detailed resolution of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. You also have the option to print a receipt of the transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

Recipients can see the received money in their PayPal balance and view the transaction details in their activity log, with transfers typically completing within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

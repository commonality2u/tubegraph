File compression is a process that reduces the size of files, making them easier to transport, store, and send via email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This is particularly useful for overcoming email size limitations, such as Gmail's 25 MB limit for attachments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. By compressing files, a greater number of files can be sent in a single email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## WinRAR for File Compression

WinRAR is a widely used program that facilitates both file compression and decompression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Obtaining WinRAR
To acquire WinRAR, users can access their preferred search engine (e.g., Google Chrome) and search for "WinRAR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The first search result typically provides a download option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Installation is recommended due to its utility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

### [[setting_up_file_compression_with_winrar | Setting up File Compression with WinRAR]]
Once WinRAR is installed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, files can be compressed by following these steps:

1.  **Identify the file**: Select the file you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. As an example, a video file weighing 55.6 MB could not be transferred via Gmail without compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
2.  **Access compression options**: Right-click on the file and select the option to "Add to archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This option is represented by an icon resembling a book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
3.  **Configure compression settings**:
    *   **Archive name**: Choose a name for the compressed file (e.g., "test 1.rar") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. The ".rar" extension indicates it is a compressed file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
    *   **Compression method**: Set to "best size" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   **Dictionary size**: Set to the smallest possible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   **Divide into volumes**: Set to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
    *   **Compression options**: Select "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   **Password (optional)**: A password can be set for the compressed file if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
    *   **Advanced settings**: Generally, no changes are needed here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For certain source files, such as video files (e.g., .mkv), further compression options might not be available if they are already highly optimized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
4.  **Initiate compression**: Click "Accept" to begin the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
5.  **Review result**: After a few seconds, the compressed file will be generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In the example provided, a 55.6 MB video file was compressed to 43.9 MB, representing approximately a 20% reduction in size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Other Compression Methods

While WinRAR is effective, other methods for [[video_compression | video compression]] exist. For instance, VLC Media Player offers another method for [[video_compression | video compression]] that is highly efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

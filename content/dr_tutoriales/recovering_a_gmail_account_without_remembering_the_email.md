2.  **Navigate to Password Section**: Within settings, go to the "Autofill" section and then select "Passwords" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This area displays all saved passwords for various accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.
3.  **Search for Gmail Accounts**: In the "Search passwords" field, type "gmail" to filter and view all Gmail accounts and their associated passwords that have been saved in your browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

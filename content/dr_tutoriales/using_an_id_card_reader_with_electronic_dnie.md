This article details the process of using an ID card reader with your electronic National Identity Document (DNIe) to validate digital certificates on your computer.

## Prerequisites
To utilize your DNIe with a computer, you will need:
*   Your DNIe with an activated PIN key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
*   Specific software for configuring your computer and handling electronic signatures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.
*   A DNIe card reader device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## Obtaining the DNIe PIN
Your DNIe comes with a PIN key issued at the time the DNI is created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. If you do not have this code, or it is not activated, you can obtain it at the nearest police station using automatic machines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. You log in with your ID card to these machines to get the code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Software Installation
You will need to install specific software components to configure your computer for DNIe use. The necessary links are typically provided in the first comment of the tutorial video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. These include links from the government headquarters and for the electronic signature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Checking System Type (32-bit or 64-bit)
Before downloading, determine if your computer is 32-bit or 64-bit:
1.  Open File Explorer (records explorer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
2.  Go to "This PC" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
3.  Right-click on "This PC" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
4.  The system type (e.g., "64-bit operating system") will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Installing Necessary Software for DNIe
Download and install the correct versions for your system (e.g., Windows 64-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

1.  **DNIe Component (from government headquarters link):**
    *   Download the appropriate version (e.g., for Windows 64-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The download will begin automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
    *   This installation is generally followed by the self-signature component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
2.  **Electronic Signature (self-signature):**
    *   Download the latest version (e.g., 1.82 for 64-bit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   Run the installer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   Click "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, "Next", accept the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   You can set it up to allow Firefox to rely on the root certificate, but it's not mandatory if you use another browser like Google Chrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
    *   Click "Install" and then "Finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This installs the auto-signature on your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
3.  **FNMT Configurator:**
    *   Run the FNMT Configurator installer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Click "Yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
    *   Click "Next", accept the conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   Proceed with the installation in the default directory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
    *   Once installed, click "Next" and then "Finish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Connecting the DNIe Reader and ID Card
To validate your DNIe certificate, you need an ID card reader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. These readers are available for purchase online (e.g., on Amazon, links might be in the video's first comment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

1.  **Insert your ID card:** Fit your DNIe into the reader so that the chip on the card is properly aligned and read by the device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
2.  **Connect the reader:** Connect the reader to your computer via its USB port <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The computer should register the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>, indicating the device is reading your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

## Validating the Certificate
To confirm the DNIe reader and setup are working:
1.  Access the FNMT (FÃ¡brica Nacional de Moneda y Timbre) validation link (often found in the first comment of the tutorial video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
2.  Click on the option to validate a certificate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
3.  Select "Select Certificate" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
4.  The system will prompt you to open the installed self-signature application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
5.  Open the self-signature application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This application will read the electronic certificates embedded in your DNIe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
6.  You will see different certificates associated with your name, including authentication and signature certificates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Choose, for example, the signature of the electronic DNI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
7.  Enter your secret DNIe PIN code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
8.  If successful, the system will confirm "valid certificate" along with your name, surname, and ID card details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

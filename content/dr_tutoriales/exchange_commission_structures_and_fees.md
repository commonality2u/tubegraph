This article compares the commission structures and fees of the Coinbase (referred to as "cco in beige"), Coinbase Pro (referred to as "combis pro"), and Binance ("paint ans/balance") platforms to determine which is more beneficial for buying cryptocurrencies or investing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The comparison covers account fees, deposit fees, [[understanding_transaction_fees_in_cryptocurrency_exchanges | trading commissions]], staking opportunities, and withdrawal fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Account Fees

All three platforms — Coinbase, Coinbase Pro, and Binance — offer free accounts, meaning no fees are charged for simply having an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Deposit Fees

Deposit fees vary significantly across the platforms and depend on the method used:

*   **Coinbase**: Charges a commission ranging from 1% to 4% for deposits, with specific examples like 3.99% for users from Chile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: A SEPA transfer, for example, incurs a fee of 0.15 euros, showing a substantial difference from Coinbase's fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Binance**: Offers varied [[understanding_transaction_fees_in_cryptocurrency_exchanges | deposit commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>:
    *   Visa/MC charges 1.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
    *   SEPA transfers incur 0% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   Ideal charges 1.3 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   SWIFT transfers for USD incur zero commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
    *   Quick payments for GBP can also be zero commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

It is strongly recommended to use bank transfers (fiat deposits) rather than card payments to avoid high commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Using services like [[commissions_and_fees_on_wise | Wise]] or N26 for transfers to Binance can result in zero transfer fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Binance is considered the winner in this category due to its many zero-commission deposit options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

## Trading Fees

[[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | Trading commissions]] are crucial for active users:

*   **Binance**: Charges a base [[binance_commission_structure | commission]] of 0.1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This can be significantly reduced by holding Binance Coin (BNB) or by opting to pay commissions with BNB, which offers up to a 25% discount, lowering the rate to approximately 0.075% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Commissions can decrease further, down to 0.02%, based on trading volume and BNB holdings, across multiple levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Binance distinguishes between "maker" (limit orders) and "taker" (market orders) fees, although the base percentage applies to both, with reductions for volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   **Coinbase**: Has fixed [[understanding_transaction_fees_in_cryptocurrency_exchanges | commissions]] that depend on the amount of Bitcoin or money held on the platform, with a maximum of 3 euros and a minimum of 0.99 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: Offers a range from 0.50% down to 0.04% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Binance is deemed superior for [[understanding_transaction_fees_in_cryptocurrency_exchanges | trading commissions]], offering rates up to five times lower than Coinbase Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Users can also [[methods_to_reduce_binance_commissions | reduce Binance commissions]] by using a referral link when opening an account, saving up to 10% on commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## Investment and Staking Products

The availability and returns on staking/investment products are a key differentiator:

*   **Binance**: Offers a wide array of investment products, including flexible savings, locked staking, and high-risk options, each with multiple sub-products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Examples include annual returns of 4.90% to 21.60% for Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, and for CAKE, a 15-day locked staking option can yield 37.49% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Binance's robust offerings in this area are a significant advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Coinbase & Coinbase Pro**: Are considered much more limited in their investment product offerings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

Binance clearly wins in this category due to its diverse and high-yield investment options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

## Withdrawal Fees

Withdrawal fees are also important for accessing capital:

*   **Binance**:
    *   Euro withdrawals via bank transfer are 0.8 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.
    *   Card withdrawals incur a 1% fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
    *   GBP withdrawals cost 1.5 pounds for quick payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.
    *   USD withdrawals via SWIFT transfer can cost up to 30 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
*   **Coinbase**: Can charge up to 4% or a maximum of 10 euros per withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Coinbase Pro**: In some cases, such as wire transfers for GBP or SEPA transfers, charges less than Binance (e.g., 25p less for GBP wire transfer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. SWIFT transfers from Coinbase Pro are also less expensive than Binance's, at 25 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

Coinbase Pro shows advantages in certain fiat withdrawal methods, particularly for larger amounts via SWIFT transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. However, it is generally recommended to use exchange-provided cards (like the Binance card) for payments to avoid withdrawal fees entirely, as they offer benefits like cashback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Overall Conclusion

Considering all aspects, Binance is recommended as the best platform for operating with cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. This is due to its competitive [[understanding_transaction_fees_in_cryptocurrency_exchanges | commission fees]], diverse investment products with potential for high returns, and a wider selection of cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. Additionally, Binance's trading platform is described as more intuitive and interactive compared to Coinbase or Coinbase Pro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

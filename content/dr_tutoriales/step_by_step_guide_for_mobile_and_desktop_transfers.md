## Device Compatibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

This tutorial demonstrates the process using a mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, the exact steps and process are identical whether you are using Android, iOS, or a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Choosing an Exchange for Withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>

To withdraw cryptocurrency to a bank account, an exchange platform is necessary. Kraken is recommended over Coinbase for withdrawals, as Coinbase tends to charge higher fees for bank account withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

If you don't have a Kraken account, a referral link is provided in the first comment, offering a 20% discount on commissions for transactions, withdrawals, or capital deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Transferring Funds from Coinbase to Kraken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

The first step is to transfer your cryptocurrency from your current wallet (e.g., Coinbase) to the chosen exchange (Kraken).

### Step-by-Step Process:

1.  **Access Kraken**: Navigate to the Kraken platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
2.  **Go to Portfolio**: Once in Kraken, go to the "portfolio" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
3.  **Select Cryptocurrency**: Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to deposit, in this case, Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
4.  **Initiate Deposit**: Click on the "deposit" option. This is usually found by tapping the three dots (···) for more options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
5.  **Confirm Blockchain Network**: The deposit will be executed via the Ethereum blockchain, which is the network hosting the cryptocurrency in your Coinbase wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. The estimated deposit time is about 14 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
6.  **Copy Deposit Address**: Kraken will provide a unique deposit address for Ethereum. Copy this address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
7.  **Initiate Send from Coinbase**: In your Coinbase wallet, select the option to send your Ethereum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
8.  **Enter Amount**: Specify the full amount you wish to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
9.  **Paste Address**: Paste the Kraken deposit address into the recipient field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
10. **Confirm Transaction**: Review the transaction details, including the network suggested and the associated commissions (e.g., 7.55 to 6.52 USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Confirm the transaction to send your funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
11. **Monitor Transfer**: The transaction will be executed, and the funds will be sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. You will see the assets disappear from your Coinbase account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a> and then appear in your Kraken account after processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Scam Alert
> If you are asked for a large sum of money to withdraw your funds because you have been scammed, do not proceed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Contact the tutorial creator via social media or comments for assistance with such issues, as many cases of people being scammed during the withdrawal process have been encountered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Once the Ethereum is successfully transferred to your Kraken account, you can proceed with withdrawing it to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Stop market orders are a type of trading order available on platforms like [[KuCoin order types | KuCoin]] that follow a similar concept to [[stop_limit_orders | stop limit orders]] but execute at the prevailing [[market_orders_in_trading | market order]] price rather than a set limit price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## How it Works

Unlike a [[Limit orders explained | limit order]] where you set a specific purchase or sale price, a stop market order does not allow you to enter a price at which the order should execute <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. Instead, you define a "stop price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

When the price of the crypto asset reaches this pre-defined stop price, the order starts to execute at the current [[market_orders_in_trading | market order]] rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. The order will continue to be executed progressively, and 100% of the order will be filled once the price crosses the stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. If the price does not reach the stop price, only a percentage of the order might be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Key Features

*   **Risk Reduction:** This type of order helps reduce risk by ensuring that if the asset's price does not follow the desired pattern, the entire order is not necessarily executed, thereby preventing total loss of the money placed in the order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Flexibility:** Users have the flexibility to cancel a stop market order at any point, even if a percentage (e.g., 10%, 20%, up to 90%) has already been executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Example for Selling

If you want to place a sell stop market order, you would set a stop price (e.g., 10.354 for KCS/USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. The system will begin selling your specified quantity of KCS at the current [[market_orders_in_trading | market order]] price as the asset's value drops towards or below that stop price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. If the price continues to fall and does not reach the stop price, only a smaller percentage of the sell order might be executed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

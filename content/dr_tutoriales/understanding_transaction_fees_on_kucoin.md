The [[kucoin_platform_overview_and_interface | KuCoin platform]] charges various fees for different operations, including depositing fiat currency, converting it to crypto, and [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | trading cryptocurrencies]]. The amount of commission charged can depend on the method used, the payment channel, and the volume of cryptocurrency held or traded on the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

## Fiat Money Deposit Fees

When depositing fiat money (such as EUR, USD, or GBP) to convert it into a crypto asset like USDT, fees are incurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. These [[commission_fees_associated_with_cryptocurrency_conversion | commissions]] are typically charged by the payment channel, which acts as an intermediary between KuCoin and your fiat transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

For example, depositing 120 Euros:
*   Via Visa/Mastercard using a method like Pance, you might receive 135.24 USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, incurring approximately a 5 USD commission (compared to a direct conversion of 120 Euros to 140 USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   Using SEPA for the same 120 Euros, you might receive around 137-138 USDT, which is about 2-3 USD less in commission than the Visa/Mastercard example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

<p class="callout is-info">
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> It is recommended to investigate different payment methods as some may be cheaper depending on the currency (e.g., GBP, USD, CZK, RUB) and the associated payment channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Deposit Fees

When [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | transferring]] cryptocurrencies from another platform (like Binance or Coinbase) to KuCoin, the process generally involves selecting the cryptocurrency to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) and copying the provided KuCoin deposit address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. While the other platform may mention minimum withdrawal amounts and network commissions for the transfer, these are typically related to the sending platform's fees or the blockchain network, not a direct deposit fee from KuCoin itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Trading Fees

[[trading_fees_and_commission_structure_at_kucoin | Trading fees]] on KuCoin generally start at 0.1 percent for both maker and taker orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Fee Reduction Incentives
KuCoin incentivizes users to hold a larger volume of cryptocurrencies, particularly KCS (KuCoin Shares), to reduce their [[commission_fees_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | trading commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. The more Bitcoin or KCS you hold, the higher your trading level will be, resulting in lower maker and taker fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This encourages users to keep subscribed coins on the exchange for greater discounts when [[buying_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | trading]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Trading Accounts and Execution
When executing trades, ensure your funds are in the "Trading Account" within KuCoin. Funds deposited to the "Main Account" must be transferred to the "Trading Account" before you can place orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. KuCoin offers various [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | order types]], including market orders (buying at the current price), limit orders, and stop-limit orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Available Deposit Methods

### [[using_debit_or_credit_cards_on_wise | Debit Card or Credit Card]]
*   **Commission**: This method incurs an associated commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. For example, a 200 euro deposit might cost 0.82 euros in fees, totaling 200.82 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Speed**: Deposits made via [[using_debit_or_credit_cards_on_wise | Visa]] or [[using_debit_or_credit_cards_on_wise | Mastercard]] are typically processed within seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Process**: You will be prompted to enter your card details to complete the payment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### [[bank_transfers_and_paypal_transactions_on_wise | PayPal]]

### [[bank_transfers_and_paypal_transactions_on_wise | Bank Transfer]]

*   **Speed**: While free, [[bank_transfers_and_paypal_transactions_on_wise | bank transfers]] may take longer to process compared to card payments due to banking procedures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Other Methods
The platform may also display other local or electronic payment options such as "Behind Lee" (for electronic accounts) and "Ideal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Choosing a Deposit Method

The choice of deposit method often depends on the urgency of the transfer and the willingness to pay a commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For immediate access to funds, using a debit or credit card is recommended, despite the small fee. For cost-efficiency, a bank transfer is preferable as it is free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Once the payment is completed, the deposited amount will appear in your Wise balance, ready for use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

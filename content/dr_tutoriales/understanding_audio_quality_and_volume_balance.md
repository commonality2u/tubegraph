Achieving clear audio is crucial for recordings, streams, and online communication. While increasing microphone volume can enhance clarity for listeners, it's important to balance volume levels with maintaining audio quality. This article explores methods to [[increasing_microphone_volume_in_windows_10 | increase microphone volume]] on Windows 10 and discusses the impact on sound quality.

## [[adjusting_microphone_properties_and_levels | Adjusting Microphone Volume in Windows 10]]

The first method involves utilizing Windows 10's built-in sound settings to [[adjusting_microphone_properties_and_levels | increase your microphone's volume]]. This approach ensures that the volume is optimized without significant degradation of sound quality.

To access these settings:
1.  Navigate to the start taskbar and type "sound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
2.  Select "sound settings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
3.  Go to the "Input" section, not "Output," as Output pertains to speakers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
4.  Ensure the desired microphone is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.
5.  Click on "Properties of the device" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Within device properties, the microphone volume can be set to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. This represents the maximum volume your microphone can capture without reducing sound quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If the volume were to be increased beyond this point, the sound quality would decrease considerably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Keeping it at 100% or lower ensures it stays within the microphone's allowed quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Some Windows 10 computers may present a slightly different window for sound settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In this alternative window, users would navigate to the "levels" section where the microphone volume can also be set to 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## [[using_thirdparty_software_for_audio_enhancement | Utilizing External Software for Volume Control]]

For more granular control, or to capture audio at volumes beyond the default Windows maximum, external software can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. These programs allow users to record videos at a desired volume and "pass the audio at higher volumes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

A common method within such software (like OBS Studio, hinted at by "vsr" or "abs raw") involves:
1.  Going to the "microphones and auxiliaries" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
2.  Accessing "settings" and then "properties" to choose the microphone you wish to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
3.  Proceeding to the "Audio Mixer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
4.  Right-clicking and selecting "advanced audio properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Here, you will see different microphones or audio sources interacting in the recording <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The standard volume is typically 0.0 decibels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, which corresponds to 100% of the selected microphone's default output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

> [!warning] Volume vs. Quality
> Increasing the decibel level above 0.0 will progressively raise the volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. However, this technique increases volume at the cost of audio quality, making the sound "a little worse but higher" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This trade-off must be carefully considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

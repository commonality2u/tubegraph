When performing [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | cryptocurrency exchanges]] on Binance, understanding the associated [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] and [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | fees]] is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Reducing Commissions

You can get a [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | 10% discount]] on [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] by using a referral link when creating an account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This discount applies to [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | deposits]], [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | transactions]], [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | operations]], and [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | capital withdrawals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The money saved through this [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | 10% discount]] can be used to buy other cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Commissions for Cryptocurrency Conversions

Binance states that it does not charge [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] for OTC (Over-The-Counter) operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Method 1: Convert Function

When using the "Convert" method on Binance, there is no direct [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commission]] associated with the cryptocurrency conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. However, there will be a "spread" where the prices are bought at various market rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Method 2: Market Orders

When performing conversions using market orders, which involve buying at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, this is considered a real-time market order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. While not explicitly stated as a separate commission, the pricing will reflect the market spread as mentioned for OTC operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

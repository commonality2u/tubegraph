## Depositing Fiat Money

1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section in the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
2.  Select "Credit/Debit Card" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Other payment methods like Apple Pay or bank transfers may also be available here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired currency (e.g., USD, GBP, EUR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The available payment methods will change based on the selected currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to deposit. Note that there are minimum and maximum amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
5.  Select the cryptocurrency you want to convert your fiat into. It is recommended to convert to a stablecoin like USDT (US Dollar Tether) for price stability, rather than volatile assets like Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
6.  Review the commissions charged by the chosen payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. These commissions are paid to the payment channel (e.g., Pance/Iv√°n Sa), which acts as an intermediary between your fiat money and the crypto asset on [[understanding_kucoins_platform_and_interface | KuCoin]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.
    *   For example, depositing 120 Euros via Visa Mastercard using the Pance method might result in receiving 135.24 USDT, implying a commission of approximately 5 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Using SEPA might result in lower commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
7.  Proceed with the payment by filling in your card details on the redirected page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Card transfers are typically immediate, taking only a few minutes to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

It is important to understand that when depositing fiat money on [[understanding_kucoins_platform_and_interface | KuCoin]], it is immediately converted into a crypto asset (like USDT); you will not find the original fiat currency stored as such within your [[understanding_kucoins_platform and interface | KuCoin]] account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

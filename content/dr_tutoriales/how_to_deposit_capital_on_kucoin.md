This tutorial provides a guide on [[buying_selling_and_transferring_cryptocurrencies_on_kucoin | how to deposit capital and buy cryptocurrencies]] within the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. It covers depositing both fiat money and cryptocurrencies, as well as the process of purchasing crypto assets on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Depositing Fiat Money on KuCoin

To deposit fiat money (such as euros, dollars, or pound sterling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>:
1.  Navigate to the "Buy Crypto" section in the top menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.
2.  Select "Credit Card/Debit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. Other payment methods like Apple Pay or bank transfers may also be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
3.  Choose your desired currency (e.g., USD, EUR, GBP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. Available payment methods will vary depending on the chosen currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount you wish to deposit. Note that minimum and maximum amounts apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.
5.  It is recommended to convert fiat to a stablecoin like USDT (US Dollar Tether) to maintain a stable conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
6.  The platform will display the commission charged based on the chosen payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. For example, depositing 120 euros might result in receiving 135.24 USDT via Visa/Mastercard using Banxa as a payment channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. This commission covers the intermediary service between fiat money and the crypto asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
7.  Complete the transfer by filling in your payment details on the raft page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>.
8.  Card transfers are typically processed within a few minutes, while bank transfers may take business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
9.  KuCoin itself does not hold fiat currency directly; deposited fiat is converted into crypto assets like USDT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Depositing Cryptocurrencies on KuCoin

To transfer cryptocurrencies to KuCoin from another platform (e.g., Binance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>:
1.  Go to the "Assets" section and click "Deposit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
2.  Select the specific cryptocurrency you wish to deposit (e.g., Bitcoin, Litecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
3.  KuCoin will provide a unique deposit address for that cryptocurrency on your main account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
4.  On your external platform (e.g., Binance), navigate to your wallet and select "Withdraw Crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
5.  Choose the same cryptocurrency and paste the KuCoin deposit address into the withdrawal field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>. The external platform should automatically detect the correct network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>.
6.  Review minimum withdrawal amounts and network commissions on the withdrawal platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.

## Buying Cryptocurrencies on KuCoin

Once capital (fiat converted to stablecoin or deposited cryptocurrencies) is on the platform, you can buy other crypto assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
1.  Go to the "Markets" section on the KuCoin platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
2.  Select the base currency (e.g., USDT) to find all interchangeable pairs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. KuCoin offers a wide variety of cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
3.  **Commissions**: Trading commissions generally start at 0.1% but decrease with higher trading volume or holding KuCoin Shares (KCS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This encourages users to hold more assets on the exchange for discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
4.  Select the desired cryptocurrency pair (e.g., KCS/USDT) to open the interactive trading menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
5.  Enter your security verification code, which is set up during account creation, to enable trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.
6.  The trading interface includes a price chart, order book, and recent operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
7.  Ensure "Spot" trading is selected for direct purchases (not margin trading with leverage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
8.  Choose your order type:
    *   **Market Order**: Buys at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. You do not specify the price, only the quantity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
    *   Other [[types_of_orders_on_kucoin | order types]] like Limit, Stop Limit, and Stop orders allow you to set a specific price for buying or selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
9.  **Crucial Step: Transferring Funds to the Trading Account**: Before you can buy, your funds must be in the "Trading Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.
    *   Your "Main Account" is for deposits and withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
    *   To transfer, go to "Assets" -> "Main Account" (or "Trade Account") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.
    *   Click "Transfer" and select "From Main Account to Trading Account" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. Enter the amount to transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.
10. Once funds are in the Trading Account, you can proceed with placing your purchase order (e.g., using 100% of your USDT to buy KCS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>. The order will be placed successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>. Your newly purchased crypto will appear in your trading account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:45:00">[12:45:00]</a>.

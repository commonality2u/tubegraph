The Advcash platform is an electronic or digital wallet designed for managing capital online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. It is similar to platforms like PayPal but distinguishes itself by allowing users to trade various cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Advcash also integrates national fiat currencies within the same ecosystem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, supporting a wide range of currencies such as US dollars, euros, rubles, and Kazakhstan coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Currency Exchange

Advcash allows for the exchange of various currencies, including fiat currencies and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### Fiat Currency Exchange
Users can exchange one fiat currency for another, such as converting euros to US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. When performing a currency swap, Advcash does not explicitly display the commissions charged, so users are advised to verify the real exchange rate independently (e.g., via Google) to identify any hidden fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.

### Supported Fiat Currencies
Advcash contains a large number of national currencies, helping users pay in different countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Examples include US dollars, euros, and rubles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency Operations

Advcash supports a variety of cryptocurrency operations, including buying, selling, sending, receiving, and earning interest.

### Buying and Selling Cryptocurrencies
Advcash allows users to buy and sell crypto assets directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Partnerships:** The platform partners with [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] ("balance platform") for its buy and sell crypto features <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:35">[02:33:35]</a>. This partnership is intended to offer favorable rates and low commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:59">[02:39:59]</a>. Users can buy various cryptocurrencies through this integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Payment Methods:** Cryptocurrencies can be purchased using funds from the Advcash account, or via Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>. It is recommended to buy through the [[how_to_exchange_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Binance]] integration as direct card purchases can incur higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:47">[02:48:47]</a>.
*   **Selling:** Users can sell their cryptocurrencies, and the resulting fiat capital (e.g., dollars or euros) is stored within their Advcash account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:57">[02:50:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:50">[02:51:50]</a>.

### Sending and Receiving Cryptocurrencies
Advcash facilitates sending and receiving cryptocurrencies.
*   **Deposit Commissions:** There are generally no commissions applied by Advcash for depositing cryptocurrencies onto the platform, as fees are typically charged by the exchange from which the funds are being withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:30">[01:16:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:07">[01:27:07]</a>.
*   **Blockchain Support:** Advcash supports various blockchains, including TRC20 and ERC20, with TRC20 noted for being relatively cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   **Transaction Details:** For deposits, a QR code and a wallet address are provided, which remain valid for 15 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:08">[01:12:08]</a>. Users must be careful to copy the correct address to avoid losing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.
*   **Confirmation:** A deposit requires six confirmations from the blockchain to be completed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:29">[01:32:29]</a>.

*   **Interest Earnings:** By holding cryptocurrencies on the platform through this collaboration, users can earn up to 8% annualized interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

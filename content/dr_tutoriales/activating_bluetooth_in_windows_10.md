## Enabling the Bluetooth Compatibility Service

The first step to activating Bluetooth involves configuring its service in Windows:
1.  Go to the Windows 10 Home bar and search for "Services" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
2.  Within the Services window, locate "Bluetooth compatibility service" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This service is typically found under the 'S' section due to alphabetical order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
3.  Right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility service" and select "Properties" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
4.  In the Properties window, set the "Startup type" to "Automatic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
5.  Click "Apply" and then "Accept" to save the changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
6.  Right-click on "Bluetooth compatibility service" again and select "Restart" to apply the implemented changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Configuring Bluetooth Settings

After enabling the service, you need to adjust the general Bluetooth settings:
1.  Close the Services window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
2.  Go back to the taskbar and search for "Bluetooth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
3.  Open "Bluetooth settings and other devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.
4.  Once the "Bluetooth & other devices" window is open, navigate to "More Bluetooth options" on the right side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
5.  Ensure that the option to "Show the Bluetooth icon in the notification area" is selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. If it's not selected, simply check the box and click "OK" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
    *   This step ensures that the Bluetooth symbol is visible, indicating that Bluetooth is enabled on the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

## Demonstrating Bluetooth Connectivity

To verify that Bluetooth is working correctly, you can try connecting a device, such as a mobile phone:
1.  Return to the "Bluetooth & other devices" settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
2.  Click on "Add Bluetooth or other devices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
3.  Search for the device you wish to add (e.g., an iPhone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
4.  Select your device from the list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
5.  On your mobile device, accept the connection request from the computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
Once linked, the device will be ready to communicate and transmit data between the computer and the mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

This guide provides a tutorial on managing cryptocurrency transactions, specifically transferring Bitcoin from a Coinbase account to a Binance account, utilizing both computer and mobile interfaces.

## Why Transfer Cryptocurrencies to Binance?

Binance is presented as a more effective broker for cryptocurrencies compared to Coinbase, primarily because it offers more avenues for reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Transferring cryptocurrencies from Coinbase to Binance is recommended to gain profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

If you are working with Coinbase and do not yet have a Binance account, creating one with a provided code can offer a 10% discount on [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Transferring Bitcoin from Coinbase to Binance

### Obtaining Your Binance Deposit Address (Computer)

To [[receiving_cryptocurrency_through_external_wallets | receive cryptocurrency]] on Binance, you need to obtain its deposit address:
1.  Navigate to "Wallet" then "Overview" on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
2.  Select the "Deposit" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
3.  Click "Deposit Crypto Coins" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   *Note:* Do not select "Deposit Fiat," which refers to local currencies like euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.
4.  Choose the cryptocurrency you intend to deposit; in this case, Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
5.  A unique QR code and a corresponding code (address) will be generated. This code is specific to the chosen cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Pay close attention to both the [[how_to_use_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | QR code]] and the address below it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This address represents your Binance wallet for receiving Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Sending from Coinbase (Mobile)

You can initiate the transfer using the Coinbase mobile application:
1.  Access the Coinbase application on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the cryptocurrency you wish to transfer, such as Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
3.  Go to the Bitcoin wallet section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
4.  Locate the [[how_to_use_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | QR code]] symbol, typically in the upper right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
5.  Grant camera access to scan the [[how_to_use_qr_codes_for_cryptocurrency_transactions | QR code]] displayed on your computer screen from Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
6.  Input the amount of Bitcoin you want to send <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
7.  Proceed with the transfer.

### Sending from Coinbase (Computer)

Alternatively, you can perform the transfer directly from your computer:
1.  On the Binance deposit screen, copy the generated address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
2.  On Coinbase, click "Send and Receive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.
3.  Choose the amount of Bitcoin you wish to [[transferring_cryptocurrency_between_platforms | transfer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
4.  Paste the copied Binance address into the recipient field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
5.  Add a note for the transaction, if desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
6.  Review the transaction details, including the [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | commission]] fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
7.  Confirm the transfer. You will need to enter a verification code received on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Transaction Confirmation and Monitoring

After initiating the transfer, your balance on Coinbase will disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The transaction is estimated to take approximately 10 minutes to process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

Once the transfer is complete, you will receive a confirmation message on your mobile phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. You can also verify the deposit by checking the transaction history within [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_binance | your Binance account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The transferred funds will be reflected in your Binance fiat and spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

It is advisable to keep the transaction confirmation email from Coinbase to Binance as collateral in case any issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

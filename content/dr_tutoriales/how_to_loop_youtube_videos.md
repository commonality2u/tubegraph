This tutorial explains how to set YouTube videos to loop, allowing them to restart automatically once they finish playing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This feature is useful for continuous listening to music or watching videos without manual intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Prerequisites

*   The process is demonstrated using [[using_google_chrome_for_youtube | Google Chrome]], a reliable browser that works well for this purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Activating Loop Mode on a YouTube Video

To activate loop mode for a YouTube video:
1.  Access any YouTube video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. For instance, a video titled "[[creating_youtube_playlists | how to create playlists in 2021]]" can be used as an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
2.  While the video is playing, **right-click** anywhere on the video frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
3.  A dropdown menu will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
4.  Click on the "Loop" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Once "Loop" is selected, the video will automatically restart from the beginning when it reaches its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This means the video will play continuously without requiring any user input <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

> [!INFO] Loop Confirmation
> After activating, if the video ends, it will start again automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Deactivating Loop Mode on a YouTube Video

To deactivate loop mode:
1.  While the video is playing, **right-click** on the video screen again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
2.  The same dropdown menu will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
3.  Click on the "Loop" option again to unselect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Once deactivated, when the video reaches its end, it will no longer restart but will instead pause playback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

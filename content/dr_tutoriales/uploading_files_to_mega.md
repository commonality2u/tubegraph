Mega is a web service used for downloading and uploading content, enabling users to share files and download them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is commonly used for sharing series, movies, and documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## [[how_to_create_a_mega_account | Creating a Mega Account]]

To create a Mega account, you simply need to enter an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After providing your email, you will receive a confirmation email that you need to use to confirm your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## [[understanding_mega_storage_plans | Understanding Mega Storage Plans]]

Upon creating an account, Mega will present different usage plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The free plan provides up to 50 gigabytes of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. While this is relatively small, it is sufficient for storing small or relatively small files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. There are also paid options available, such as Lite and Pro accounts, if more storage is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This guide focuses on working with the default free account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | Compressing Files for Optimized Storage]]

To optimize storage on your Mega account, especially with the 50 GB free limit, it is recommended to compress files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This can be done using WinRAR, a program designed for file compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

For example, a folder containing a series like "La Casa de Papel" might originally weigh 2.21 gigabytes per episode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. If there are eight episodes, this quickly consumes nearly 20 gigabytes, almost half of the free storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Compressing such a folder can significantly reduce its size, for instance, from 20 GB to 13.1 GB, saving around 8-9 gigabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

To compress a file or folder with WinRAR:
1.  Right-click on the file or folder you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  Click "add file" (recognizable by the WinRAR books logo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  In the WinRAR dialogue box, ensure the file format is "rar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
4.  Set the compression method to "better" for maximum compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
5.  Select the option to "create a solid file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
6.  Click "accept" to start the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

Once compressed, you can open the WinRAR file to verify that your original files are inside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## [[sharing_and_managing_mega_download_links | Sharing and Managing Mega Download Links]]

Once your file has been uploaded to the Mega cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>:

4.  To share the file, simply provide this link to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
5.  To provide the separate encryption key, click on "cipher key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Copy the key displayed there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Users will need to enter this key to download the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

MEGA is a web page used to upload and download content, enabling one person to upload files for another to download <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. It is commonly used to [[using_mega_for_file_sharing | share files]] like series, movies, or documents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## [[creating_a_mega_account | Creating a MEGA Account]]

To [[creating_a_mega_account | create a MEGA account]], you simply need to enter an email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After entering your email, you will receive a confirmation email that you need to confirm to finalize the account creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

Upon [[creating_a_mega_account | account creation]], MEGA presents various plans, including a free option and paid tiers (Lite, Pro, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The free plan provides up to 50 gigabytes of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. While this is considered relatively little, it is sufficient for storing small or relatively small files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This tutorial focuses on working with the default free account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Optimizing Storage with [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | WinRAR]]

To optimize the 50 gigabytes of storage offered by the free MEGA account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>, it is recommended to [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compress files]] using [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | WinRAR]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | WinRAR]] is a program designed to compress files <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Steps to Compress Files with [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | WinRAR]]:
1.  Right-click on the file or folder you wish to compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
2.  Click on "Add to archive..." (represented by the WinRAR books logo) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
3.  In the compression options, ensure the archive format is "RAR" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
4.  Set the compression method to "Best" for maximum compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
5.  Check the option to "Create solid archive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.
6.  Click "OK" to start the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

For example, a folder weighing 2.21 gigabytes (e.g., a series like "La Casa de Papel") can be compressed to significantly reduce its size, saving substantial storage space on your MEGA account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. A 2.21 GB folder, when multiplied by 8 (assuming 8 files), could take up almost 20 GB of storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, once compressed, the same content could reduce to 13.1 gigabytes, effectively compressing around 8-9 gigabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. After compression, you can open the `.rar` file to verify its contents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

## Uploading Files to MEGA

Once your files are ready (especially after [[compressing_files_with_winrar_for_mega | compressing]] them for efficiency), you can upload them to your MEGA account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Steps to Upload:
1.  Navigate to the cloud symbol within your MEGA interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
2.  From the upload options, you can choose to upload "New folder," "files," or "upload folders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
3.  Select "upload file" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
4.  Browse and select the file you wish to upload (e.g., your compressed `.rar` file) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
5.  The upload process will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

## [[managing_and_sharing_mega_links | Managing and Sharing MEGA Links]]

After a file has been successfully uploaded to the MEGA cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>, you can [[managing_and_sharing_mega_links | share]] it with others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Steps to Share Files:
1.  Right-click on the uploaded file in your MEGA account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
2.  Select the "Manage link" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
3.  The link displayed includes an encryption key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
4.  To obtain the separate encryption key, click on "Cipher key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
5.  Copy this key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
6.  To [[managing_and_sharing_mega_links | share]] the content, provide both the link and the separate encryption key. Users with both will be able to access and download the content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

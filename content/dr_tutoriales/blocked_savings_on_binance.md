Blocked savings on [[Binance]] are a feature that allows users to earn [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_Binance_savings | profitability]] on their [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_Binance | cryptocurrencies]] by depositing them for a fixed period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This option offers a higher interest rate compared to [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Accessing Blocked Savings
To access blocked savings on [[Binance]], navigate to the "Finance" section on the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Within "Finance," select "Savings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. You will find options for both [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] and blocked savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Clicking on "Flexible Savings" will lead you to a page where you can also select the "Blocked Savings" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## How Blocked Savings Work
With blocked savings, users deposit a specific [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_Binance | cryptocurrency]] for a predetermined number of days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This means the deposited assets are "blocked" and cannot be withdrawn until the chosen period ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Key characteristics include:
*   **Fixed Duration** Users choose the duration of the deposit, which can be options like 7, 14, 30, or 90 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Variable Interest Rates** The [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_Binance_savings | interest rate]] (profitability) varies depending on the chosen duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. A longer duration generally yields a higher interest rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is because providing the platform with more time and confidence in the asset allows them to generate more [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_Binance_savings | profitability]] through commissions or market liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **No Early Withdrawal** Unlike [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]], assets deposited into blocked savings cannot be removed before the specified period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

## Comparison with Flexible Savings
The primary distinction between blocked and [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] is the withdrawal flexibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **[[flexible_savings_on_binance | Flexible savings]]** allows users to deposit and [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | withdraw]] their [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_Binance | cryptocurrency]] at any time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. However, the returns are lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
*   **Blocked savings** requires the [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_Binance | cryptocurrency]] to be deposited for a fixed term, preventing early withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This restriction is compensated with higher [[interest_rates_and_profitability_with_Binance_savings | profitability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

## Considerations for Use
It is recommended to use blocked savings when the deposited capital is not immediately needed, or when there is strong confidence in a long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For example, if there is no intention of selling a [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_Binance | cryptocurrency]] like Bitcoin in the long term, blocked savings could be considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Users should:
*   **Analyze Market Conditions** Carefully consider the market period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. If the market is entering a correction phase for the [[managing_and_storing_cryptocurrency_on_Binance | cryptocurrency]] to be deposited, it's crucial to think carefully about the chosen duration (e.g., 7, 30, or 90 days) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.
*   **Understand Risks** While not a high-risk product, it's important to be aware that if the currency depreciates, the capital cannot be withdrawn during the blocked period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Depositing into Blocked Savings
The process for depositing into blocked savings is similar to that for [[flexible_savings_on_binance | flexible savings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Minimum Amount** There will be a minimum amount required to enter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Subscription Hours** Subscriptions for flexible products, and likely for blocked products, are closed during specific UTC hours (23:50:00 to 00:10:00) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Interest Calculation** Interest begins to be calculated from the second day after subscription; no interest is received on the day of subscription and deposit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

After confirming the transfer, the subscription is successful, and the capital starts producing income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

## Managing Blocked Savings
To check on your deposited capital, go to the "Wallet" section of [[Binance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Within the wallet, navigate to the "Savings" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Here, you will find different tabs, including "Flexible," "Locked," and "Activities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. If you have deposited into locked savings, you would find it under the "Locked" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The interface shows the total amount deposited, subscription date, and accumulated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. While the option to "redeem" might appear, for blocked savings, this action is only available once the fixed term has concluded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

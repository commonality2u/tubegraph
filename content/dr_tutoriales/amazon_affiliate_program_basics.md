The Amazon Affiliate Program allows users to earn a commission by promoting Amazon products and generating sales through unique affiliate links <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This means that when people use your provided link to make a purchase, you receive a small amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Obtaining Amazon Affiliate Links

There are two primary methods to obtain Amazon affiliate links:

### 1. Using the "Product Links" Tab

To get started, access your registered [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | Amazon Affiliates]] account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. If you do not have an account, a video tutorial on [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | how to create an account]] is available and described as super easy and simple, taking only five minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

Once logged in:
1.  Navigate to the "Product Links" tab on the Amazon Affiliates screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>.
2.  Select the "Product Links" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.
3.  Utilize the search engine to find any desired product within Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. For example, searching for "Call of Duty PlayStation 4" will display all relevant products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.
4.  After finding a product, clicking the arrow next to it provides a long link that can be copied and pasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
5.  This long URL can be shortened by clicking the arrow again and selecting the option to "shorten the URL" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. The shorter link can then be copied and pasted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### 2. Using the Amazon Web Bar

This method is considered very simple and useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.
1.  Go to the official Amazon main page <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
2.  At the top of the page, locate the "Amazon Web Bar Affiliates" taskbar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. This utility is exclusively available to accounts registered with [[creating_an_amazon_affiliates_account | Amazon Affiliates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
3.  Search for any product on the main Amazon site <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.
4.  Once on a product page, the Amazon Web Bar will offer options to get the link in "text format" or "text plus image" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

#### Link Options

*   **Text Format**: Provides a link where you can choose a short or full URL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. It also allows selection of the affiliate ID for tracking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.
*   **Text Plus Image**: Generates a different link that, when clicked, will open the product in a new tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This feature is useful as it prevents users from losing your website's tracking or losing your page when clicking the link <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

After obtaining the link, it can be copied and placed on your website or other pages where you are promoting Amazon products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

## Related Information

*   **Plugins**: A [[wordpress_plugins_for_amazon_affiliates | WordPress plugin]] can be used to advertise Amazon products without needing the [[using_asin_codes_for_amazon_affiliate_products | ASIN code]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The ASIN code is typically required for promoting products after making three sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

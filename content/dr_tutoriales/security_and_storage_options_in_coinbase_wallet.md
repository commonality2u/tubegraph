Coinbase Wallet is presented as a secure application designed for saving cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. It allows users to store various cryptocurrencies, tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>, and even NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

## Key Security Features

Coinbase Wallet offers several features to protect users' assets:
*   **Secure Storage** Your assets are protected with secure authentication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
*   **Biometric and Password Protection** Users can protect their wallet using Face ID (on iPhones) or by setting a password on other mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.
*   **Recovery Phrase** A critical security measure is the recovery phrase. Users are explicitly warned that losing this phrase will prevent them from accessing their account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This phrase, typically 12 words, is essential for restoring access to the wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.

### Backing Up Your Wallet

The wallet offers options to [[backing_up_and_securing_your_wallet | back up]] your recovery phrase:
*   **iCloud Backup** Users can choose to back up their recovery phrase to iCloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   **Manual Backup** Alternatively, users can manually copy their recovery phrase (a series of 12 words) to a secure location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Storage and Asset Management

The wallet allows users to store a wide range of cryptocurrencies and tokens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>. It also supports storing NFTs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

Users can view their stored coins and NFTs through a dedicated section in the wallet's menu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. The platform emphasizes secure storage for all assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

### Blockchain Selection
Coinbase Wallet allows users to choose the blockchain they are using, such as Ethereum (ETH) or Polygon (MATIC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. This flexibility enables users to manage assets across different networks, adapting to their specific needs within the crypto space.

### Privacy Settings
During the setup process, users can choose their privacy level for their Coinbase Wallet username:
*   **Public** This option allows other Coinbase Wallet users to search for your username and send you cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. This is generally recommended for ease of receiving funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Private** This option prevents other wallets from being able to search for your profile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Coinbase Wallet as an Independent Platform

It's important to note that Coinbase Wallet is an independent wallet application separate from the main Coinbase exchange platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. While it can connect to your main Coinbase account for easier transfers, any transactions involving Coinbase Wallet (e.g., transfers from Coinbase or other platforms) will incur commissions associated with the specific blockchain network being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

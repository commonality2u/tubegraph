Binance utilizes a VIP level system that significantly impacts the [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] users pay on the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Understanding and advancing through these levels can lead to substantial savings, making it one of the most important aspects of [[reducing_binance_commissions | reducing commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## How VIP Levels are Determined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

A user's VIP level on Binance is determined by two main factors:
*   **Trading Volume** This refers to the volume of [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | transactions]] made on the spot or futures market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. For example, to reach VIP 1, a user might need to trade 49.918 Bitcoin on the spot market or 249 Bitcoin on the futures market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **BNB Balance** The amount of BNB (Binance Coin) held in your wallet or flexible savings also contributes to your VIP level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. It's important to note that BNB held in locked savings or other blocked products does not count towards the available balance for VIP level calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The more volume you trade and the more BNB you hold, the higher your VIP level will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Higher VIP levels, such as VIP 1, VIP 2, and so forth, are associated with lower commission rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Impact on Commission Rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>

The core benefit of advancing VIP levels is a reduction in [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. As your VIP level increases, the percentage of commission charged on [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | operations]] decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

For instance, a VIP 0 user typically pays 0.1% in commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This rate decreases for higher VIP levels; a VIP 1 user would pay 0.09% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. The maximum level is VIP 9, which requires holding over 150,000 Bitcoins or 11,000 BNB to achieve the lowest possible rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Using BNB for Additional Discounts

Beyond the VIP level itself, paying [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] with BNB (Binance Coin) provides an immediate 25% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This option, when activated, ensures that whenever you buy or sell cryptocurrencies on the platform, the [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commission]] will be collected in BNB at a reduced rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

By enabling this feature and having a small quantity of BNB in your spot wallet (not locked savings), your commission rate drops from 0.1% to 0.075% on applicable [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | transactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

> [!important]
> To benefit from the BNB discount, you must have the option activated and hold BNB in your available wallet balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Without BNB in your wallet, even if the option is activated, you will still be charged the standard 0.1% commission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Referral Links and Other Savings

New users can also benefit from [[referral_commissions_and_benefits | referral links]], which may offer a 10% discount on [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] when making deposits, [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | transactions]], or other capital [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | operations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

> For Fiat deposits and withdrawals, using a digital bank like Bank N26 can help avoid bank commissions associated with international transfers (e.g., from Europe to the UK after Brexit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This bank allows zero-commission [[managing_cryptocurrency_transactions_and_commissions | transactions]] to countries outside the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

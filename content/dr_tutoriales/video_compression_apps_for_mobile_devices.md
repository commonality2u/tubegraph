Compressing videos is essential for sharing them via platforms like WhatsApp, which impose a capacity limit on file size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This guide outlines how to use a video compression app on mobile devices to [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reduce video file size]] while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Finding a Video Compressor App

To begin, you will need to download a video compressor application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>:

1.  Navigate to your device's App Store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
2.  Search for "video compressor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
3.  While multiple options may appear, it is recommended to choose an app that has less advertising and fewer payment requirements, as these are often the most useful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | How to Compress a Video]]

Once the video compressor application is downloaded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, follow these steps to [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | compress your video]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>:

### 1. Select a Video

*   Open the video compressor application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   Choose the option to "compress a video" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   Select the video you wish to compress from your device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. For example, a three-minute video might initially be around 34 megabytes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### 2. Choose Compression Percentage

*   The app will display options for compression percentages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   The percentage indicates how much the original size of the video will be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. A higher percentage means greater compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   For instance, compressing a 34.6 MB video at 85% could reduce it to 29.4 MB <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
*   While the app may offer normal (automatic) and advanced (manual) modes for rate reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, the goal is to [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reduce the size]] enough to pass WhatsApp's limit while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining acceptable quality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. A 70% compression rate, resulting in about a 10 MB reduction, is often effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### 3. Compress and Save

*   Once you've selected your desired compression, initiate the compression process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   Compression typically takes between 20 to 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   After compression is complete, the app allows you to save the new, compressed video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The compressed video will be saved to your device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

This tutorial explains how to [[keyboard_blocking_and_unlocking_in_windows_versions | block and unlock your computer's keyboard]], particularly if it has been locked by accident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This method is applicable to Windows 7, 8, and 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## How the Keyboard Becomes Locked

The keyboard can become locked by accidentally activating a feature called [[using_windows_filter_keys_to_lock_the_keyboard | Windows filter keys]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This typically happens when the Shift key is held down for more than eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. When activated, a prompt appears asking if you want to turn on the [[using_windows_filter_keys_to_lock_the_keyboard | Filter Keys]] for Windows 10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The "Yes" option often appears by default, and users may press it unintentionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. After confirming, the keyboard will cease to function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Unlocking the Keyboard

To unlock your keyboard, follow these steps:
1.  Locate the Shift key, which is typically found underneath the Enter key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.
2.  Press and hold the Shift key for approximately eight seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
3.  After the eight seconds, you should hear a sound, and your keyboard functionality will be restored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This action essentially [[disabling_filter_keys_to_restore_keyboard_functionality | deactivates the filter keys]], allowing you to type freely again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Adding the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] to Metamask

A primary feature of [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] is the ability to list specific tokens, such as the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]], to make them available for use and conversion within the wallet [00:00:04].

The process to add the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] involves the following steps:

1.  **Accessing a Cryptocurrency Contract Listing Platform**: Open a web page that lists cryptocurrencies with their existing contracts [00:01:15]. The link for such a platform is typically provided in the first comment of a tutorial [00:01:12].
2.  **Searching for [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT]]**: Within the search engine of the contract listing platform, type "USDT" [00:01:22].
3.  **Opening the Contract**: Once "USDT" appears, open its entry to reveal its contract details [00:01:26].

Once the contract details are visible, the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] can be added to [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] using two main methods:

### Method 1: Manual Addition within [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]]

*   Go to the [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] platform [00:01:37].
*   Look for an option to add tokens. If "USDT" appears in a search or suggested list, it can be added directly [00:01:39].
*   If it doesn't appear directly, use the "contract address token" option [00:01:49].
*   Copy the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT]] contract address from the contract listing platform [00:01:57].
*   Paste the address into the designated field in [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] [00:01:57]. The [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] should then appear [00:02:03].
*   Confirm the addition, and the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] will be listed in the wallet [00:02:03].

### Method 2: Direct Addition via Metamask Extension

*   On the contract listing web page, there may be a "little fox" icon (representing the [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] extension) next to the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT]] contract [00:01:29].
*   Clicking this icon will open a [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] notification tab [00:02:12].
*   Once loaded, this notification allows users to add the token directly to their [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] platform [00:02:15].
*   After the token is added, refreshing the [[using_metamask_to_manage_cryptocurrencies | Metamask]] page will display the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] [00:02:24].

Once the [[adding_usdt_token_to_metamask | USDT token]] is listed, it can be used for converting other cryptocurrencies or for withdrawals [00:02:28].

A referral link is available in the first comment of the video for a 10% discount on commissions for those who do not have an [[creating_and_verifying_a_binance_account | account within futures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This discount applies to [[using_binance_exchange_for_transactions | deposits, transactions, operations, or withdrawals of capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Getting Started

To begin, open the Binance application on your [[using_binance_mobile_app_for_trading | mobile device]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Accessing Futures

Within the bottom menu of the app, locate and select the "Futures" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. It is assumed that you already have an [[creating_and_verifying_a_binance_account | open futures account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### Futures Sections

Upon entering the futures option, you will see different choices: USDM, CoinM, and Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This tutorial primarily focuses on the USDM section, which is the main area for futures operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

*   **USDM:** This section allows you to filter and choose various assets for trading, such as IOTA USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Bitcoin is a popular choice due to its volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **CoinM:** Here, you can find other assets compared to the dollar, like Bitcoin USD (permanent or quarterly) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Funding Your Futures Account

Before operating, you must [[transferring_money_to_the_futures_account | transfer money from your account to the futures account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

1.  Navigate to your "Wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  Go to the "Futures" part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Select "Transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
4.  Choose to transfer capital from your Spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
5.  Funds must be transferred in USD, as it is the asset used for trading with cryptocurrencies (e.g., Bitcoin USD, Ethereum USD, IOTA USD) within futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
6.  Select the desired amount to transfer and confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The transferred amount will be reflected in your USD balance in the futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

## Margin Modes and Leverage

Within the futures section, you will need to adjust the margin mode and leverage.

### Margin Modes

Click on the "crossed" option to choose between "Crossed" or "Isolated" margin modes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

*   **Crossed Mode:** All orders in cross mode share the same asset balance. In case of liquidation, all your assets within that mode, along with any open positions, can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This means if losses exceed your futures balance, funds from other wallets could be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Isolated Mode:** The margin assigned to a position is restricted to a certain amount. If this quantity is exceeded, only that specific position is liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This prevents the risk of losing more money than what is in your futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

It is generally recommended to work in **Isolated mode** to mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Confirm the change to Isolated mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### Leverage

Next to the margin mode, you can select your [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]], ranging up to 75x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. The maximum position size changes with the chosen leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. A notice in red will appear if the leverage is considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Financing Rate

Clicking the financing counter on the right provides information on the average pay between traders for the next financing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If positive, buyers pay sellers; if negative, sellers pay buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

## Placing and Managing Orders

The application allows you to buy or sell and choose between different order types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

### Market Order

The simplest order is a **Market order** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. When selected, clicking "buy" or "sell" will execute the transaction immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

1.  Choose the amount (e.g., XRP amount or USD amount) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
2.  Note the cost displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
3.  Confirm the purchase. Note that there might be a minimum quantity for certain assets (e.g., 5 XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### Limit Order

You can also place limit orders by setting specific buy or sell values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

1.  Go to the candlestick chart to identify desired entry or exit points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
2.  Input the specific value you want to buy or sell at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
3.  Enter the desired amount of the asset (e.g., 20 dollars worth of XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
4.  Confirm the order. Open orders will appear for execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### Managing Open Positions

Once an order is executed and a position is open, you can monitor it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

*   **PNL (Profit and Loss):** The "NLP" indicates the balance of the operation, showing if you are in positive or negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Adjust Leverage:** You can modify the [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]] even on an open position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Close Position:** To close an operation, you can place a sell order for the entire amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Order History:** You can view your order history (open, completed orders) on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

## Important Considerations

It is crucial to be clear about prices and values when operating, especially with volatile assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Working from a computer is generally recommended for complex operations, while [[using_binance_mobile_app_for_trading | mobile phone]] trading should be reserved for when operations are very clear, due to the need to be highly attentive to market fluctuations and the risks associated with [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

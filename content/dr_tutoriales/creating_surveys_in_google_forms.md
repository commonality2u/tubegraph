Google Forms is a versatile tool for creating surveys and collecting responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This guide will walk you through the process of setting up a survey from scratch.

## Accessing Google Forms

To access Google Forms, open your web browser, such as [[accessing_google_forms_through_google_chrome | Google Chrome]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. You can find the Forms application (represented by a purple icon) by clicking on the nine-dot grid (Google Apps launcher) on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This will take you directly to the Google Forms interface <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Starting a New Survey

While Google Forms offers various templates for specific purposes like event attendance confirmation or contact details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, surveys often require a blank form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

To begin:
1.  Click on "Blank" to [[how_to_create_a_google_form | create a new blank form]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
2.  **Add a Title:** Give your survey a relevant title, such as "Survey Number One" or "Survey on Belfast" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
3.  **Add a Description:** Provide a description for your survey, for example, "Survey for the final degree project of the psychology course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. You can customize the description with bold or italics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Previewing Your Form

To see how your survey will appear to respondents, click the "Preview" icon (eye icon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Adding Questions to Your Survey

When creating questions for a survey, certain question types are more appropriate than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Recommended Question Types for Surveys

The most commonly used question types for surveys are:
*   **Multiple Options (Multiple Choice):** Allows respondents to select one choice from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes:** Enables respondents to select multiple options from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Drop-downs:** Presents options in a drop-down menu for single selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Linear Scale:** Useful for rating things, such as satisfaction on a scale (e.g., 1 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. You can label the start and end points of the scale (e.g., "very little" to "much") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Less Common Question Types for Surveys

*   **Short Answer:** Generally not used for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Paragraph:** Generally not used for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Other Available Question Types

Google Forms also offers advanced question types that can be useful depending on your survey's complexity:
*   Multiple option grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>
*   Checkbox grids <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>
*   Date and time questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, allowing you to ask when the form is being filled out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Limiting Response Time

You can limit the time respondents have to answer the survey using a free plugin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. For more information, refer to the tutorial linked in the video's cards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Survey Configuration Settings

The "Settings" tab (represented by a gear icon) provides various [[google_forms_configuration_settings | configuration options]] for your survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Responses Section

Under "Responses," you can configure how responses are collected and managed:
*   **Collect Email Addresses:** You can choose to collect the email addresses of respondents. This can be useful for verifying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   **Send Respondents Copies of Their Replies:** Allows respondents to receive a copy of their submitted answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Allow Response Editing:** You can prevent respondents from modifying their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Limit to 1 response:** Essential for ensuring each person fills out the survey only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. If this option is unchecked, people can fill in the survey multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Presentation Section

The "Presentation" section provides options related to how the survey is presented, and how results are displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### Default Settings

You can save form defaults to apply certain settings to future forms you create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Viewing Responses

After your survey has been filled out, you can [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | view the responses]] simply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

## Overview
This guide provides a step-by-step tutorial on how to remove a password from an Excel workbook, particularly useful if the password has been forgotten or needs to be removed for accessibility [00:00:00]. It also briefly touches upon other Excel protection features.

## Accessing Protection Options
To begin, open the password-protected Excel file [00:00:17]. Upon opening, the workbook will prompt for a password [00:00:31]. Once inside the file:
1.  Navigate to the "File" tab [00:00:43].
2.  Click on "Info" from the options on the left [00:00:48].
3.  Locate the "Protect Workbook" section [00:00:55].

## Workbook Protection Features
The "Protect Workbook" feature in Excel offers various options for securing your data:
*   **Encrypt with Password:** This option allows you to set a password for the entire workbook [00:00:59].
*   **Protect Current Sheet:** Individual sheets can be protected, which is useful for [[managing_confidential_data_in_excel | confidential]] or private data that should not be viewed or edited by others [00:01:04].
*   **Protect Workbook Structure:** You can also protect specific boards or the overall structure of the workbook [00:01:08].
The editing and protection features are described as "very complete" [00:01:10].

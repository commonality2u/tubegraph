This article outlines how to customize survey questions and manage response options within Google Forms. For general information on [[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | creating surveys]], see the related article.

## Accessing Google Forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>
To access Google Forms, navigate to the forms section, which is typically represented by purple icons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Creating a New Survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>
When [[creating_surveys_in_google_forms | creating surveys]], you can start with a blank form <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Setting the Title and Description
Assign a title to your survey (e.g., "Survey Number One") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. You can also add a description, such as "Survey for the final degree project of the psychology course" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The description text can be formatted using bold or italics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Previewing the Survey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>
To see how your survey appears to respondents, use the "preview" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This allows you to check the layout and flow before publishing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Customizing Survey Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>
Google Forms offers various question types to suit different survey needs:

*   **Multiple Options (Multiple Choice)**: Allows respondents to select one option from a predefined list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Checkboxes**: Enables respondents to select multiple options from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
*   **Dropdowns**: Presents options in a dropdown menu, from which respondents select one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Linear Scale**: Used for rating questions, allowing respondents to choose a value within a defined range (e.g., 1 to 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Labels can be added for the minimum (e.g., "very little") and maximum (e.g., "much") values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Grids (Multiple Options Grid, Checkbox Grid)**: Useful for presenting multiple questions with the same set of answer choices in a grid format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Date and Time**: Allows respondents to input specific dates and times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Question Types Generally Not Applied in Surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>
Typically, short answer or long paragraph answers are not used for surveys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Adding Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>
You can add more questions to your survey as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

### Limiting Response Time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
You can set a time limit for respondents to answer the survey by using a plugin, which is free and simple to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Configuring Survey Response Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>
Within the [[google_forms_configuration_settings | Google Forms configuration settings]], specifically under the "Responses" tab, you can manage how responses are collected and handled:

*   **Collect Email Addresses**: You can choose to collect the email addresses of respondents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This can be useful for verifying results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Send Copies of Replies**: You can configure the form to send respondents a copy of their submitted answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This requires collecting email addresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   **Allow Response Modifications**: You can allow or prevent respondents from modifying their answers after submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. For surveys, it's often preferred that answers cannot be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Limit to One Response**: This setting ensures that each person can fill out the survey only once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Viewing Responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
Once the survey is created, responses can be viewed easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. While the article notes that responses are saved automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>, the presenter indicates [[viewing_responses_in_google_forms | how to view responses in Google Forms]] will be covered in future tutorials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

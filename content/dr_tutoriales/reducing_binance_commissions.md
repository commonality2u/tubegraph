Saving on commissions on Binance can significantly increase funds available for other cryptocurrency investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. This article outlines five main types of transactions that incur commissions on Binance and strategies to [[understanding_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | reduce]] them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.

## [[types_of_transactions_with_commissions_on_binance | Commissions]] on Deposits

Binance charges [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] on [[alternatives_for_depositing_money_into_binance_with_low_commissions | deposits]] of both Fiat currency and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.

### Fiat Currency Deposits
When [[alternatives_for_depositing_money_into_binance_with_low_commissions | depositing money]] in national currencies like EUR or USD, various methods are available, such as bank transfers, card payments, or digital wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.
*   **Bank Transfer:** This method is generally recommended for its lower [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:04">[02:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Using Bank N26:** Due to Brexit, bank transfers from within Europe to Binance (based in the UK) may incur bank [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Opening an account with Bank N26, a digital bank, allows for transactions to non-EU countries (like the UK or US) with zero [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. This can save all [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] on Fiat deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Referral Link:** Using a [[binance_referral_program | referral link]] when creating a new account can provide a 10% [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | discount]] on commissions for deposits, transactions, or operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Deposits
Binance does not charge any [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]] for receiving cryptocurrencies from other wallets or accounts (e.g., Coinbase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Any [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] incurred are typically from the platform or wallet used to send the cryptocurrency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>.

## Internal Transfers

Transfers between different wallets within the same Binance account (e.g., from a spot wallet to a futures wallet for leveraged trading) are free of [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:06">[05:05:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Binance explicitly states that internal transfers are free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>.

## Trading Operations (Buying/Selling)

Commissions on buying and selling cryptocurrencies are determined by your VIP level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>, which is influenced by your trading volume and the amount of [[BNB | BNB]] (Binance Coin) held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.
*   **VIP Levels:** Higher VIP levels (e.g., VIP one, VIP two) result in lower [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>. For example, VIP zero pays 0.1% [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]], while VIP one pays 0.09% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Using [[BNB | BNB]] for Fee Payments:** Activating the option to pay [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commissions]] with [[BNB | BNB]] provides a 25% [[getting_discounts_on_binance_transaction_fees | discount]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
    *   To benefit from this, ensure you hold a sufficient amount of [[BNB | BNB]] in your available spot wallet (not locked savings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of paying 0.1% [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]], you would pay 0.075% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.
    *   The [[BNB | BNB]] token is designed to simplify financial transactions on Binance and reduce [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

## [[using_binance_card_for_cashback_and_commission_savings | Binance Card]] Cashback

Using the [[using_binance_card_for_cashback_and_commission_savings | Binance Visa card]] for payments offers cashback rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   The cashback percentage depends on the amount of [[BNB | BNB]] you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. For example, holding 10 [[BNB | BNB]] provides a 2% refund on payments made with the card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
*   This cashback effectively reduces the cost of transactions made using the card.

## Commissions on Withdrawals

Binance charges [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] on withdrawals of both Fiat currency and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

### Fiat Currency Withdrawals
*   **Bank Transfer:** For Fiat withdrawals via bank transfer, a [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commission]] of 0.8% on Euros is charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.
*   **Using Bank N26:** Similar to deposits, using Bank N26 for withdrawals is recommended to avoid additional bank [[dealing_with_commissions_and_fees_on_binance | commissions]] that may be charged by traditional banks when receiving transfers from Binance (based in the UK) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Fiat withdrawals via bank transfer typically take one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

### Cryptocurrency Withdrawals
When transferring cryptocurrencies to another account or cold wallet, [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commissions]] are charged based on the network used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a>. These [[understanding_transaction_fees_and_tax_implications_on_binance | commissions]] cannot currently be reduced beyond the [[binance_referral_program | referral link]] discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. For instance, a Bitcoin withdrawal might cost 30 cents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>, while using the [[BNB | BNB]] chain might cost 0.07 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>.

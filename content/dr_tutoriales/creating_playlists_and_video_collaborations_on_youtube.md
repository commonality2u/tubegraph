Upon creating a new YouTube channel, certain core functionalities are enabled by default, including the ability to create playlists and add video collaborations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>. These features do not require additional verification, unlike options such as uploading videos longer than 15 minutes or initiating live broadcasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:14">[01:00:14]</a>.

## Accessing Functionality in YouTube Studio

To manage channel features, including those related to playlists and collaborations, users can access [[youtube_studio_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]] directly from their YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Configuration Steps

1.  Navigate to the "Configuration" section within [[youtube_studio_for_channel_management | YouTube Studio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
2.  Select the "Channel" sub-tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.
3.  Go to the "Access to functions" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:05">[01:00:05]</a>.

Under "Default functions," a new account will show that "upload videos," "create playlists," and "add video collaborations" are already enabled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>, indicating these are ready for use without any additional setup or verification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>.

A dedicated playlist is also available to help users learn how to grow their channel on YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

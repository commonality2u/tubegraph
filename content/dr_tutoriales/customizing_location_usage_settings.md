This guide outlines the steps to manage location services and privacy settings on your iPhone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Accessing Location Settings

To begin, navigate to the device's settings:
*   Open the "Settings" application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. If you cannot find it, search for "Adjustments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   Once in "Adjustments" (Settings), scroll down to locate "Privacy & Security" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This section is identified by a blue hand symbol <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Managing Location Services

Within "Privacy & Security," you will find sections for "localization" (location) and "tracking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Global Location Services Control
*   You can activate or deactivate Location Services entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   If you choose to deactivate it from this main setting, it will be deactivated for all applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. For more information on this, see [[how_to_deactivate_location_services_on_ios|How to deactivate location services on iOS]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   There is also an option to cancel Location Sharing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   The "Find My iPhone" feature is typically activated for recovery in case of loss or theft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### [[managing_location_settings_for_individual_apps_on_iphone|Customizing Location Usage for Individual Applications]]
It is possible to manage location permissions for different applications independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For applications like Air Canada, Volt, or La Compass, you can select specific usage options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>:
*   **"Used when we're abusing it"**: Likely refers to "While Using the App" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **"Don't ask each time it is used"**: Likely refers to "Ask Next Time Or When I Share" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **"Never to be used"**: Disables location access for the app <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **"Always use"**: Allows the app to access location even when not actively in use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

These options allow you to manage your mobile phone's location based on individual applications or their specific use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For some applications, like Uber or Bolt, location services are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

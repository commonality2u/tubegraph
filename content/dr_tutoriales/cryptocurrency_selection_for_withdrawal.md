Withdrawing capital from a cryptocurrency platform to a bank account can be done in a few simple steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The process is similar for both iPhone and Android mobile devices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Initial Steps for Withdrawal

1.  **Open the Application**: Begin by opening your cryptocurrency application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
2.  **Determine Cryptocurrency**: It is crucial to decide which cryptocurrency you intend to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The choice often depends on the platform you are withdrawing to. For example, BNB is accepted on the [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
3.  **Choose a Conventional Exchange**: If you wish to transfer funds from one platform (e.g., Trust Wallet) to another (e.g., KuCoin) before withdrawing to a bank, you simply send the chosen cryptocurrency (like BNB, Ethereum, or Bitcoin) to a conventional exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Compatible Exchanges

## Withdrawal Process Example (using BNB to Binance)

The following outlines a specific example of withdrawing BNB from Trust Wallet to the [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]] platform, and then to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>:

1.  **Send Cryptocurrency from Wallet**: From your initial wallet (e.g., Trust Wallet), select "send" and specify the amount of cryptocurrency (e.g., $56 worth of BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.
2.  **Deposit on Exchange**:
    *   Open your chosen exchange application (e.g., [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
    *   Go to "deposit" and select the cryptocurrency you are receiving (e.g., BNB) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
    *   Choose the correct blockchain (e.g., BNB Chain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Copy the wallet address and paste it into the "send" field on your initial wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
    *   Confirm the transaction, noting any commissions (e.g., two cents for the transaction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Your capital will then be removed from the initial platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
3.  **Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat**:
    *   Once your capital arrives in the exchange's spot wallet (e.g., [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | Binance]]'s spot wallet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>, navigate to the "trade" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
    *   Select "convert" and change your cryptocurrency (e.g., BNB) to a stablecoin like USDT or directly to fiat currency like Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Ensure the conversion to Euro is successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

When [[creating_youtube_posts_on_mobile | creating YouTube posts on mobile]], it is possible to include additional elements like photos and surveys to enhance your publication [01:39].

## Functionality

*   **Adding Photos**: Users can add photos to their YouTube posts directly from their mobile device [01:41].
*   **Adding Surveys**: The option to add surveys is also available when publishing from a mobile phone [01:41]. This option is typically found at the bottom of the screen [01:43].

While these features are available, a very simple post may opt not to include them [01:44].

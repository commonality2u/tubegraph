It aims to simplify the process and help users achieve profitability with their coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Getting Started

### Referral Program & Discounts
A [[using_binance_referral_program_on_mobile | referral link]] is provided, offering a 10% discount on commissions for those who do not yet have a futures account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This discount applies to deposits, transactions, operations, or capital withdrawals, helping users save on [[buying_cryptocurrency_on_pc_and_mobile | cryptocurrencies]] and purchase others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

### Prerequisites
It is assumed that the user already has an [[operating_within_binance_futures_account | open futures account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A tutorial on opening a futures account is available for those who need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Navigating the Binance App Interface
To begin, open the [[using_the_binance_app_on_a_mobile_phone | Binance app]] on your mobile device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
In the bottom menu, locate and select the "Futures" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

### Futures Options
Within the futures option, several choices appear:
*   **USDM**: This is the main section for [[using_binance_mobile_app_for_trading | trading]] and where most operations are conducted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It allows filtering by favorite assets or searching through a wide range of assets like IOTA USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Assets here are typically exchanged with USD (e.g., Bitcoin USD, Ethereum USD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **CoM**: This section contains other assets compared to the dollar, such as Bitcoin US permanently or quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
*   **Options**: Other options are available but not covered in this tutorial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

## Funding Your Futures Account
Before [[using_binance_mobile_app_for_trading | operating]], you must [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | transfer]] money from your spot account to your futures account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
1.  Go to "Wallet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
2.  Navigate to the "Futures" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
3.  Select "Transfer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. It's important to avoid "loan" or "repayment" options due to associated interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
4.  [[how_to_transfer_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | Transfer]] your capital from the Spot wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
5.  Funds must be transferred in USD, as this is the primary asset for futures operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

## Setting Up Your Trade

### Margin Mode: Cross vs. Isolated
It is crucial to modify the margin mode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.
*   **Cross Mode**: All orders under the same cross mode share the same asset balance. In case of liquidation, your entire asset balance in the futures wallet and any open positions can be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. If you lose more than you have in futures, money will be taken from other wallets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   **Isolated Mode**: The margin assigned to a position is restricted to a certain amount. If this quantity is exceeded, only that specific position is liquidated. This prevents the risk of losing more money than you have in your futures wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
    *   **Recommendation**: Always work in **Isolated** mode for safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Leverage
After selecting Isolated mode, you can choose your [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]], ranging from one to seventy-five times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. The leverage affects the maximum size of your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. A red warning will appear if the [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]] is considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

### Funding Counter
On the right side of the screen, there is a funding counter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This displays the average payment between traders for the next financing period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>:
*   If positive, buyers pay sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   If negative, sellers pay buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Placing an Order
The tutorial focuses on placing a **Market Order** for simplicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. A market order executes immediately at the current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

1.  Select the desired asset (e.g., Bitcoin or XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
2.  Choose "Buy" or "Sell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
3.  Select "Market" as the order type <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
4.  Enter the amount of XRP or the value in USD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The system will display the cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
    *   *Note*: There might be a minimum purchase quantity (e.g., minimum 5 XRP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
5.  Click "Buy" to execute the order immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Managing Open Positions
Once an order is executed, it becomes an open position.
*   **PNL (Profit and Loss)**: This shows the balance of your operation, indicating whether you are in positive or negative territory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Leverage**: You can modify the [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]] on an open position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Closing an Operation**: To close a position, you can place a sell order for the amount of XRP you hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   Alternatively, the "Close All" option can be used in the "Positions" tab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## Order History
You can view your order history to see executed and completed orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This shows purchases and sales that have occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

## Recommendations for Mobile Trading
While possible, [[using_binance_mobile_app_for_trading | trading]] on a mobile phone requires extreme vigilance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>:
*   It's recommended to work from a computer for better overview and agility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   Only use the mobile phone if you are absolutely clear on the operations to be carried out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Be very attentive to prices and market fluctuations, as assets are highly volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   Exercise extreme caution with [[benefits_of_using_leverage_in_binance_futures | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

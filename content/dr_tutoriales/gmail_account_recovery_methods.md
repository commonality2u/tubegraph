This article outlines methods for recovering a forgotten Gmail account or password. A vital step in either process is to attempt recovery from a device (computer or mobile phone) that has previously accessed the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Google uses this access history as a reference to verify identity and facilitate recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## Recovering a Forgotten Gmail Account

If you have forgotten your Gmail account username, there are two primary methods to retrieve it:

### 1. Using Browser Settings
If you have previously accessed your Gmail account from your current device, you might be able to find your email and password saved in your browser's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This method is considered "Method 1" and is described as super powerful and interesting if you have a device you've accessed before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

#### Steps:
1.  Open a new tab in your web browser (e.g., Google Chrome) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
2.  Go to **Settings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.
3.  Navigate to the **Autofill** section and then select **Passwords** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.
4.  In the search bar, type "gmail" to filter for saved Gmail accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
5.  A list of all saved Gmail accounts and passwords will appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
6.  Click on the eye icon next to an entry to reveal the password. You may be prompted to enter your computer's PIN or password <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
7.  The email account and password will be displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

[[using_browser_settings_for_email_recovery | This method]] also works for retrieving forgotten passwords if they were saved in the browser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### 2. Using an Associated Recovery Option
If the browser settings method doesn't work, Google offers alternative recovery options through a designated link if you've forgotten your email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

#### Steps:
1.  On the Gmail sign-in page, click on the "Forgot email" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.
2.  You will be prompted to enter a phone number or a secondary recovery email associated with the forgotten account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
    *   It is recommended to set up a secondary Gmail email for recovery purposes to avoid risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
3.  Enter the recovery email or phone number.
4.  Enter the first and last names associated with the recovery email <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>.
5.  Google will send a verification code to the recovery email or phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
6.  Follow the instructions in the verification message to regain access to your original account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>.

## Recovering a Forgotten Gmail Password

If you remember your Gmail email address but have forgotten the password, Google provides several methods to help you regain access.

### 1. Using Browser Settings (Reiterated)
As mentioned above, if you have previously accessed the account from your device, your password might be saved in your browser's settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Follow the steps outlined in the [[using_browser_settings_for_email_recovery | "Using Browser Settings" section]] above.

### 2. Entering a Previously Used Password
When attempting to log in, if you indicate you've forgotten your password, Google may ask you to enter a password you have previously used for that Gmail account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Google can recognize if you've used that password before and may allow you to recover access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

### 3. Verification Email to an Associated Account
Google can send a verification email to a secondary Gmail account that is associated with the one you're trying to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This is a very similar and powerful process to recovering a forgotten email address <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### 4. Using Another Email Account
If you don't have an associated recovery email, Google offers the option to enter another email account, even one that is not associated with your Gmail account (e.g., a family member's email) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. Google will attempt to contact you through this provided email to assist with password recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>.

### 5. Answering Security Questions
As a last resort, if other methods are unsuccessful, Google may require you to answer a series of [[google_security_questions_for_account_recovery | security questions]] related to your account or personal information that you provided when setting up the account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. These questions are typically details you are expected to remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

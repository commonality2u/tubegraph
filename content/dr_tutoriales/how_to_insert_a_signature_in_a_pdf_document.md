This tutorial demonstrates how to [[adding_signatures_to_pdfs | insert a signature within a PDF file]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Prerequisites

Before beginning, ensure you have:
*   The PDF file you wish to sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.
*   Your signature in an image format (e.g., scanned or photographed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, or be prepared to create it using text or drawing tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Steps to Sign a PDF Document

Follow these [[steps_to_fill_out_and_sign_pdf_documents | steps to fill out and sign PDF documents]]:

### 1. Open the PDF File
Open the PDF document you intend to sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### 2. Access the "Fill & Sign" Option
Once the PDF is open, navigate to the "Fill out and [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | sign]]" option, which typically appears on the right side of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This option provides choices to fill out, [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | sign]], and send, or to obtain signatures from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Select "[[steps_to_fill_out_and_sign_pdf_documents | fill and sign]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### 3. Position the Signature
Scroll to the desired location within the document where you wish to place your [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | signature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### 4. Choose Signature Type
You have several [[options_for_signing_pdfs_including_text_and_image_signatures | options for signing PDFs including text and image signatures]]:
*   **Text Signature:** You can [[options_for_signing_pdfs_including_text_and_image_signatures | write text]] directly, such as your name, and choose from various available styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Draw Signature:** You can [[options_for_signing_pdfs_including_text_and_image_signatures | draw it]] directly using your computer's tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Image Signature:** You can [[options_for_signing_pdfs_including_text_and_image_signatures | include a signature that has been scanned]] or photographed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If using your own [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | signature]], it should be [[techniques_to_scan_and_add_signatures_to_pdfs | scanned]] or photographed and transferred to your computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To add an image signature:
1.  Click on "[[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | Sign]]" at the top right of the screen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
2.  Select "Add a [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | signature]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.
3.  Choose to [[options_for_signing_pdfs_including_text_and_image_signatures | select an image]] in image format from your desktop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.
4.  Once selected, the [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | signature]] will appear on the document and can be resized (bigger or smaller) and moved to the exact desired position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### 5. Save the Signed Document
Once the [[using_digital_signatures_in_pdf_files | signature]] is in place, go to "File" and select "Save As" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Provide a new name for the file, for example, "File Name + Signature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, and save it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The document is now signed and saved as a new PDF file <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

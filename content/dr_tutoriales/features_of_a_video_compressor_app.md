Video compressor applications are essential for [[reducing_video_file_size_for_easier_transfer | reducing video file size for easier transfer]], especially when needing to [[how_to_compress_videos_for_whatsapp | compress videos to send by WhatsApp]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Not all videos can be sent due to capacity limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Selecting a Video Compressor App

To begin the [[step_by_step_guide_on_using_a_video_compressor | video compression process]], you'll need to download a video compressor app from an app store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. When choosing among the available [[video_compression_apps_for_mobile_devices | video compression apps for mobile devices]], consider these features:

*   **Ease of Use** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>: Look for an app that is user-friendly.
*   **Minimal Advertising** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>: An app with fewer ads provides a smoother experience.
*   **Low Payment Requirements** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>: Opt for apps that don't require extensive payments for basic functions.

## Core Features and Usage

Once the application is opened, it typically provides an option to compress a video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

### Video Selection
Users can select a video directly from their device's video gallery for compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Compression Settings
The app allows users to define the compression percentage, indicating how much they wish to compress the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. For instance, selecting "85%" means the compressed video will be 85% of its original size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. A higher percentage typically means less compression, while a lower percentage (e.g., 70%) results in greater file size reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This feature is crucial for [[comparison_of_compression_settings | comparison of compression settings]].

The app aims to reduce video size while [[maintaining_video_quality_while_compressing | maintaining quality limits]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### Compression Modes
*   **Normal Mode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>: Automatically reduces rates, simplifying the process.
*   **Advanced Mode** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>: Allows for manual adjustments for more precise control over compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

### Compression Process
After setting the desired compression level, the app initiates the compression. This process typically takes between 20 to 30 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Saving the Compressed Video
Once compressed, the video can be saved directly to the device's gallery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This is part of the [[exporting_and_saving_compressed_video_files | exporting and saving compressed video files]] functionality.

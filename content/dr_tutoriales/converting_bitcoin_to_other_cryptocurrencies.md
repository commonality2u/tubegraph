This guide outlines how to convert Bitcoin (BTC) to other cryptocurrencies and national currencies within the Binance platform, including withdrawing funds to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Initial Setup and Recommendations

Upon entering Binance, ensure you have Bitcoin in your account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It is generally recommended to [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | convert Bitcoin to another cryptocurrency]] rather than directly to a national currency, as national currencies tend to devalue over time compared to cryptocurrencies, potentially leading to greater profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. However, if the goal is to withdraw capital from the platform, conversion to a national currency is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Converting Bitcoin to National Currency (e.g., Euros)

To [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | convert Bitcoin to a national currency]] like euros:
1.  Navigate to a relevant market, such as "BTC Euro" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This will open a chart displaying Bitcoin's value against the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
2.  On the market page, select the "Sell Bitcoin" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
3.  Enter the amount of Bitcoin you wish to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The minimum amount for a sell order is 10 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
4.  You can choose to place a limit order or a market order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.
5.  Confirm the sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The converted euros will then appear in your wallet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Converting Other Cryptocurrencies to Fiat

Some cryptocurrencies cannot be directly converted to euros (e.g., Volkswat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. In such cases, a two-step process is required:
1.  First, convert the cryptocurrency to Bitcoin or a stablecoin like Dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
2.  Then, from Bitcoin (or the stablecoin), [[exchanging_bitcoin_to_national_currencies_like_euros_or_dollars | transfer it to your national currency]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This ensures any cryptocurrency can ultimately be converted to fiat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Withdrawing National Currency to a Bank Account

After converting your Bitcoin (or other cryptocurrencies) to national currency on Binance, you can [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency | withdraw these funds to your bank account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
1.  Go to the "Wallet" section of your Binance account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
2.  Select the "Withdraw" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
3.  Choose your currency (e.g., Euro) and the payment method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
4.  **Bank Transfer** is recommended over bank card due to lower commissions (0.8 commission for bank transfer vs. higher for bank card) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Minimum withdrawal amount for bank transfer is 3 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
    *   Maximum withdrawal amount for bank transfer is 50,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   Enter the desired amount, your IBAN, and bank account details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Funds are typically deposited within one to two business days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
5.  **Bank Card Withdrawal** is faster (up to 30 minutes) but incurs higher commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   Minimum withdrawal amount for bank card is 10 euros, maximum is 5,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

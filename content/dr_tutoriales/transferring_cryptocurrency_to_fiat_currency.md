This guide explains how to withdraw capital from the MetaMask platform to your bank account safely and reliably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The process involves an intermediary centralized exchange, as direct withdrawals from MetaMask to a bank account are not possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Overall Process

The general flow for [[transferring_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency | transferring cryptocurrency to fiat currency]] is:
1.  **MetaMask** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
2.  **Centralized Exchange** (e.g., Binance, Coinbase, Kraken) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
3.  **Bank Account** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>

## Choosing a Centralized Exchange

An intermediary centralized exchange is necessary to facilitate the transfer of cryptocurrency from MetaMask to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

*   **Examples of Exchanges**: Coinbase, Binance, Q Coin, Kraken, Crypto.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Key Requirement**: The chosen centralized exchange must allow SEPA transfers from its platform to your bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
*   **Recommended Exchange**: Binance is used in this tutorial as it permits SEPA transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Kraken or Coinbase can also be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.
*   **Withdrawal Fees**:
    *   Binance: Charges approximately one euro for transfers to a bank account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
    *   Kraken or Coinbase: May offer zero-fee withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.
*   **Referral Links**: Referral links for creating accounts on these platforms, which may offer bonuses or discounts on commissions, are available in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

## Choosing a Bank Account

Not all conventional banks (e.g., Santander, BBVA) accept withdrawals from centralized exchanges; transfers may be blocked, and funds returned to the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Recommended Neobanks**: Revolut or N26 are recommended neobanks that facilitate transactions with these types of exchanges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.
*   **Further Resources**: Video tutorials on how to use these neobanks and their associated benefits are linked in the first comment of the video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Step-by-Step: [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_binance | Transferring from Binance to Bank Account]]

Once your capital is on the Binance platform, you can now [[withdrawing_fiat_and_cryptocurrencies_from_binance | withdraw it to your bank account]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This process involves [[converting_cryptocurrencies_within_binance | converting the cryptocurrency to fiat currency]].

1.  **Convert Cryptocurrency to Fiat Currency**:
    *   Go to the "Trading Markets" section on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Select the "Convert" option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
    *   Choose the cryptocurrency you wish to convert (e.g., USDT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
    *   Select the fiat currency you want to convert it to (e.g., Euro) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Preview the conversion; there are often no commissions for this transaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
    *   Confirm the conversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
2.  **Initiate Fiat Withdrawal**:
    *   Go to "Wallet" > "Spot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
    *   Tap "Withdraw" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Select "Withdraw Fiat" (not "Cryptocurrency withdrawal") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.
    *   Choose "Bank Transfer" (SEPA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   Select the fiat currency you wish to withdraw (e.g., Euro, Australian Dollar, Russian Ruble, Uruguayan Peso) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    *   Review the fees: typically 1 euro for bank transfers on Binance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   You can also [[converting_cryptocurrency_to_fiat_currency_on_coinbase | withdraw via bank card]], but this usually incurs a higher commission (e.g., 1.8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Proceed with the withdrawal, ensuring you are using a compatible bank account like Revolut or N26 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

> [!TIP] Using specific neobanks like Revolut or N26 is highly recommended for these transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

This process, while somewhat lengthy, is straightforward once understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Understanding Trading Pairs
It is crucial to understand the order of assets in a trading pair, as it determines what you buy or sell [00:02:51].
*   If the cryptocurrency you want to acquire appears first in the pair (e.g., UESS/DIE), selecting "buy" will purchase the first asset (UESS) [00:02:56].
*   If the cryptocurrency you want to acquire appears second (e.g., DIE/UESS), selecting "buy" will purchase the first asset (DIE), and you would need to "sell" the first asset (DIE) to acquire the second asset (UESS) [00:03:03].
*   When you select "buy," you are buying the first asset listed in the pair. When you select "sell," you are selling the first asset listed in the pair [00:03:17]. Always consider this when operating [00:03:22].

## Buying Cryptocurrencies on Binance Exchange (Desktop)

This section describes how to [[buying_and_selling_cryptocurrencies_on_binance | buy and sell cryptocurrencies on Binance]] using the desktop interface.

### Finding a Cryptocurrency (e.g., UESS)
1.  Navigate to the "Markets" section [00:01:06].
2.  Go to the "Zones" part and ensure "all" is selected to find available cryptocurrencies [00:01:10].
3.  If "UESS" (a cryptocurrency that follows the behavior of the dollar [00:01:33]) is not visible, use the magnifying glass icon to search for it by typing "UESS" [00:01:21].

### Initiating a Trade
1.  Select the desired trading pair (e.g., UESS/DIE, UESS/Bitcoin, UESS/Euros) [00:02:00, 00:02:07]. The chosen pair will open in a new tab with a graph [00:01:50].
2.  Go to the "buy" section [00:03:40].

### Choosing an Order Type
*   **Market Order:** This order type buys at the current market price [00:03:44]. If you click "buy" with a market order, it executes at the prevailing price (e.g., 0.9985) [00:03:51].
*   **Limit Order and Stop Limit Order:** These are orders at a fixed price chosen by the user, which execute automatically when the market price reaches that chosen level [00:03:57]. For more details on these, consult the dedicated tutorials [00:04:06].

### Executing a Market Order
1.  Select "Market Order" for instant execution at the current market price [00:04:15].
2.  Specify the quantity of the cryptocurrency you wish to buy (e.g., 100 UESS) [00:04:22]. You can enter the amount in the cryptocurrency you want to buy or the total amount you wish to spend in the base currency (e.g., DIE) [00:04:22].
3.  Click "buy" to complete the transaction [00:04:32]. If you have the required amount in your wallet, the purchase will be completed [00:04:34].

### Navigating the App
1.  Ensure you have the Binance application installed on your mobile device [00:05:03].
2.  Open the application [00:05:10].
3.  Go to the "Markets" section from the bottom menu [00:05:15].
4.  Use the filter and search function to find the desired cryptocurrency, such as "UESS" [00:05:19].
5.  Navigate to the "Spot" section to see available exchanges for "UESS" [00:05:27].

### Executing a Trade (e.g., Acquiring UESS from Bitcoin)
1.  Choose a trading pair where UESS appears in the second position (e.g., Bitcoin/UESS) [00:05:37, 00:05:49].
2.  To acquire UESS when Bitcoin is the first asset in the pair, you must "sell" Bitcoin [00:06:03, 00:06:13].
3.  Scroll down to find the "buy" and "sell" options [00:05:57].
4.  Select "Sell" [00:06:19].
5.  Choose "Market Order" [00:06:22].
6.  Enter the quantity of Bitcoin you want to sell (or the total value in UESS you wish to receive) [00:06:27].
7.  Click "Sell Bitcoin" to acquire UESS [00:06:34]. An "order failed" message may appear if insufficient funds are available [00:06:37]. This process allows you to acquire cryptocurrencies from your mobile phone whenever needed [00:06:48].

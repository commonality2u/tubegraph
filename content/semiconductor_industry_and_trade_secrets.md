The semiconductor industry is characterized by intense competition and rapid technological advancement, making trade secrets and specialized knowledge highly valuable assets. This article explores the nature of these secrets, how they are acquired, and their impact on companies and geopolitical dynamics, based on insights from a podcast discussion.

## Acquisition of Trade Secrets and Talent

The pursuit of technological parity or superiority in the semiconductor industry often involves various methods of acquiring crucial information and expertise.

### Espionage and Information Gathering
Countries seeking to catch up in semiconductor technology may resort to systematic information gathering. If a nation like China were "scale-pilled" (i.e., heavily focused on scaling up its capabilities), one hypothetical strategy would involve contacting every Chinese national with family back home to acquire information, recipes, and supplier details from foreign entities [[security_risks_and_statelevel_espionage_in_ai_development | Security risks and state-level espionage in AI development]]. This could extend to all sectors, including lab and hardware foreigners.

An analogy was drawn to Yugoslavia's nuclear weapons program, which started with minimal indigenous knowledge. The state's secret police facilitated the acquisition of necessary information and resources over a four-year period by fulfilling a list of needs compiled by a key expert.

China has reportedly been hacking ASML, a key supplier of lithography equipment, for over five years, though ASML has downplayed the impact. It is believed that China may already possess ASML's files, but the manufacturing process remains extremely difficult.

### Poaching Talent
A significant method for acquiring semiconductor expertise is by poaching talent [[talent_spotting_and_evaluation_in_various_domains | Talent spotting and evaluation in various domains]]. Taiwanese nationals, particularly those working at industry leader TSMC, are targets. Because TSMC employees may not earn "absurd amounts of money," they can be lured with offers of a better life. Many employees at Chinese semiconductor firm SMIC are former TSMC Taiwanese nationals, including high-ranking, skilled individuals. This talent flow from Taiwan has been a key factor in accelerating China's semiconductor industry.

## Key Individuals and Case Studies

Several notable instances highlight the impact of talent movement and alleged trade secret transfers:

### Richard Chang
Richard Chang, formerly of Taiwanese company Worldwide Semiconductor, which was acquired by TSMC, moved to China with the intention of bringing religion there. Relations between China and Taiwan were different at the time. In Shanghai, he was offered significant funding and subsequently recruited a large number of Taiwanese professionals who relocated to China, contributing to the growth of its semiconductor sector.

### Liang Mong Song
Liang Mong Song is described as a "literal genius" with numerous patents, formerly a top R&D figure at TSMC. After losing an internal power struggle for the head of R&D position and being demoted, he moved to Samsung, taking a "conga line" of talent from TSMC with him. Some of these individuals were reportedly paid more than the Samsung chairman.

Liang's focus at Samsung was to reach the leading edge, disregarding incremental improvements. This effort led Samsung to win a significant portion of Apple's business back from TSMC. At one point, Samsung was considered better than TSMC due to his contributions.

TSMC, under Morris Chang, responded fiercely with the "Nightingale Army"â€”a relentless R&D effort with day and night shifts, metaphorically "burning your liver". This initiative led to the completion of FinFET technology, allowing TSMC [[china_and_the_uss_race_in_ai_and_superintelligence | China and the US's race in AI and superintelligence]] to surpass Samsung. Simultaneously, TSMC sued Liang Mong Song for stealing trade secrets. Samsung subsequently distanced itself from Liang, who then moved to SMIC in China. SMIC experienced rapid improvement following Liang's arrival.

## Nature of Semiconductor Knowledge

Semiconductor manufacturing knowledge is highly specialized and often tacit.

### Compartmentalization and Specialization
Knowledge within semiconductor fabs is very compartmentalized. Engineers often focus on very specific areas, such as an etch engineer specializing in how hydrogen fluoride etches particular materials under different conditions (pressure, temperature, chemical recipes). These experts may not even know about the end chip. This deep specialization means that often, "nobody knows the whole stack" [[challenges_and_limitations_in_ai_interpretability_and_safety | Challenges and limitations in AI interpretability and safety]]. Tool companies may not know exactly how Intel or TSMC use their tools in production, and vice versa.

### Master-Apprentice Model
The transmission of critical knowledge, particularly in areas like etch processes, has been described as a "master-apprentice" system. This "secret knowledge" is passed down through generations. It's suggested that America lost some of this capability as apprentices stopped coming, with many eventually moving to Taiwan where this model persists, for example, at National Tsing Hua University (NTHU). A lot of knowledge is based on an "amazing amount of intuition" built over decades of experience.

### Research and Development
Developing the next process node involves extensive experimentation. TSMC's recipes are the culmination of years of highly secret research. R&D involves PhDs in chemistry, physics, and electrical engineering, who run experiments on specific parts of the process, adjusting variables like pressure or chemical composition, and measuring outcomes like yield, performance, and power in a multivariable search space [[challenges_and_advancements_in_ai_training_techniques | Challenges and advancements in AI training techniques]].

## Value of Trade Secrets

The most valuable information in the semiconductor industry could be blueprints from companies like TSMC (fab recipes), NVIDIA (chip design), or ASML (equipment design). However, even with access to blueprints or recipes, successfully implementing them is extremely challenging [[limitations_of_large_language_models_llms_in_solving_novel_tasks | Limitations of large language models (LLMs) in solving novel tasks]].

## Challenges in Information Control

Despite efforts to control the flow of sensitive semiconductor technology, challenges persist.

### Export Controls
Export controls aim to restrict China from building a domestic chip manufacturing industry superior to what Western companies can sell them, and ultimately, from developing superior AI. However, there's a view that these controls may be flawed because China can currently build better chips domestically than the restricted chips NVIDIA or AMD can sell to them, partly due to the equipment they are still able to import. For instance, SMIC is still buying tools usable for 7nm and 5.5nm processes, claiming they are for older nodes like 28nm, while allegedly using them for advanced nodes in locations like Beijing.

The argument is made that incremental restrictions ("taking one jigsaw puzzle piece out") allow China to focus on developing domestic replacements for those specific pieces, strengthening their overall industry over time. Some believe it's impossible to stop the Chinese semiconductor industry from progressing due to the government's strong belief in its primacy [[geopolitical_implications_on_technology_and_data_centers | Geopolitical Implications on Technology and Data Centers]].

### Information Accessibility
Unlike AI, where much state-of-the-art research was, until recently, publicly available on platforms like ArXiv, semiconductor knowledge has been highly proprietary and "shut down since the 1970s". Access to technical papers from organizations like IEEE or SPIE is often restricted. This makes it difficult for outsiders or even those in different parts of the semiconductor stack to gain a comprehensive understanding.

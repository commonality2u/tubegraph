This article discusses the concept of complementary innovations and their crucial role in technological progress, drawing insights from a podcast discussion with Tamay Besiroglu and Ege Erdil.

## The "Intelligence Explosion" as a Misleading Concept

Tamay Besiroglu argues that the concept of an "intelligence explosion" is not very useful for understanding the development and impact of Artificial Intelligence (AI) [[intelligence_explosion_and_its_implications | intelligence explosion and its implications]][[intelligence_explosion_and_ai_feedback_loops | intelligence explosion and AI feedback loops]]. He likens it to calling the Industrial Revolution a "horsepower explosion". While raw physical power (horsepower) did see a drastic acceleration during the Industrial Revolution, focusing solely on this aspect would miss many other equally, if not more, important factors that contributed to the acceleration of growth and technological change. Similarly, while AI development will produce very smart AI systems, these will be just one part among many interconnected moving parts driving future transitions and growth.

## Lessons from the Industrial Revolution

The Industrial Revolution provides a historical analogy for understanding the importance of complementary changes. The transformation was not solely due to increased horsepower but resulted from a multitude of simultaneous innovations across various sectors:
* **Agriculture:** Innovations increased food production.
* **Transportation:** New methods facilitated the movement of goods and people.
* **Law and Finance:** Evolving systems supported new economic activities.
* **Urbanization:** The shift from rural areas to cities changed societal organization. These complementary innovations collectively changed the way society was economically organized, rather than just one factor like horsepower being the central driver.

## Complementary Factors in AI Development and Deployment

The development and impact of AI are similarly reliant on a broad set of complementary factors, rather than solely on the "intelligence" of AI models [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity | impact of AI on software development and productivity]][[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society | impact of AI on future technology and society]][[economic_impacts_of_ai_and_automation | economic impacts of AI and automation]].

### AI Research and Development (R&D)
Progress in AI R&D is not just a matter of cognitive effort but is heavily intertwined with other inputs:
* **Compute Scaling:** A significant driver of software progress in AI has been the scaling of compute (e.g., GPUs) [[role_of_compute_in_ai_development | role of compute in AI development]]. More compute allows for more experiments at larger scales. The acceleration in AI progress during the deep learning era coincided with an acceleration in compute scaling.
* **Hardware-Related Innovations:** Many key AI innovations, like the Transformer architecture and Flash Attention, were motivated by the need to harness parallel compute more effectively or improve hardware efficiency [[innovations_and_challenges_in_ai_hardware | innovations and challenges in AI hardware]].
* **Concentration of Resources:** Algorithmic and architectural innovations are often concentrated in GPU-rich labs, highlighting the importance of hardware access.
* **Data:** The existence of vast datasets (e.g., the internet) has been crucial for training large models. Without this, achieving current capabilities would be very difficult.

The "software-only singularity" idea is critiqued because it underplays the need for these complementary inputs [[ai_alignment_and_safety_concerns | AI alignment and safety concerns]]. Progress requires scaling multiple factors simultaneously, not just improving software efficiency in isolation.

### Broader Economic Transformation
For AI to drive substantial economic growth and societal transformation, complementary developments across the economy are necessary [[economic_and_societal_impacts_of_ai_progress | economic and societal impacts of AI progress]]:
* **Infrastructure and Supply Chains:** Building out AI capabilities, much like the "Shenzhen in the desert" analogy for a robot-driven economy, relies on existing and upgraded infrastructure, including semiconductor supply chains and material inputs [[investments_and_economic_strategies_in_tech_development | investments and economic strategies in tech development]]. 
* **Wide Deployment and Data Collection:** The most efficient way to gather new data and unlock new competencies for AI systems may involve broad deployment into the economy, allowing systems to learn from real-world interactions (e.g., user feedback for ChatGPT) [[challenges_and_benefits_of_aigenerated_content_and_virtual_assistants | challenges and benefits of AI-generated content and virtual assistants]].
* **Demand and Market Size:** A sufficiently large economy is needed to create demand for new products and services, justifying specialization and the fixed costs of R&D [[challenges_and_opportunities_in_deploying_ai_at_scale | challenges and opportunities in deploying AI at scale]].

## The Limits of Abstract Reasoning
The discussion emphasizes that abstract reasoning alone is often insufficient for progress. Making contact with the real world through experiments, deployment, and observation is crucial. This is because:
* The real world possesses an enormous amount of richness and detail that cannot be fully captured by reasoning alone [[mechanistic_interpretability_in_ai | mechanistic interpretability in AI]].
* Many insights are gained through the process of building and deploying technologies, which then informs further innovation. Historical attempts at prediction based purely on reasoning about new technologies can be significantly flawed, as exemplified by the inaccurate forecasts of casualties from aerial bombardment before World War II.

## Bottlenecks to Progress
Even with advanced AI, several factors related to complementarity can act as bottlenecks [[cost_disease_and_economic_bottlenecks | cost disease and economic bottlenecks]]:
* **Slow-Moving Sectors (Baumol's Cost Disease):** If AI dramatically improves productivity in some sectors but not others (which act as essential complements), overall growth might be constrained by the slowest-improving sectors. However, this requires quantitative specificity about which sectors and the strength of complementarities.
* **O-Ring Production Functions:** If economic output relies on a series of tasks where the failure or inefficiency of one component (even a human-performed one) cripples the entire process, this could limit growth if that component cannot be improved or substituted by AI.
* **Regulation:** Global or national regulations could significantly slow down the deployment of AI or its complementary technologies, even if the technology itself is ready [[challenges_in_ai_governance | challenges in AI governance]].
* **Deployment Lags:** The time it takes for businesses to adapt their processes, integrate AI into existing supply chains, and for markets to respond to new AI-driven products and services can inherently take time, even if AI models themselves improve rapidly. However, if AIs can act as "drop-in" replacements for workers, this lag might be shorter.

## Conclusion
The advancement and societal impact of AI, much like previous technological revolutions, will depend on a wide array of complementary innovations and the scaling of various economic inputs [[ai_scalability_and_breakthroughs | AI scalability and breakthroughs]]. Focusing solely on AI's "intelligence" overlooks the complex interplay of technology, infrastructure, economic structures, and real-world deployment that collectively drive progress. Understanding these complementarities is essential for realistic forecasting and for navigating the transition to a more AI-driven future [[exploring_the_future_of_society_and_economy_with_ai | exploring the future of society and economy with AI]].

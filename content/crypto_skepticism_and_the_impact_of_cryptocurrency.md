Patrick McKenzie, also known as patio11, expressed significant skepticism regarding the societal value and impact of cryptocurrency, particularly when weighed against its costs and proclaimed potential. This article outlines his perspectives based on the podcast discussion.

## The True Cost and Resource Allocation of Cryptocurrency
McKenzie argues that the true cost of cryptocurrency to society extends beyond its market capitalization, which at its peak was around $3 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. He emphasizes the consumption of "rivalrous resources" – resources that could have been applied to other societal needs. These include:
*   GPUs and ASICs (Application-Specific Integrated Circuits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>
*   Electricity, such as that used for mining operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a> – see more on [[data_center_energy_requirements_and_scaling | data center energy requirements and scaling]].
*   The time and talent of intelligent individuals who could have been developing other software products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:53">[01:00:53]</a>.

He estimates this resource expenditure to be in the "tens of billions or hundreds of billions of dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:02">[01:01:02]</a>.

## Evaluating Crypto's Utility and Promises

### Vitalik Buterin's 2017 Challenge
McKenzie references Vitalik Buterin's 2017 questioning of whether crypto had "truly earned" its then $0.5 trillion valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:18">[01:01:18]</a>. Buterin's questions included:
*   How many of the unbanked have been genuinely banked? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>
*   How many distributed applications are providing meaningful value? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>

McKenzie poses these same questions for 2024, implying that satisfactory answers proportionate to the resources invested are still lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.

### The Persistent "Early Days" Narrative
A recurring theme in the crypto space, according to McKenzie, is the notion that "you can still get in early because the value has not arrived yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. He predicts that even by 2030, the narrative might remain that crypto has not yet achieved its true potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:04">[01:06:04]</a>. He characterizes the development so far as a "capital-F failure" if it were any other tech company, given the resources staked versus the outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a>.

### Use Case: International Payments
When presented with the example of international contractors preferring payment in USDC (a stablecoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>, McKenzie acknowledges this as evidence of a payment rail for some tech-savvy individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. However, he questions the cost-effectiveness, suggesting that the tens or hundreds of billions invested could have, for instance, funded a significant lobbying campaign to improve existing AML (Anti-Money Laundering) and KYC (Know Your Customer) regulations for easier global money transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>.

### The Dot-Com Bubble Analogy
The comparison to the dot-com bubble, where massive investment in infrastructure like fiber optic cables eventually paid off despite many initial company failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:47">[01:04:47]</a>, is met with caution. McKenzie asks at what future date crypto's success or failure based on this analogy should be judged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:28">[01:05:28]</a>.

### Programmable Money and Practicality
While acknowledging the intellectual appeal of "programmable money," McKenzie states that "money is programmable money" already <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>. He compares some aspects of crypto's technical intrigue to building a computer in Minecraft using redstone: intellectually edifying and educational, but not a practical foundation for global computational infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:13">[01:07:13]</a>.

## Cryptocurrency as a Check on Financial Surveillance

### Critique of KYC/AML Regimes
McKenzie expresses sympathy for the argument that crypto could serve as a hedge against government overreach via KYC/AML regulations and potential de-banking based on political activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>. He agrees that the banking system effectively acts as a "policy arm of the government" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:15">[01:08:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:40">[01:08:40]</a>. He describes the current KYC/AML framework, dating back to the Bank Secrecy Act, as having evolved into a system of transaction-level surveillance where banks employ intelligence analyst-sized teams to sift through millions of alerts, writing memos that are rarely read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:48">[01:09:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:06">[01:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:31">[01:10:31]</a>. He believes this current state of affairs would likely not have been accepted by the American polity if fully explained in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>.

### Crypto's Stance on Privacy vs. Growth
Despite the potential privacy advantages, McKenzie observes a tendency within the crypto ecosystem: while privacy is often touted, when faced with a choice between privacy and integrating with the traditional banking system (seen as necessary for "number go up"), the latter is frequently chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>. He notes that protocols specifically focused on privacy constitute a "very tiny portion of crypto" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:49">[01:11:49]</a>.

## Financial Operations in Crypto: The SBF Case
McKenzie refers to Sam Bankman-Fried (SBF) as an example of sophistication in financial operations within the crypto sphere, particularly in moving large sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:50">[01:33:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>. He highlights:
*   Alameda Research, linked to SBF, moved "tens of billions of dollars of cash around the financial system," largely on behalf of Tether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:11">[01:36:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:22">[01:36:22]</a> – a process often scrutinized under [[money_laundering_and_financial_fraud_in_the_tech_industry | money laundering and financial fraud in the tech industry]].
*   SBF's own account of the founding of Alameda involved an arbitrage opportunity between Japan and the U.S., which McKenzie interprets as SBF having "suborned a Japanese bank" to facilitate these transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:58">[01:34:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>. McKenzie notes SBF's comment that such activity would "look like the sketchiest thing in the world" to a compliance person, adding "because it is money laundering" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:27">[01:35:27]</a>.

## Unfulfilled Potential and Ongoing Skepticism
Overall, McKenzie's perspective is one of significant skepticism regarding crypto's achievements relative to the resources consumed and the promises made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a>. He challenges the crypto community to provide clear answers to the fundamental questions of value creation, such as those posed by Vitalik Buterin, before further substantial investment of societal resources is justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>. Additionally, exploring the [[speculation_and_investment_in_cryptocurrency_and_digital_assets | speculation and investment in cryptocurrency and digital assets]] can lead to a better understanding of their market dynamics.

## The Assassination

On November 22, 1963, President Kennedy was assassinated while traveling in a motorcade through Dealey Plaza in Dallas, Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The shots that killed President Kennedy were believed to have been fired from the [[events_at_the_texas_school_book_depository_on_november_22_1963 | Texas School Book Depository]], where Oswald worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Lee Harvey Oswald

### Employment at the Book Depository

Oswald began working at the Texas School Book Depository on October 16, 1963, having secured the job through a somewhat coincidental sequence of events involving his wife and acquaintances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. His employment was temporary and arose from a staff shortage rather than a calculated plan to place him there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### The Day of the Assassination

On the morning of the assassination, Oswald was seen by coworkers carrying a package, which he claimed contained curtain rods. This package is believed to have actually contained the rifle used in the assassination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Witnesses provided conflicting testimonies regarding Oswald's actions that day, with significant debate about his movements inside the Book Depository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### The Shooting

Multiple witnesses reported seeing someone with a rifle in the Depository around the time of the shooting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>. However, the evidence was largely circumstantial, and no one could definitively place Oswald at the scene during the shooting, leading to ongoing debates about [[debate_over_the_involvement_of_other_parties_in_the_jfk_assassination | his potential involvement and guilt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:02">[01:29:02]</a>.

### Aftermath and Arrest

After the assassination, Oswald left the Book Depository and made his way to a cinema where he was arrested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. He was charged with the murder of President Kennedy and Dallas Police Officer J.D. Tippit, whom he allegedly shot later that afternoon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.

## Theories and Controversies

Despite the Warren Commission's conclusion that Oswald acted alone, many Americans believe that there was a [[conspiracy_theories_surrounding_jfks_assassination | conspiracy to assassinate Kennedy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Numerous inconsistencies in [[testimonies_and_discrepancies_in_witness_accounts | witness testimonies]] and the handling of evidence have fueled various conspiracy theories. These include the possibility of multiple gunmen and allegations of tampering and misconduct by authorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:09">[01:18:09]</a>.

## Conclusion

The assassination of John F. Kennedy and the subsequent investigation into Lee Harvey Oswald's involvement form a complicated narrative that continues to captivate the public. The event not only altered the course of American history but remains a deeply puzzling chapter, inviting continuous scrutiny and debate over the past six decades.

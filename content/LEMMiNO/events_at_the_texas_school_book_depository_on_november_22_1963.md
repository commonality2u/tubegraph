On November 22, 1963, the Texas School Book Depository in Dallas, Texas, became a focal point in one of the most significant events in American history: the [[the_kennedy_assassination_and_lee_harvey_oswald | assassination of President John F. Kennedy]]. The building, a seven-story structure where [[the_kennedy_assassination_and_lee_harvey_oswald | Lee Harvey Oswald]] was employed, played a crucial role in the tragic event that unfolded that day.

## Employment at the Depository

Lee Harvey Oswald's employment at the Texas School Book Depository was arranged in a somewhat roundabout manner. In mid-September 1963, Wesley Frazier was hired at the Depository through an acquaintance of Marina Oswald, Lee's wife, who was staying with a woman named Ruth Paine. This ultimately led to Roy Truly, the building's superintendent, hiring Oswald on the spot on October 16, 1963 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Preceding the Assassination

Oswald typically commuted between Irving, Texas, and Dallas with Frazier. However, on Thursday, November 21, 1963, he deviated from this routine by unexpectedly returning to Irving, causing surprise to both Paine and Marina Oswald <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The next morning, Oswald departed with a package claimed to contain curtain rods, which he brought back to Dallas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

## The Morning of the Assassination

The morning of November 22 began normally at the Depository. Employees on the sixth floor were preparing to install a new plywood floor and witnessed Oswald's movements throughout the building <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. Around noon, Oswald was last observed by Charles Givens on the sixth floor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

## The Shooting

The shots that [[testimonies_and_discrepancies_in_witness_accounts | killed President Kennedy]] were fired at approximately 12:30 PM from the southeast corner of the sixth floor of the Depository, the suspected Sniper's Nest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Several witnesses later reported seeing a gun in the sixth floor windows or hearing the shots originating from the direction of the Depository <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

## Immediate Aftermath

Shortly after the shots were fired, Dallas motorcycle policeman Marrion Baker rushed into the building and, along with Superintendent Roy Truly, encountered Oswald in the second-floor lunchroom. Oswald appeared calm and was allowed to continue unchallenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

Truly discovered that Oswald was missing during a roll call conducted after the shooting. Meanwhile, police discovered significant [[investigation_and_challenges_faced_by_the_police | evidence on the sixth floor]], including three spent cartridge cases and a bolt-action rifle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The rifle was later linked to Oswald via fingerprints and a documented purchase made under an alias <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:10">[01:03:10]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite aspects of the event remaining shrouded in mystery and [[conspiracy_theories_surrounding_jfks_assassination | controversy]], the Texas School Book Depository served as the origin point for the assassination of President Kennedy. Oswald's actions and the chaotic aftermath have fueled numerous investigations and [[debate_over_the_involvement_of_other_parties_in_the_jfk_assassination | conspiracy theories]] regarding the events of that day.

This article details the rise of Mao Zedong and his subsequent impact on China, based on an analysis of his theories and actions. The information is drawn from a presentation referencing Stuart Schram's *Collected Works of Mao* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. The views expressed are those of the presenter and do not necessarily represent official US government positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Introduction: Significance of Mao

Mao Zedong is described as an "incredibly consequential figure" of the 20th century and one of the most important figures in all of Chinese history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. He is also recognized as a "terribly significant military-political theorist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> whose theories have been used by various groups to take over failing states and assert dictatorial rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The presenter also controversially labels him "probably the most brilliant and most famous psychopath in human history" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Mao's theories gained traction in the decolonizing world after World War II, particularly in agricultural and underdeveloped nations who saw his model as more relevant than the Soviet one, given Russia's industrial base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

## Historical Context: The Wars Mao Fought

Mao's theories and rise to power are set against a backdrop of decades of instability and conflict in China.

*   **Fall of the Qing Dynasty (1911):** China fractured into a multilateral civil war among warlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **First United Front (1923):** The Nationalist Party (KMT) and the Communist Party (CCP) formed an alliance to eliminate the warlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **The White Terror (c. 1927):** Chiang Kai-shek, leader of the KMT, turned on the Communists, massacring them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This led to a nominal unification of China under Nationalist rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Encirclement Campaigns:** Chiang launched five campaigns to eliminate Communist base areas (Soviets) in South China, primarily the Jiangxi Soviet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
*   **The Long March (Long Rout) (1934-1935):** The fifth encirclement campaign forced the Communists on a retreat to Yenan in the north, during which they lost 95% of their forces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Japanese Invasion:** Japan invaded Manchuria in 1931 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, creating a major crisis for Chiang Kai-shek. The Japanese continued their expansion, leading to the Xi'an Incident.
*   **Second United Front (1936):** The Nationalists and Communists formed a second uneasy alliance to fight the Japanese invasion following the Xi'an Incident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Japan escalated its offensive in 1937 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Nested Wars:** Mao understood he was fighting a civil war against the Nationalists within a regional war against Japan, which later became part of a global war after Pearl Harbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:32">[00:13:32]</a>.
*   **Communist Victory (1949):** After World War II, the civil war resumed, and Mao's Communists defeated the Nationalists, who had been significantly weakened by the war against Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.

## Mao's Rule and Its Impact

### Social Revolution and Mass Deaths
Upon winning the civil war, Mao imposed a "social revolution," which involved wiping out entire social classes, not just replacing the government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This often meant mass graves for targeted groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Statistics presented show a staggering number of Chinese civilian deaths during the Maoist period, exceeding all deaths in World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### The Great Leap Forward and Famine (1958-1962)
A significant portion of these deaths occurred during the Great Famine, described as the only nationwide famine in Chinese history caused by policy, not weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
Key policies during the Great Leap Forward included:
*   **Communes:** Peasants were forced onto communes, giving the Party control over the food supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Decentralized Industry:** Backyard furnaces were promoted, leading to a collapse in industrial production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Food Exports:** Despite collapsing agricultural production, Mao continued exporting food as a source of government income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
As a result, an estimated 40 million Chinese starved to death, primarily in rural areas, with peasant girls disproportionately affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This figure is based on the work of Yang Jisheng, author of *Tombstone* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

The presenter contrasts Mao as a "military genius" who reunified China with a "psychopath incapable of running an economy in peacetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The disastrous economic policies were attributed to Mao's primary objective of staying in power and maintaining party control, flawed communist ideology, a lack of peacetime economic expertise, and the difficulty of implementing central policies across a vast and shattered nation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. Purging those who offered counterarguments also contributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

### Reverence in China
Despite the catastrophic consequences of his rule, many Chinese, particularly Han Chinese, revere Mao as a national hero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This is attributed to his reunification of China and, in their view, ending the "era of humiliations" by fighting Western powers to a stalemate in the Korean War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Mao's Approach to Power: A Framework

The presenter analyzes Mao's leadership using Clausewitz's two indispensable qualities for a general: an intellect that finds truth even in darkness (coup d'oeil) and the courage to follow that light (determination) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This is applied across four areas:

### 1. Mao the Propagandist
Mao began his public service career as a propagandist [[mao_zedong_as_a_military_and_political_leader | Mao Zedong as a military and political leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Early Life:** Born in 1893 to a prosperous peasant family, he hated farming, tried various vocational schools, and eventually earned an education degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. He joined the Communist Party and, during the First United Front, also the Nationalist Party, where he learned the importance of propaganda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.
*   **Importance of Propaganda:** He believed the CCP could overthrow enemies "only by holding propaganda pamphlets in one hand and bullets in the other" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. Propaganda was a core department in the early Communist shadow government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Strategic Communication (Messenger, Message, Medium)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>:
    *   **Messengers:** These were the delivery system. Civil messengers (activists in local organizations) identified grievances and mobilized the population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>. Military units had large propaganda teams, considered a "first-priority work" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. Foreign journalists, like Edgar Snow (author of *Red Star Over China*), served as an international broadcasting system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>.
    *   **Message:** Mao advocated for simple, epigrammatic messages, using matching slogans like modern-day tweets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:22">[00:20:22]</a>. He was also a popular poet, writing simple couplets for the semi-literate and complex poetry (set to popular tunes) for intellectuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>.
    *   **Medium:** Mao used written/spoken word, dramatic arts, and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. He educated illiterate soldiers via political commissars and offered education to peasant children and adults for the first time, contrasting with the Nationalists who had to drop similar efforts due to fighting Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>. Professional military education also emphasized political work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:48">[00:23:48]</a>.

### 2. Mao the Social Scientist (Data Analyst)
Mao recognized the "peasant problem" as central to the national revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>.
*   **Data Collection:** Between 1926 and 1933, Mao conducted numerous data-driven surveys in the countryside, inventorying ownership and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **Analysis and Solution:** He found that 6% of the rural population owned 80% of the land, while 80% owned only 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:34">[00:25:34]</a>. His solution was revolution, mobilizing the 70% poor peasants and 20% middle peasants against the 10% "exploitative" class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>.
*   **Land Investigation Movement:** This "violent and ruthless" process determined class status, leading to land confiscation and redistribution to invert the social pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Class status approval was a "life-and-death decision" involving local votes and party approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Strategic Land Reform:** Land reform was crucial for peasant allegiance [[the_effects_of_agriculture_on_human_genetics_and_societal_development | The effects of agriculture on human genetics and societal development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>. Mao gave peasants land, knowing they desperately wanted it, to gain their support, even though his ultimate goal was collectivization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:58">[00:27:58]</a>. He temporarily kept rich peasants for their production and used a "bait and switch" for middle peasants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:23">[00:28:23]</a>.
*   **"Red Terror":** Achieving land reform required "terror in rural areas," involving shooting landlords, a policy unacceptable to the Nationalists whose officers were often landlords <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:47">[00:28:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.

### 3. Mao the Military Leader
Mao famously stated, "Political power grows out of the barrel of a gun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:34">[00:29:34]</a>.
*   **Vindication of Early Views:** Mao's military strategies were often minority views within the CCP but were eventually vindicated by events [[maos_strategies_and_theories_of_warfare | Mao's strategies and theories of warfare]].
    *   Critics like Li Lisan failed by attempting decisive urban battles too early (Nanchang 1927, Changsha 1930) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>.
    *   Xiang Ying, sent to fire Mao, adopted a strategy of defending territory that led to the Long March disaster, proving Mao's strategy of luring the enemy deep correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>.
    *   Zhang Guotao's preference for Han lands over Mao's choice of Yenan (near the Soviet border) for retreat led to defeats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a>.
*   **Definition of War:** Mao saw war as "politics by other means" but added the dimension of class overthrow: "A revolution is an uprising, an act of violence whereby one class overthrows the power of another" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.
*   **Strategy for Defeating Japan:** Mao identified three conditions: progress by China (winning the civil war), difficulties for Japan (the regional war), and international support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>.
*   **Key Military Concepts:**
    *   **Base Areas (Soviets):** Located in difficult terrain on provincial boundaries with strong Red Army presence, local support, and good party organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>.
    *   **Triangle Building:** Guerrilla detachments operating in the interface between base areas and enemy territory, potentially forming new base areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:57">[00:36:57]</a>.
    *   **Guerrilla vs. Conventional Forces:** Mao saw these as his two military services. Guerrillas operated in the enemy rear, but regular forces were "of primary importance" for achieving a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:51">[00:37:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:32">[00:38:32]</a>.
    *   **Cultivating Allies:** Peasants (through land reform, education, army discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>), women (offering equality, voting rights, participation in government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:49">[00:39:49]</a>), minorities (offering self-determination, later revoked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:40:54]</a>), youth, intellectuals, and even the enemy army.
    *   **Disintegrating the Enemy Army:** Infiltrating enemy ranks with workers and peasants and practicing leniency with POWs to highlight Communist benevolence versus Nationalist brutality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:25">[00:41:25]</a>.
    *   **Protracted Warfare:** Based on China's size, undeveloped status, a strong enemy (Japan), a weak Red Army, and an ongoing agrarian revolution, Mao concluded victory was possible but would take time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>. He leveraged Japanese weaknesses like inadequate manpower and brutality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>.
    *   **Three Stages of People's War:** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>
        1.  *Strategic Defensive:* Popular mobilization, base/triangle building, guerrilla warfare.
        2.  *Strategic Stalemate:* Mobile warfare, initial conventional warfare, diplomacy. Transition is dangerous as the insurgency is now recognized.
        3.  *Strategic Offensive:* Positional warfare, decisive battles. Requires a "big friend" (like the Soviet Union) for conventional armaments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Civil War:** The presenter notes that while Mao claimed these stages applied to the war with Japan, they more accurately described the civil war. The Nationalists did most of the conventional fighting against Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. Mao's one major campaign against Japan (Hundred Regiments, 1940) resulted in severe Japanese retaliation ("three alls" campaign) and was not repeated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

### 4. Mao the Grand Strategist
Mao integrated all elements of national power available to him [[grand_strategy_and_national_power_coordination | Grand Strategy and National Power Coordination]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.
*   **Instruments of Power:** Peasantry, propaganda, land reform, base areas, institution building, warfare, and diplomacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:08">[00:49:08]</a>. This differed from the US DIME (Diplomacy, Intelligence, Military, Economics) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:25">[00:49:25]</a>.
*   **Sinification of Marxism:** Mao adapted Marxism to Chinese conditions, making it more appealing to other agricultural, decolonizing nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>.
*   **Prescience:** He demonstrated foresight regarding the peasantry, women, military strategy, and the trajectory of the war with Japan and US involvement [[impact_of_oil_on_historical_and_modern_geopolitics | Impact of oil on historical and modern geopolitics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.

## Mao's Enduring Concepts for Insurgency

Mao developed several concepts useful for insurgents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:01">[00:51:01]</a>:
*   **Rural Mobilization:** Successfully used in China and by North Vietnam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:20">[00:51:20]</a>.
*   **Base Areas:** Crucial for Mao and North Vietnam; the presenter notes "Al Qaeda" means "the base" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.
*   **Luring the Enemy Deep:** Used successfully against Nationalists in encirclement campaigns and Manchuria, and against MacArthur in Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>.
*   **Terminal Point of Retreat:** Yenan was a successful example for Mao <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Disintegrating Enemy Forces:** Seen with the Nationalists, South Vietnamese, and even Japan in WWII <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.
*   **Three Stages of People's War:** Can be viewed as a metric for an insurgency's progress and setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:39">[00:56:39]</a>.

## Mao's Thinking: Dualities

Mao's writings are characterized by dualities, possibly influenced by Yin and Yang concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:34">[00:57:34]</a>. He often discussed strategy in terms of opposites: presence/absence, defend/attack, retreat/advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:55">[00:57:55]</a>. Brigadier General Samuel B. Griffith's translation of Sun Tzu highlights the wisdom of finding advantage in apparent disadvantage, a skill Mao possessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:35">[01:00:35]</a>. However, the presenter notes that in peacetime, choices are graduated, and evolution is more conducive to economic development than revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>.

## Conclusion

Mao Zedong remains a deeply polarizing figure. He was a master military theorist and practitioner of insurgency who reunified a fractured China, ending a perceived era of humiliation. However, his rule led to catastrophic social and economic policies, resulting in the deaths of tens of millions of his own people [[the_impact_of_mao_zedongs_policies_on_chinese_society | The impact of Mao Zedong's policies on Chinese society]]. His theories on revolution and guerrilla warfare continue to be studied and have influenced movements worldwide, while his domestic policies serve as a stark warning about the dangers of unchecked power and ideological rigidity.

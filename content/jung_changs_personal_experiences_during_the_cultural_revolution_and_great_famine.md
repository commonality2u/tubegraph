Jung Chang (born in Sichuan, 1952 [00:01:38]) is a Chinese-born British writer whose works, notably *Wild Swans*, detail the harrowing experiences of her family and herself during [[mao_zedong_as_a_military_and_political_leader | Mao Zedong's rule in China]]. This article outlines her personal recollections of the [[the_great_leap_forward_and_the_cultural_revolution | Cultural Revolution and the Great Famine]], as described in a podcast episode.

## Early Life and Family Background

Chang described a privileged childhood as the daughter of Communist officials [00:01:44]. Her family lived in a compound with amenities such as servants, cars, and drivers, leading her to take class and privilege for granted [00:01:51]-[00:02:07].

## The Cultural Revolution (1966 onwards)

The Cultural Revolution, launched by Mao in 1966 when Chang was 14 [00:02:23], brought profound suffering to her family and dramatically altered her life.

### Impact on her Father
Her father, a Communist official, spoke up against Mao's policies [00:00:00], [00:02:30]. As a result, he was arrested, tortured, driven insane, exiled to a camp, and died prematurely [00:00:04]-[00:00:08], [00:02:39]-[00:02:47]. He had attempted to voice his dissent through official channels by writing a letter to Mao, a theoretically permitted act for a party member [00:16:16], [00:17:43]-[00:17:55].

### Impact on her Mother
Chang's mother faced immense pressure to denounce her husband but refused [00:00:08]-[00:00:14], [00:02:51]-[00:02:53]. Consequently, she endured over 100 "denunciation meetings," common at the time, where victims were physically abused on stage (arms twisted, heads pushed down, kicked, beaten) [00:02:57]-[00:03:20]. She was once made to kneel on broken glass [00:00:14], [00:03:23] and was paraded through the streets while children spat and threw stones at her [00:00:17]-[00:00:22], [00:03:26]-[00:03:31]. She survived and, at the time of the podcast, was 92 and living in Chengdu [00:03:34]-[00:03:40].

### Jung Chang's Own Experiences
With her family scattered [00:03:40], Chang herself was exiled to the edge of the Himalayas [00:03:45]. During these years, she worked variously as:
*   A peasant [00:00:30], [00:03:48]
*   A "barefoot doctor," a term for a doctor with no training [00:00:33], [00:03:52]. This was a consequence of Mao's dictum, "the more books you read, the more stupid you become" [00:03:58]-[00:04:01].
*   An electrician, also without training, during which time she received five electric shocks in one month [00:00:35], [00:04:24]-[00:04:30].

China became a "cultural desert" for ten years, with schools closed, books burned, and no cinemas or theaters [00:04:05]-[00:04:19]. Chang saw her secondary school teachers being abused, beaten, and driven to suicide [00:32:48]-[00:33:02].

Despite the impossibility of being a writer [00:08:12], Chang harbored this desire. At 16 (in 1968, not 1978 as misspoken in the transcript [00:08:35]-[00:08:40]), she wrote her first poem. When Red Guards raided their flat, she had to flush it down the toilet to avoid trouble [00:08:44]-[00:09:02]. Throughout her various labors, she was "always writing in my head with an imaginary pen" [00:00:35]-[00:00:38], [00:09:10]-[00:09:41].

### Psychological Impact and Developing Doubts
Chang described the intense brainwashing and indoctrination, where Mao was presented as god-like; children would say "I swear to Chairman Mao" to affirm truth [00:11:24]-[00:11:45]. Questioning Mao was extremely dangerous [00:11:56]-[00:12:00]. Her first doubts about the society arose on her 16th birthday (the poem incident). With her parents detained and her grandmother weeping over her mother's mistreatment, she thought, "If this is Paradise, what then is hell?" [00:12:27]-[00:13:07]. However, Mao himself remained "beyond questioning" [00:13:15]. It took eight years, until 1976 when she saw a Newsweek article captioning "Madame Mao is Mao's eyes, ears, and mouth," for her to realize Mao's direct responsibility for the atrocities [00:15:08]-[00:15:55].

## The Great Famine (Observations during the Great Leap Forward)

While Chang's family was privileged and she did not personally starve during the [[the_impact_of_mao_zedongs_policies_on_chinese_society | Great Famine]] [00:34:52]-[00:35:00], she witnessed its devastating effects.

### Witnessing Starvation
*   At age 8 or 9, a boy snatched a steamed bread from her mouth and ate it [00:35:08]-[00:35:36]. Her father sadly told her, "you are very lucky, you know other children are starving" [00:35:40]-[00:35:53].
*   Their domestic help, from a "landlord" class family, lost her entire family to starvation [00:35:57]-[00:36:02]. Chang recalled the maid weeping so profusely that frogs in their courtyard seemed to leap in her tears [00:36:31]-[00:36:44].
*   Her grandmother commented, "The Communists are good except all these people are dead," a statement that scared Chang due to its contradiction with official indoctrination [00:36:59]-[00:37:14].
*   The maid's mother, already like a skeleton, visited to report family deaths and thank Chang's mother for saving her daughter; she died soon after returning home [00:37:26]-[00:38:13].
*   Her father, feeling guilty, volunteered to stay in a village. He witnessed horrific scenes, including a man unsteadily walking on paddy field ridges and suddenly dropping dead [00:38:16]-[00:38:55]. He returned famished and suffering from "animals" (likely edema) [00:39:02]-[00:39:15].

### Desperate Measures and Absurd Campaigns
*   Her family, including the children, drank a concoction made from a "little seed that fed on urine" (possibly Chlorella) for nutrition, which tasted revolting [00:39:20]-[00:39:54]. The adults in her family often went hungry to ensure the children had food [00:39:58]-[00:40:15].
*   **Sparrow Extermination:** As a child, she participated in the campaign to kill sparrows by beating saucepans to make them drop from exhaustion [01:13:39]-[01:14:13].
*   **Backyard Furnaces:** At age six, her main occupation in primary school was to collect small pieces of metal like nails and cogs for the backyard furnace at her school [01:11:36]-[01:11:59]. Mountains were denuded of trees for fuel [01:12:32]-[01:12:43], and she and other children would babysit for their exhausted teachers [01:12:46]-[01:12:52].

## Path to Writing
After Mao's death in 1976 [00:06:31], China began to change. In 1978, Chang was among the first 14 people selected through a national exam to study in Britain [[cultural_transmission_knowledge_accumulation_and_social_learning | leading to cultural exchanges and greater understanding between nations]] [00:06:37]-[00:07:00], becoming the first person from Sichuan Province to study in the West [00:07:04]-[00:07:14]. She earned a doctorate in Linguistics from the University of York in 1982 [00:07:18]-[00:07:26]. For ten years in Britain, she avoided thinking about the painful past [00:07:39]-[00:07:46]. It was only after her mother's visit in 1988, during which her mother shared stories of her life and her grandmother's life, that Chang felt compelled to write them down, leading to the creation of *Wild Swans* [00:09:48]-[00:10:28].

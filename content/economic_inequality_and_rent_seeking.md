Here is the modified article:

Georgism, an economic philosophy originating from the 19th-century American economist Henry George, posits that economic inequality and detrimental forms of rent-seeking are fundamentally linked to the private ownership and speculative control of land and other natural monopolies. [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | This article]], based on a podcast discussion with Lars Doucet, author of "Land is a Big Deal," explores these concepts.

## The Core Problem: Progress and Poverty

Henry George's seminal work, "Progress and Poverty," sought to explain a central paradox: why does poverty seem to advance even as technological and societal progress advances? Despite immense increases in productive capacity, significant inequality persists. Georgism argues that the answer lies in how the benefits of progress are captured, primarily through the rising value of land. [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | Georgism proposes]] a "third way" that is genuinely pro-worker and pro-business but is staunchly against land speculation and unproductive rent-seeking.

## Land as a Unique Economic Factor

Georgism emphasizes that "land is a big deal." Unlike capital or labor, land (in its natural state) is not produced by human effort; it pre-exists human society. Its value is derived from its location and the surrounding community, including public infrastructure and private enterprise – factors often summarized by the real estate adage "location, location, location."

### Ricardo's Law of Rent

The value of land tends to absorb the economic gains from societal progress. This is explained by Ricardo's Law of Rent, which states that as population and productivity increase, the demand for well-located land rises. Tenants and businesses compete for these desirable locations, bidding up rents. The landowner, by virtue of simply controlling access to this scarce resource, captures this socially created value. The rent charged can rise up to the "margin of production," which is the value that could be obtained from the best available free alternative.

## Rent Seeking and Its Manifestations

Rent-seeking, in this context, refers to efforts to increase one's share of existing wealth without creating new wealth. Land ownership, particularly speculative landholding, is presented as a prime example.

### Land Speculation
Land speculators acquire land not necessarily to use it productively, but to profit from its anticipated increase in value as the surrounding community develops. This allows a class of people to gatekeep access to a necessary resource, charging others for the privilege of using it without contributing to its value. This can lead to phenomena like "land banking," where valuable land is kept vacant or underutilized while waiting for its price to "ripen."

### Examples of Rent Dynamics
*   **Virtual Housing Crises:** Doucet notes the recurrence of "virtual housing crises" in online multiplayer games like Ultima Online and Final Fantasy XIV, and even in crypto-based "metaverse" platforms. Despite the potential for theoretically infinite "land," scarcity and desirable locations lead to speculation and unaffordable virtual housing, mirroring real-world issues. [[game_development_and_virtual_land_speculation | This trend]] is reflective of both digital and physical realms.
*   **The American Frontier:** The historical American frontier offered an escape valve, allowing access to "free" land. The closing of this frontier, followed by a new "frontier" opened by the automobile (suburbanization), eventually saw the benefits priced into land values. More recently, the shift to remote work (e.g., via Zoom) created a minor, quickly "closed" frontier, with increased demand for suburban/rural housing leading to price increases.

## The Georgist Solution: Land Value Tax (LVT)

The primary policy prescription of Georgism is the **Land Value Tax (LVT)**. This is a tax on the unimproved value of land only, excluding any buildings, infrastructure, or other human-made improvements on the land.

### Moral and Economic Rationale
*   **Taxing Unearned Income:** The LVT aims to capture for public use the economic rent of land – value that arises from the community and nature, not from the individual landowner's efforts. 
*   **Incentivizing Productive Use:** By taxing only the land's value, LVT discourages holding land vacant or underdeveloped for speculative purposes, as the tax burden would be the same regardless of improvements. Conversely, it does not penalize improvements (like buildings), encouraging development.
*   **Reducing Other Taxes:** Revenue from LVT could be used to reduce or eliminate taxes on productive activities like income, sales, and capital gains, [[tax_reform_and_income_inequality | which are seen]] as discouraging work and investment. 

## Addressing Criticisms and Nuances

### The Search-Theoretic Critique
One critique (from Zachary Gauthier and Bryan Caplan) argues that identifying valuable land (e.g., finding oil) is itself a productive activity deserving reward. Doucet responds that an LVT need not be 100% (e.g., 85% could still allow for discovery incentives) and that discovery costs can be directly subsidized, as in Norway's petroleum model, separating the reward for discovery from the capture of the resource's inherent rent.

### Impact on Homeowners and the Banking Sector
A rapid, full implementation of LVT could significantly decrease land selling prices, potentially impacting homeowners who bought at high values and the banking sector reliant on real estate collateral. The proposed transition is incremental, [[political_feasibility_of_land_value_tax | perhaps starting]] with a revenue-neutral shift from existing property taxes (exempting buildings) and potentially coupled with a citizen's dividend to mitigate negative impacts.

### Calculation of Land Value
Separating the value of land from the value of improvements is a technical challenge. Doucet's startup, GeoLand Solutions, aims to improve mass appraisal techniques using methods like multiple regression and geographic weighted regression to provide more accurate assessments.

## Broader Applications of Georgist Principles

The concept of taxing economic rent from scarce, non-produced assets extends beyond physical land:

*   **Land-Like Assets:** These include resources that are scarce, necessary for production, and derive locational value. Examples cited include domain names, app store chart positions, orbital real estate, and radio spectrum. 
*   **Severance Taxes:** Taxes on the extraction of natural resources (e.g., oil, minerals, water) [[economic_and_strategic_implications_of_energy_resources | are consistent with]] Georgist principles, capturing the value of the resource itself for public benefit. Norway's successful oil fund is an example.
*   **Intellectual Property:** Extremely long copyright and patent terms can lead to rent-seeking, stifling innovation by enclosing ideas that should eventually enter the public commons. Shorter terms are suggested. 
*   **Georgism in Space:** The Outer Space Treaty already reflects some Georgist ideas by prohibiting national appropriation of celestial bodies. Applying Georgist principles to space settlement [[scientific_and_technological_developments_in_ai | could prevent]] rent-seeking and encourage equitable development.

## Political Feasibility

Implementing LVT is seen as more politically feasible than often assumed, particularly if framed as property tax reform. A "split-rate" property tax, where buildings are taxed at zero or a very low rate and land at a higher rate to maintain revenue neutrality, is a potential pathway. [[political_feasibility_of_land_value_tax | Such proposals]] are being discussed in cities like Detroit. 

The core idea is that rents will be collected one way or another; Georgism argues [[georgism_and_land_value_tax | they should be collected]] on behalf of the community that creates the value, rather than by private actors who may hold valuable land out of use.

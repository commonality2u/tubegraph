Stripe is a technology company that builds economic infrastructure for the internet. It is often cited as a key player in the evolution of payment systems, but what distinguishes it in a world filled with financial technology companies? CEO Patrick Collison shares insights into the company’s growth and its future trajectory.

## Origins and Market Inefficiency

Stripe was founded in 2010, at a time when the global economy was still recovering from the 2008 financial crisis. The company's emergence aligned with the rise of app stores, the on-demand economy, and a startup boom post-Y Combinator and the financial crisis. Patrick attributes much of Stripe's opportunity to market inefficiency, pointing out the peculiarity that so many payments solutions in the market, even those by technology companies in San Francisco, hadn’t achieved what Stripe set out to do. The inefficiency was notable enough that Stripe could carve out a significant niche by addressing it effectively [[the_influence_of_private_markets_and_venture_capital_on_economic_bubbles]].

## Complementary and Expanding Services

Stripe’s initial product, a payments API, was crafted to simplify and improve online financial transactions. However, the company has expanded far beyond this core service, entering into adjacent sectors such as identity verification, fraud detection, and tools like Stripe Atlas, which helps entrepreneurs incorporate businesses easily [[automation_in_companies]].

The idea behind these complementary services is that once Stripe manages the primary thread of revenue management — that is, orchestrating everything pertaining to revenue — many other business functions that tie back to this core also become relevant. This broad ecosystem approach is one major factor contributing to Stripe's influence and growth [[ai_in_business_and_consumer_applications]].

## Global Expansion and Impact

Stripe now processes a significant portion of the internet's transactions, handling around 1% of global GDP. As it expands its services globally, Stripe's potential impact increases, particularly in underserved markets where the infrastructure for digital payments is minimal [[ai_and_economic_growth]].

Patrick Collison discusses how even as Stripe grows, it aims to expand not only its market share but also the size of the market itself, thus helping to grow the GDP of the internet. This mission goes beyond simply migrating existing economic activity to their platform, aiming instead to stimulate new economic activities that weren't previously feasible [[economic_impact_of_ai_and_automation_on_global_growth]].

## A Platform Approach

Stripe takes a platform approach, aiming to connect with existing financial systems rather than supplant them. This strategy is a deliberate choice to leverage classical network effects as described by Metcalfe's Law, which suggests that the value of a telecommunications network is proportional to the square of the number of connected users of the system [[potential_risks_and_benefits_of_ai_in_society]]. By enhancing these existing ecosystems, Stripe maximizes value creation both for itself and its users.

## Conclusion

Stripe is a stellar example of how innovation within the financial technology space can arise not just from creating something entirely new, but from enhancing what already exists to better meet the needs of the market. As payment systems continue to evolve, Stripe’s influence and foundational role in the digital economy showcase its remarkable journey and ongoing potential in scaling global transactions and business growth [[development_and_deployment_of_ai_systems]].

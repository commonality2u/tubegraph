During the COVID-19 pandemic, the challenge of efficiently distributing vaccines highlighted significant gaps in public sector capabilities. While volunteer initiatives like VaccinateCA stepped in to address some of these gaps [[vaccinateca_initiative_and_vaccine_distribution_issues_during_covid19 | [00:00:49]]], the question arose: why didn't established Big Tech companies, with their vast resources and technical expertise, play a more prominent role in solving such critical logistical and informational problems? Patrick McKenzie, who became the CEO of VaccinateCA, shed light on the complex factors that limited Big Tech's involvement.

## The Problem: A Vacuum in Public Health Response

In early 2021, individuals faced immense difficulty in finding COVID-19 vaccine appointments, often making dozens of phone calls to pharmacies. There was a clear need for a centralized system to track vaccine availability, a task seemingly well-suited for a technologically advanced nation [[the_evolution_and_future_of_the_tech_industry | [00:01:05]]]. However, government entities at various levels failed to produce such a system effectively. The federal government, scarred by the problematic rollout of Healthcare.gov, had institutionally learned to avoid taking ownership of large-scale software projects, fearing political fallout from technical failures [[institutional_failures_in_us_public_health_and_logistics | [00:02:25]]].

## Why Big Tech Hesitated to Intervene

Despite the apparent need and their capabilities, major tech companies (referred to by McKenzie as "AppAmaGooFaSoft" or "AppAmaGooBookSoft") were largely absent from developing public-facing solutions for vaccine availability.

### Political Climate and Perceived Risks
A significant factor was the political climate, particularly following the January 6th events in the United States [[impact_of_technological_change_on_politics | [00:09:56]]].
*   **"Don't Get in the Newspaper":** Tech companies faced pressure and accusations of contributing to political polarization. Their internal policy, PR, and communications teams strongly advised keeping a low profile to avoid negative press [[media_influence_on_politics | [00:10:17]]].
*   **Fear of Outshining the Government:** There was a sentiment within tech companies that demonstrating superior competence to the government in a crisis could be politically detrimental. Public health teams within these large tech organizations, who might have proposed solutions, were potentially overruled due to fears that "the tech industry saying we're better at the government's job than the government is" would be poorly received [[challenges_of_political_leadership_and_governance | [00:10:41]]]. McKenzie noted the reprehensible reality that these companies likely correctly assessed this political risk.

### The Copenhagen Principle of Culpability
McKenzie referenced the "Copenhagen Principle of Culpability". This principle suggests that if an entity (like a tech company) steps in to solve a part of a problem, it implicitly takes on responsibility and potential blame for the *entirety* of the problem and its associated consequences [[the_role_of_deep_learning_and_discrete_program_search_in_ai_development | [00:12:19]]].
*   Tech companies feared that by building a vaccine locator, they would be held accountable for all failings of the vaccination effort, including issues like equitable distribution or supply chain bottlenecks, even if those were outside their control. The act of "touching the problem" would transfer liability for sins of omission and commission, and embarrass a government that would hold it against them [[the_impact_of_modern_technology_on_warfare_and_strategy | [00:12:33]]].

### Past Controversies
The shadow of past controversies, like Cambridge Analytica, also played a role. The narrative that a small tech-affiliated team could "root" a U.S. presidential election, though disputed by McKenzie, led to aggressive attempts to "clip the wings of tech" [[impact_of_ai_on_software_development_and_productivity | [00:13:52]]]. This likely made tech companies wary of any action that could attract similar scrutiny.

## Internal Dynamics and Decision-Making

Even when some within tech companies recognized the need, internal processes could be slow. McKenzie's fundraising efforts for VaccinateCA encountered tech company bureaucracies where a desire to help was slowed by internal processes, sometimes taking weeks to approve relatively small sums of money [[entrepreneurial_challenges_and_venture_capital_dynamics | [00:41:03]]]. By the time approvals came, the perceived urgency had diminished for some funders.

## The "Colonel" Model: A Proposed Alternative

McKenzie suggested a historical model where the U.S. government, lacking specific state capacity, would identify experts in civil society or private industry and effectively deputize them, giving them authority and resources (e.g., "you're now a colonel in the United States army") [[historical_influences_on_leadership_and_innovation | [00:27:15]]]. This approach could have been used to commission tech leaders to solve data and logistics problems rapidly [[government_and_policy_coordination_on_ai_risks | [00:27:43]]].

## Tech as a "Cat's Paw": Government Influence and Co-option

A contrasting concern is the government using tech companies to achieve policy ends that it cannot or will not pursue directly. McKenzie highlighted the *Missouri v. Biden* court case, which alleged that U.S. government actors "puppeteered" tech companies to censor speech, violating constitutionally protected freedoms [[geopolitical_implications_on_technology_and_data_centers | [01:14:16]]].

## Future Role and Responsibilities

McKenzie argued for a shift in how both government and Big Tech approach these situations:

*   **Tech Engagement:** The tech industry needs to become more skilled at interfacing with government and cannot afford to "sit out" during crises. This includes being strategic about criticism while still advocating for effective solutions [[challenges_and_important_in_political_leadership_and_governance | [00:51:58]]].
*   **Government Perspective:** The government should view its domestic tech industry as a capable asset rather than an adversary and improve its own competence in software [[economic_growth_and_technological_acceleration | [00:53:30]]].
*   **"Intestinal Fortitude":** Tech companies may need to demonstrate greater "intestinal fortitude". When faced with improper pressure to censor speech or avoid "embarrassing" the government, they might need to publicly disclose such requests [[ai_alignment_and_safety_research | [01:22:10]]].

## Conclusion

The experience surrounding the COVID-19 vaccine rollout and the limited direct involvement of Big Tech reveal a complex interplay of political pressures, risk aversion, internal corporate dynamics, and the evolving relationship between major technology platforms and government. While tech companies possess immense potential to assist in public crises, their willingness and ability to do so are constrained by a web of incentives and perceived threats. Moving forward, a more effective crisis response may require both government entities to better leverage tech capabilities and for tech companies to navigate political landscapes with a greater willingness to engage and, when necessary, resist undue influence [[impact_of_ai_on_future_technology_and_society]].

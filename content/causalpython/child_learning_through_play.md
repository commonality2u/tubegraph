When observing a child holding a block or toy, it's common to see them throw it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. While some [[parent_reactions_to_childrens_behaviors | parents might interpret]] this as aggressive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, most of the time, children throw things to learn how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This active engagement is a key way children learn, and it differentiates [[comparison_between_child_learning_and_machine_learning | Children's Learning]] from how most [[developing_effective_machine_learning_models | machine learning systems]] operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Active Experimentation in Children

Children don't just passively observe; they perform systematic experiments to understand the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Alison Gopnik, an American [[developmental_psychology_studies_on_infants | developmental psychologist]], has shown that children conduct these experiments to learn the laws of physics and rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

Research by Amy St. John and Lisa Fenson from Johns Hopkins University highlights this experimental drive in infants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Their studies reveal that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects that display unpredictable properties, such as toys that can pass through walls, rather than playing with more predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Benefits of Interactive Learning

The ability of infants to interact with the world actively offers several advantages:
*   It makes their learning more robust compared to merely observing the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   It informs them which hypotheses to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

This interactive process creates a continuous chain of hypothesis and tests, aimed at falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This entire approach provides children with a powerful toolkit for building effective world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This capability fundamentally differentiates infants and children from most contemporary [[developing_effective_machine_learning_models | machine learning systems]], which typically learn in a more [[active_learning_versus_static_learning | static way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

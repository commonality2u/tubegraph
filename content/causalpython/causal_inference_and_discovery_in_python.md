From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 

A book on [[Causal inference and machine learning | causal inference]] and [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] focuses on practical application using Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This resource aims to help individuals apply these methods effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Practical Application through a Book

The book's explanations are designed to be intuitive, allowing readers to grasp complex concepts more easily than with other materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It is currently the only book on the market that covers both [[Causal inference and machine learning | causal inference]] and [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]], while also addressing causality in the context of deep learning and large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This unique combination of topics, especially with an emphasis on Python, distinguishes it from other available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Key Learnings

From the perspective of applying [[Causal inference and machine learning | causal inference]] and [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]], three key learnings are highlighted:

### Data Alone is Not Enough
Data by itself is often insufficient to answer many interesting questions in both business and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This is particularly true for questions about "what if" scenarios, or how the world would change if specific actions were taken, which differs from mere static prediction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Importance of Process
A systematic approach is crucial for achieving good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Understanding the process and what is being done is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Traces in Data Generating Process
The process by which data is generated often leaves detectable traces within the data itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. While raw data isn't always sufficient, treating data analysis like detective work—seeking out these partial traces and combining them with expert knowledge and realistic assumptions—can lead to insightful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

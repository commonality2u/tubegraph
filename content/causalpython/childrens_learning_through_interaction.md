Children often engage in behaviors that, to an adult, might seem negative or aggressive, such as throwing a toy or block across the room <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While [[parents_perceptions_of_childrens_behaviors | parents perceptions of children's behaviors]] might sometimes interpret these actions as aggression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, in most cases, children throw things because it is a crucial part of their [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | learning]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These actions help them understand how the physical world operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## Active Experimentation

This active, exploratory approach is a key distinction between [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | children's learning]] and how most [[differences_between_children_and_machine_learning_systems | machine learning systems]] acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

*   **Systematic Experiments**: American [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | developmental psychologist]] Alison Gopnik has shown that [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | children]] conduct systematic experiments. These experiments enable them to learn the laws of physics and the rules governing social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Preference for Unpredictability**: [[research_on_infant_experimentation | Research on infant experimentation]] by Amy S. and Lisa Feigenson from Johns Hopkins University revealed that infants as young as 11 months old prefer to experiment with objects that display unpredictable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For instance, they prefer playing with toys that can seemingly pass through walls rather than those with predictable behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Benefits of Interactive Learning

The ability of infants to interact directly with their environment provides several advantages for their [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | learning]]:

*   **Robust Learning**: This interaction makes their learning more robust compared to simply observing the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis Testing**: It also guides them in determining which hypothesis to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This creates an interactive chain of forming hypotheses and then testing them to prove or disprove their validity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Collectively, this active and interactive approach provides [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | children]] with a powerful toolkit for building effective models of the world around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This capability fundamentally differentiates infants and, later, [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | children]] from most contemporary [[differences_between_children_and_machine_learning_systems | machine learning systems]], which typically learn in a more static manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

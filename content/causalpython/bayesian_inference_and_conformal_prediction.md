## Bayesian Inference

Andrew Lawrence's PhD research from the University of Bath focused on [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian non-parametrics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:37">[01:05:37]</a>. This foundation provided a strong basis for quickly understanding causal topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

### Applicability to Causality
Bayesian non-parametrics, particularly with generative modeling using Gaussian processes and Dirichlet processes, helped in understanding how to factorize joint distributions correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. This involves learning a latent variable model for high-dimensional data, factorizing it into a latent space, and making distributional assumptions about that space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>. This approach is applicable to [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian networks]] as it focuses on capturing the true data generating process, where a variable Y is a function of X, leading to factorization in the way data is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. This involves thinking about the direction of influence or information flow between variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

At Causal Lens, a Pyro engine is utilized to perform distributional inference on nodes within their structural causal models, enabling stochastic variational inference to estimate the posterior at a node <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:20">[01:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Conformal Prediction

Conformal prediction is a popular framework for [[integration_of_uncertainty_estimation_in_data_science | uncertainty quantification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00">[01:35:00]</a>. Recent literature indicates that conformal prediction can be successfully merged with causal methods to improve [[integration_of_uncertainty_estimation_in_data_science | uncertainty quantification]] and yield valid intervals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

### Applications and Limitations
Causal Lens uses Mappy, an open-source library for conformal prediction, integrated into their causal impact package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This package, which focuses on time series analysis, utilizes various methods including quantile regression, bootstrapping, and conformal prediction for [[integration_of_uncertainty_estimation_in_data_science | uncertainty estimation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

When comparing conformal prediction to other [[integration_of_uncertainty_estimation_in_data_science | uncertainty quantification]] methods, it's difficult to definitively state a visible improvement in the time series domain where it's been applied, as the original implementation typically focuses on independent and identically distributed (IID) data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. While there is recent work on conformal prediction for non-stationary time series, it hasn't been explored sufficiently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. The speed of conformal prediction is noted as good, but its accuracy in the time series context is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.

Preserving temporal information in data analysis is crucial for deriving accurate and unbiased insights, particularly in causal inference. When data is collapsed or summarized without accounting for time, it can lead to significant issues, including data loss, biased results, and misidentification of causal relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Challenges of Collapsing Data

Many real-world scenarios involve time-varying treatments, outcomes, and confounders, such as feature adoption, user conversions, and in-app activity in product analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. One of the main challenges is simply organizing such data in a straightforward manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.

When temporal relationships are ignored, common pitfalls include:

*   **Incorrect Causal Ordering** For an event (like a feature adoption) to affect an outcome (like conversion), the event must logically precede the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. If data is simply categorized (e.g., "first-day adoptions" vs. "conversions after the first day"), it often leads to discarding significant portions of the dataset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. This discarding is not merely a reduction in data quantity but introduces a strong bias, as it disproportionately removes cases where the treatment had an immediate and strong effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:47">[00:20:47]</a>. For example, if a feature is very effective, conversion might happen right after its adoption, potentially causing both events to fall within the same initial time frame (e.g., the first day). If such cases are discarded for failing to meet a strict "event-before-outcome" window, the feature's true positive impact can be underestimated, leading to a biased and incorrect conclusion that the feature is not very good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.
*   **Loss of Temporal Relation between Confounders and Treatment** Collapsing data can also obscure the temporal relationship between confounders and the treatment itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:38]</a>. Features that were interacted with *because* of a treatment might incorrectly be treated as confounders that *preceded* the treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:44]</a>. Squashing the time dimension introduces "backwards relationships" that can significantly bias analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:10]</a>. If one controls for actions that are a *result* of adopting a feature, it's equivalent to controlling for a mediator, which can bias the effect estimate downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:06]</a>. This means the overall impact of the treatment, including its mediated effects, is not captured, which is often what decision-makers are most interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:18]</a>.

## Solutions through Time-Dimension Preservation

To overcome these challenges, methods that explicitly preserve the time dimension are invaluable.

*   **[[survival_analysis_as_a_method_in_causal_inference | Survival Analysis]] and Time-Varying Covariates**
    [[survival_analysis_as_a_method_in_causal_inference | Survival analysis]], though perhaps underrated and less known outside the statistics community, is a powerful third branch of supervised learning (alongside classification and regression) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:02">[00:21:05]</a>. It allows for the use of time-varying covariates to encode instances where users adopted a feature but haven't converted yet, or instances where they haven't adopted it at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:43">[00:21:45]</a>. This approach enables the comparison of groups on an "equal footing" regarding the time they had to convert, without discarding any valuable information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:15]</a>.
    This methodology can also be used to model behavioral confounders. For example, feature adoption can be treated as a censored time-to-event target, similar to conversion, with in-app usages acting as covariates. This helps identify user profiles that quickly adopt features versus those that take longer or never adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

By preserving the [[time_scale_and_its_importance_in_causal_models | time dimension]] and encoding it directly into the data structure, one can achieve millisecond-precise descriptions of user journeys and ensure that treatments and confounders always precede the outcomes they are intended to affect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:24]</a>. This natural preservation of the time dimension helps overcome biases related to mediators or blockers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:30">[00:28:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Limitations and Practical Application

While preserving the time dimension resolves many common biases, it's important to note that the time criterion alone is not always sufficient to exclude all spurious relations, particularly in the presence of hidden confounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:29:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:22]</a>. However, in scenarios where hidden confounders are assumed away, sorting by time can resolve most issues related to incorrect conditioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:35]</a>.

Ultimately, correctly accounting for temporal information is paramount for driving better decision-making and helping businesses thrive. Removing the time dimension without proper consideration can actually harm the business rather than help it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

Dr. Thomas Wiecki, creator of one of the most recognizable Python [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | probabilistic programming frameworks]], PyMC, highlights the significant and diverse [[industrial_applications_of_causal_inference | industrial applications]] of [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]] and causal inference. He emphasizes that the ultimate purpose of data science is to facilitate better actions and decisions, a goal for which [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]], particularly when combined with causal thinking, is uniquely suited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## From Academia to Finance: Early Realizations
Dr. Wiecki's journey into [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]] began with a fascination for programming and bioinformatics, eventually leading him to fall in love with [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A pivotal moment came when he realized these tools weren't just for academic research but were highly applicable in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

During his time at Quantopian, a fintech startup focused on building a crowdsourced hedge fund, he found that [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]] effectively solved problems related to portfolio construction and algorithm evaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This experience demonstrated that the same [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian tools]] could solve "completely orthogonal problems," solidifying his belief in their broad utility across data science where a deep understanding and incorporation of domain knowledge into the model are needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Bridging Causality and Bayesian Methods
A core theme in Dr. Wiecki's work is the powerful connection between [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]] and causality. He notes that these two fields have largely developed independently, yet there are many interesting cross-connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. The recent addition of the causal `do-operator` to PyMC is a significant step, enabling the framework to answer structural causal problems and build relevant models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

Historically, Dr. Wiecki observed that while both Bayesian frameworks and [[causality_in_science_and_industry | causal inference]] involve building structural models (often called "data generative processes" in Bayesian contexts), the explicit connection was not widely recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Now, he asserts that these two approaches are fundamentally the same, viewed through different lenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. While [[causality_in_science_and_industry | causal inference]] often operates within a frequentist framework, there is immense value in expressing these ideas within a [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian framework]], which offers advantages in transparency and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Addressing [[challenges_in_deploying_causal_models_in_industry | Industry Challenges]] through Causal Bayesian Models
Dr. Wiecki argues that [[role_of_causality_and_bayesian_methods_in_decision_making | talking about causality]] deeply resonates with business stakeholders, as it aligns with the intuitive need to understand "what causes what" to take effective action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This is crucial for making better decisions, which he identifies as the ultimate purpose of data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

### Prediction vs. Decision-Making
A common "myth" in data science is that prediction and decision-making are the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. However, purely predictive models, while good at forecasting, often fail to explain *why* something happens or *how to intervene* to achieve a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. An example shared by the host, Alex Molak, highlights this: a company used predictive machine learning models for marketing for three years, resulting in "pure losses" because the models couldn't advise on effective actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

For most [[causal_machine_learning_applications_in_various_industries | business problems]], a [[role_of_causality_and_bayesian_methods_in_decision_making | causal approach]] is far more powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. While black-box ML algorithms are suitable for legitimate forecasting problems, Dr. Wiecki believes these are "way fewer than are getting applied to" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. Building models that map the [[causality_in_science_and_industry | causal structure]] of a problem, even if harder, is essential for solving actual business problems and ensuring the continued relevance of data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Importance of Explicit Structure and Iteration
One concern among practitioners is the fear of explicitly defining a structural causal model, fearing it might be "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Dr. Wiecki emphasizes that "it's great to be wrong" because that's how learning happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>. The iterative process of building a simple model, testing it against data (e.g., using posterior predictive checks or simulations), identifying discrepancies, and then refining the model with insights from domain experts leads to a deeper understanding of the data and a more accurate, trusted model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

This iterative approach, often described as "structural discovery," involves testing different hypotheses about how variables influence each other and observing the implications in the generated data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>. It allows for combining domain expertise with data-driven insights, leading to more robust solutions and greater trust from stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.

### Managing Uncertainty and Risk in Decision-Making
[[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian modeling]] provides a natural and organic way to estimate uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:29">[00:44:29]</a>. While other methods like conformal prediction offer total uncertainty, Bayesian frameworks can often split uncertainty into aleatoric (inherent randomness) and epistemic (lack of knowledge) components, which can be useful in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:54">[00:47:54]</a>.

A key benefit of incorporating uncertainty, particularly in [[applications_of_causal_models_in_business_and_marketing | business contexts]] like marketing mix modeling, is its use in optimization. Instead of just providing point estimates with error bars, [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian models]] allow uncertainty estimates to be fed into an optimizer. This enables decisions that account for risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. For example, an optimizer using Bayesian uncertainty will naturally favor marketing channels with abundant, low-uncertainty data over new channels with limited data, even if the latter shows a high point estimate of effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. This aligns with how humans make decisions, which are often risk-averse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>.

## PyMC's Future: More Causal Applications
The PyMC ecosystem is increasingly focusing on [[causal_ai_applications_in_various_industries | causal applications]]. The `CausalPy` package, for instance, focuses on quasi-experimentation, allowing users to fit either scikit-learn or [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian models]] to predict out-of-sample periods and compare them to actual outcomes, with the Bayesian approach providing uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

Despite historical skepticism, Dr. Wiecki believes there's nothing stopping [[probabilistic_modeling_and_bayesian_frameworks | Bayesian frameworks]] from incorporating concepts like interventions (e.g., the `do-operator`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>. By approaching these challenges with "fresh eyes," new and improved tools can be developed, making PyMC an increasingly powerful direction for [[causal_ai_applications_in_various_industries | causal AI applications]] and [[causal_machine_learning_in_medicine_and_industry | machine learning in industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

Time series analysis in causal inference, particularly within the context of N-of-1 trials (single-subject studies), presents unique [[challenges_in_causal_inference_and_statistical_analysis | challenges]]. While N-of-1 trials are designed for personalized models and generalize to the individual rather than a broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, the time series nature introduces specific complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

## Key Challenges in Time Series Settings

### Carryover Effects
A primary challenge is [[challenges_in_causal_analysis_in_different_settings | carryover effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This occurs when a treatment or exposure at one point in time impacts future outcomes, inducing "serial interference" over time within the same individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Serial interference means that one's treatment at time point one affects their potential outcomes at time point two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. However, interference generally cannot happen backward in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Autocorrelation
Another challenge is simple autocorrelation, where an individual's outcome at one point (e.g., migraine chances tomorrow) is affected by their outcome at a previous point (e.g., migraine chances today) due to underlying predispositions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### Exogenous Factors
[[challenges_in_identifying_causal_relationships | Exogenous factors]], such as weather, can also affect outcomes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. These factors are not influenced by the treatment or the outcome itself but can impact both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

### Non-Stationarity
A significant upfront challenge in time series analysis is non-stationarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:37">[00:41:37]</a>. While classic N-of-1 trials are designed to be fairly stationary due to their controlled nature and short duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>, real-world applications face difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:43]</a>. Non-stationarity implies that the statistical properties of the time series (like averages) change over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges

### Design Considerations
Effective study design is paramount. As Rubin's quote emphasizes, "design trumps analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Key aspects at the design stage include:
*   Clearly defining the study question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.
*   Specifying variables, measurement methods, and feasibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>.
*   Considering the timeline and data collection strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:21">[00:23:21]</a>.
*   For N-of-1 trials, treatments should be chosen such that their effects wash out, allowing for repeated randomization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### Statistical Methodologies
The primary statistical difference in time series settings is the replacement of the independence assumption (between participants) with assumptions like stationarity and conditional independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. This requires controlling for factors like lag and autocorrelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.

Strategies to deal with non-stationarity include:
*   **Formalizing variables and concerns:** Setting up a framework to address variables and potential issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.
*   **Markov chain processes:** Examining latent states and transitions, though this may alter the original study question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Stationarization:** Techniques like taking the first difference of a time series can make it stationary, but this changes the study question to focus on the derivative or difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
*   **Diagnostics:** Incorporating diagnostics in modeling to detect shifts in the time series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. Tests for stationarity on residuals are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:22">[00:44:22]</a>.
*   **Segmentation:** If a time series is stationary only for certain periods, it can be segmented using methods like changepoint detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:37">[00:44:37]</a>.

### Causal Frameworks
Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs), popularized by Pearl, are considered very useful for [[challenges_in_causal_inference_and_statistical_analysis | causal identification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Their visual nature helps in understanding relationships and specifying models, especially in [[time_series_causal_discovery | time series]] settings where recursive DAGs help visualize arrows from the past to the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.

## Future Directions
The field of N-of-1 trials and single-case designs is advancing. Areas of future focus include:
*   **Functional Data Analysis (FDA):** Instead of just looking at average values, FDA examines the entire curve of an outcome over a period (e.g., daily step counts or blood glucose curves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:59">[00:45:59]</a>.
*   **Connecting Causal Inference to Control Theory and System Identification:** This interdisciplinary approach aims to use engineering techniques to model and optimize human behavior, like using impulse response system identification to achieve stable points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>. This is particularly relevant for understanding and building reliable world models in agentic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

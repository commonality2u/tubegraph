Explainable AI (XAI) and feature importance are crucial for understanding and trusting artificial intelligence models. This field focuses on making complex model decisions transparent and interpretable, particularly by identifying which features are most influential in a model's output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Core Concepts in Explanations

In the context of [[Machine Learning and Explainability | explainable AI]] frameworks, two fundamental concepts are critical for understanding feature importance: sufficiency and necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

- **Sufficiency:** A feature is considered "sufficient" if its presence alone is enough to maintain the classification as it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
- **Necessity:** A feature is "necessary" if changing its value would cause the classification to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

## Challenges in Interpreting Feature Importance

One of the main challenges in [[Machine Learning and Explainability | Explainable AI]] is the ambiguous nature of feature importance rankings. The same ranking can be interpreted in various ways, leading to confusion about what exactly the model considers "important" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. For example, a high importance score for a feature could mean it's crucial for the current classification, or it could mean that changing it would significantly alter the output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## The Role of "Explanandum"

To address interpretation ambiguity, the concept of "explanandum" is introduced. An explanandum is a clearly defined, specific question about what needs to be interpreted from a feature importance ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Defining the explanandum ensures that the explanation provided by an XAI framework directly answers a user's specific query <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

## Impact of Neighborhoods on Explanations

[[Machine Learning and Explainability | Explainable AI]] frameworks, such as SHAP, LIME, and DiCE (a [[Counterfactual Explanations and Model Explainability | counterfactual]] library), are highly sensitive to the "neighborhoods" they use for generating explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Different neighborhoods can produce varying or even false explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Research suggests that "outside-based neighborhoods," which focus on samples outside the decision boundary, tend to perform well in conveying feature sufficiency and necessity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

### Key Learnings:
- It is crucial to experiment with different neighborhoods to find the one that best conveys the desired explanandum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
- There is no "no free lunch theorem" in [[Machine Learning and Explainability | Explainable AI]]; no single framework will universally work and be reliable across all scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.
- Users must clearly define their explanatory requirements to ensure that explanations are useful and avoid mere "checkbox exercises" for compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. Understanding the full picture of a model often requires using multiple XAI frameworks with different neighborhood contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

## Real-World Impact and Future Directions

The goal of this research is to promote more "true forms" of explanations with well-defined explananda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. This approach can prevent the superficial application of XAI for ethical permissions and instead ensure that explanations genuinely represent the model to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. For example, in the medical domain, a defined explanandum could help clinicians understand if further diagnostic tests are needed based on a model's feature importance ranking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

Ultimately, the focus should be less on developing novel XAI frameworks that merely produce another ranking, and more on standardizing concepts, defining clear explananda, and ensuring explanations drive actionable insights for users <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>.

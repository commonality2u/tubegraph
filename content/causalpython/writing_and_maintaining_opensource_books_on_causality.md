From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 
Matheus Furi, an author and staff data scientist at one of Brazil's largest banks, has written an open-source book on causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:50">[00:50:50]</a>. This book was later structured into a published format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:50">[01:02:50]</a>.

## Motivation for Writing
Furi's motivation for creating the open-source book was primarily personal and stemmed from the COVID-19 pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>. During the 2020 lockdown, he wanted to learn econometrics well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. His approach was to translate a course by Joshua Angrist and Alberto Abadie into written material with Python examples and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>, often using fetched or simulated data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:11">[01:00:11]</a>. He views writing and teaching as powerful tools for learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

## Content and Approach
The book's first part is essentially a Python translation of Joshua Angrist's econometrics course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>. Part two incorporates the applied practices and discussions on machine learning and effect heterogeneity from his work at Nubank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

Furi emphasizes revisiting basics, with the regression chapter being his favorite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. He also enjoyed writing about causal model evaluation, an area he believes he has contributed to, especially regarding continuous treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Challenges in Writing and Maintaining
The biggest challenge for Furi in writing the book was juggling family duties with writing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Although much of the content was pre-written for his online book, the arrival of a child made the process much harder than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. He credits his company for granting him a four-month paternity leave, which he extended with an extra month of vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The sheer work and working around a schedule to maintain quality were the hardest parts, not the content's complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

Maintaining the open-source book with updates is also a challenge due to work and family commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>.

## Benefits of Open-Source Publishing
Furi values feedback from the community, which helps him learn by correcting errors and clarifying concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:14">[01:01:14]</a>. He believes that open-source books or those by authors like Alex are excellent starting points for learning causality because they synthesize information that previously had to be pieced together from many papers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Authors and Learners
### General Advice for Data Scientists
Furi advises data scientists to adopt a broader perspective: machine learning models are only a small piece of a larger system designed for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The goal is to design systems that are *overall* better, leading to optimal decisions, rather than just better predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### Recommended Resources
*   **Books on Causality:** Furi recommends his own book and Alex's book as good starting points, as they summarize the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.
*   **American Economics Association Webcasts:** He particularly likes the econometrics course by Joshua Angrist and Alberto Abadie from 2020, which focuses on theory without coding, covering fundamentals like treatment effects, counterfactuals, and framing problems as decision-making or notation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. He believes these fundamentals are crucial for applied settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

### The Importance of Communication
Furi stresses the importance of writing well and structuring thoughts effectively for both written and spoken communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In a big company, or when working with diverse backgrounds (e.g., engineering, product), effective communication is essential to translate technical challenges without "dumbing it down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Future of the Book
Furi plans to continue updating the open-source book, with current thoughts on formalizing his ideas about reinforcement learning's relation to causal inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>.

## Relevance to [[open_source_causal_ai_libraries | Causal Python Community]]
Furi believes the [[open_source_causal_ai_libraries | Causal Python community]] is in a strong position due to Python's practicality for applying causal inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:40">[01:03:40]</a>. The community offers easily deployable models, unlike R, which is less suited for production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:07">[01:04:07]</a>. There are also many materials and maturing [[open_source_causal_ai_libraries | libraries]] like EconML and DoWhy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:22">[01:04:22]</a>. The machine learning environment in Python is also well-suited for causal analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.

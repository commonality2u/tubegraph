Active learning, particularly observed in children, involves interacting with the environment to gain knowledge and build [[child_learning_through_play | effective world models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:20">[01:55:20]</a>. This contrasts with a more static approach to learning, which is typical for many contemporary [[machine_learning_versus_causal_inference_for_decisionmaking | machine learning]] systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Children's Active Learning
Children frequently engage in behaviors that appear aggressive, such as throwing blocks or toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. However, this behavior often serves as a method for children to learn how the physical world operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

### Systematic Experimentation
Developmental psychologist Alison Gopnik has shown that children conduct systematic experiments to understand the laws of physics and the rules governing social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Research by Amy St. and Lisa Fenson from Johns Hopkins University indicates that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects that exhibit unpredictable properties, such as toys that can pass through walls, rather than predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Active Interaction
The ability of infants to actively interact with their environment makes their learning more robust compared to merely observing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This interaction also guides them in determining which hypotheses to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>, creating an interactive cycle of hypothesis formation and testing aimed at falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This interactive process provides children with a powerful set of tools for building effective world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Comparison to Machine Learning
One significant difference between [[comparison_between_child_learning_and_machine_learning | children's learning]] and how most [[machine_learning_versus_causal_inference_for_decisionmaking | machine learning]] systems learn lies in this active engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a>. While children continually interact and experiment, most contemporary [[machine_learning_versus_causal_inference_for_decisionmaking | machine learning]] systems typically learn in a more static manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. The consequences of learning in a static versus a more active way will be explored further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

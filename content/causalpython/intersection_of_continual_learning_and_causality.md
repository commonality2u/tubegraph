The "continual cality" program is described as the [[Intersection of Continual Learning and Causality | intersection of continual learning and causality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:33">[01:47:33]</a>. This initiative is a "bridge program" that participants are involved in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:51">[01:45:51]</a>. Both continual learning and causality frameworks are concerned with "change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:91">[01:58:91]</a>, which is considered essential for AI in an "everchanging world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:81">[02:00:81]</a>. This program is part of the 38th annual "advancements in artificial intelligence" conference held in Vancouver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:91">[03:57:91]</a>.

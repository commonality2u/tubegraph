Research presented at the Clear Conference on Causal Learning and Representation highlights the utility of [[applications_of_causal_models_in_biology_and_ai | causal models]] in understanding complex climate phenomena <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Research by Gavin the Bear

Gavin the Bear, a researcher at the German Aerospace Center in Munich, focuses on applying [[structural_causal_models_and_causal_discovery | causal discovery]] methods to climate time series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

### Conference Presentation

At the conference, Gavin presented a paper detailing the use of bootstrap aggregation to provide confidence measures for edges outputted by time series [[structural_causal_models_and_causal_discovery | causal discovery]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. The research empirically found that the aggregated graph resulting from bootstrap aggregation yielded higher precision and recall compared to baseline methods tested in empirical experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

### Desired Real-World Impact

Gavin aims to see his methods applied to climate time series to better understand how climate processes are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This understanding could clarify how climate change impacts these processes within climate models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Furthermore, he hopes the work can help determine if climate models accurately represent these processes in historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Personal Insights

A significant personal learning experience for Gavin during this project was working on a paper with many collaborators, which taught him how to write and navigate the review process in a group setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Recommended Causal Paper

Gavin recommends a review paper by Gustav Comfiles from the University of Valencia titled "Discovering Causal Relationships and Equations from Data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. This paper reviews current methods for estimating relationships and equations from data, and discusses opportunities and [[challenges_in_evaluating_causal_models | challenges]] in the domain, particularly relevant for physical sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

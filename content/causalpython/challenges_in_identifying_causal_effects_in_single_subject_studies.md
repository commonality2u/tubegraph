From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 

Single subject studies, often referred to as N-of-1 trials, focus on understanding causal relationships within a single individual over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These trials are typically randomized, crossover designs where a person experiments on themselves, for example, by randomizing coffee consumption daily to observe its effect on sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Generalizability
N-of-1 trials are not primarily designed for generalization to a broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Instead, they are [[causal_inference_and_individual_treatment_effects | personalized models]] meant to generalize to the individual themselves, helping them understand patterns specific to their own physiology or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:06">[02:09:06]</a>. While generalizing to others is a secondary question, it can be approached using methods like mixed-effects models, where N-of-1 differs by allowing models per person to vary more significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:04">[02:24:04]</a>.

These designs are particularly useful when outcomes have highly heterogeneous triggers across individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For instance, coffee might worsen migraines for one person but prevent them for another; a standard randomized control trial would show no average treatment effect due to these canceling effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

## Core Challenges in N-of-1 Studies
[[challenges_in_implementing_causal_analysis_in_practice | Identifying causal effects]] in single-subject, time-series settings presents several [[challenges and future directions in causal inference | challenges]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>:
*   **Carryover Effects (Serial Interference):** A treatment received at one point in time might impact outcomes at a future time point. This is a form of serial interference, where the treatment effect "carries over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Unlike standard interference between people, serial interference happens within the same person over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Autocorrelation:** Present outcomes may be affected by past outcomes, such as migraine chances today influencing chances tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Exogenous Factors:** External variables not affected by the treatment or outcome (e.g., weather) can influence outcomes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Non-Stationarity:** The underlying distribution of the outcome might change over time, violating the assumption of stationarity (where averages remain consistent over a given span) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference:** Even in N-of-1 trials, at any given time, only one exposure or treatment can be observed, making it impossible to know the counterfactual outcome directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:15">[00:41:15]</a>.

## Addressing Challenges in N-of-1 Design and Analysis
When designing N-of-1 studies, attention to detail at the design, implementation, and analysis stages is crucial for trustworthy conclusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Controlled Settings:** In classic N-of-1 trials, clinicians and patients co-design the study, allowing control over treatments, washout periods (time for treatment effects to disappear before re-randomizing), and ensuring the time series remains relatively stationary by design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:47">[00:41:47]</a>.
*   **Statistical Assumptions:** The typical independence assumption between participants in group trials is replaced by assumptions like stationarity and ensuring errors are independent after accounting for lag and autocorrelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:52">[01:12:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>.
*   **Dealing with Non-Stationarity:**
    *   **Stationarization:** Techniques like taking the first difference can make a time series stationary, but this changes the study question to focus on the derivative or difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:39">[00:43:39]</a>.
    *   **Segmentation:** [[optimal_experimentation_in_causal_analysis | Changepoint detection]] and similar methods can identify stationary periods within a longer time series, allowing for segmented analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
    *   **Markov Chain Processes:** Some approaches use Markov chain type processes to look at latent states and transitions, but this also shifts the study question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>.
*   **Causal Identification Frameworks:** While various frameworks exist, the Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG) framework from Pearl is particularly useful. Its visual nature helps in mapping out relationships and identifying whether an effect is identifiable, especially in time-series settings where recursive DAGs illustrate past-to-present influences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:31">[01:18:31]</a>.

## Key Concepts and Metrics
*   **Average Period Treatment Effect (APTE):** Similar to the Average Treatment Effect (ATE), but specific to single-subject studies, comparing outcomes across different time periods for the same person under different treatment levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Current Average Potential Outcome (CAPO):** A term defined by Dr. Daza, based on work by Hudgens and Howarin, to describe the average potential outcome at a given time point, considering all possible past treatment streams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:30">[01:35:30]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Researchers
*   **Start with the Question:** The most important aspect is clearly defining the specific question you want to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This guides variable selection, measurement feasibility, and design choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **"Design Trumps Analysis":** As stated by Don Rubin, thorough study design is paramount. Without a well-designed study, even advanced analysis may yield unreliable or meaningless conclusions ("garbage in, garbage out") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Just Start Doing the Work:** Begin by tinkering with data, coding, and working through the math. Take small, manageable steps, as consistent effort leads to significant progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>. This hands-on approach helps identify practical [[challenges_of_implementing_causality_in_research_and_industry | challenges]] like dirty data or data collection issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>.

## Future Directions
The field is moving towards:
*   **Broader Adoption:** Popularizing N-of-1 design and implementation through initiatives like the NF1 Collaborative Network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>.
*   **Connecting Fields:** Integrating N-of-1 trials with other areas like:
    *   **Functional Data Analysis:** Analyzing entire curves of data over time (e.g., daily step counts or blood glucose curves) rather than just averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Control Theory and System Identification:** Applying engineering techniques to understand human behavior and optimize interventions to achieve stable points or desired states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. This is timely given the interest in agentic systems and learning reliable world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

## Software Ecosystem
Several platforms and packages support N-of-1 trials, ranging from self-data collection apps to analysis tools. Examples include "Tummy Trials" for irritable bowel syndrome (though its current status is unclear), "Migraine Buddy" for self-tracking, and the "Study Me" package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. Resources for these tools and related literatures (psychology, education, time series, econometrics, finance's "switchback experiments") are often compiled by specialized newsletters or networks like Stats of One <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

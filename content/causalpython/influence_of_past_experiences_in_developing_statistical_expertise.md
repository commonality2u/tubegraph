Developing statistical expertise can be a multifaceted journey, often shaped by unexpected paths, personal challenges, and a diverse range of prior experiences. Dr. Eric Daza, a principal clinical data scientist at a leading pharma company, shares his unique trajectory from neurobiology and music to statistics, highlighting the profound influence of his background on his professional focus, particularly in N-of-1 trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## An Unexpected Path to Statistics

Dr. Daza initially pursued neurobiology in undergraduate studies, driven by an interest in consciousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. However, his academic focus was significantly influenced by his involvement in theater and music, as a trained concert pianist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>, which at times "distracted the hell" out of him from homework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. His grades showed an inverse curve to his theater involvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. A turning point came during a cognitive studies course with a lab component, where he designed an experiment, collected data, and performed analysis, sparking his interest in data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### The Catalytic Master's Program
Towards the end of his undergraduate degree, his university introduced a new one-year master's program in applied statistics, which Dr. Daza humorously calls a "statistically significant moment" that guided his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. Despite not being a math major and having previous academic struggles, he prepared intensely for the program, citing it as one of his proudest moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

### From Pharma to Doctorate
After his master's, Dr. Daza worked as a master's-level biostatistician in pharma for about five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. During this time, he realized he wanted a deeper understanding of the underlying statistical concepts behind the programming he was doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He self-deprecatingly attributes his pursuit of a doctorate to a "pretty bad memory," needing to repeatedly push concepts into his brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.

Initially, he applied to ten doctoral programs in biostatistics and was rejected from all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. However, a helpful admissions director at UNC Chapel Hill provided targeted advice on courses to take to become more competitive, which he followed for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. This preparation led him to take a causal inference course by Mark van der Laan, a pivotal experience where he learned about a field he hadn't even heard of before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

## Personal Connection to N-of-1 Trials
His eventual focus on N-of-1 trials stemmed from three streams:
1.  His interest in [[education_and_paradigm_shift_in_causal_inference|causal inference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
2.  Exposure to Professor Susan Murphy's work on dynamic treatment regimes, a branch of [[education_and_paradigm_shift_in_causal_inference|causal inference]] focused on personalized approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
3.  A loved one's chronic condition, irritable bowel syndrome, which is amenable to treatment with N-of-1 trials due to its idiosyncratic nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

His advisor in grad school, Hudgens, also worked in the interference literature, further influencing his interest in N-of-1 trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.

## The Role of Personal Traits and Persistence

Dr. Daza revealed a later diagnosis of ADHD, which explained his earlier difficulties with focus and his development of procrastination strategies involving breaking down work into small chunks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He emphasizes that statistics was "one of the hardest things I have ever done" and that he "worked my butt off at it" rather than being a "natural" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Music
The influence of music on his statistical thinking is subtle but present. He notes the repeating "bars" in Western musical notation as analogous to the time periods in time series analysis, which resonated with his work on N-of-1 trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. In a "super nerdy" revelation, he shared that he named a quantity in his newest paper, "current average potential outcome," as "capo," a deliberate nod to the musical device <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

## Broader Perspectives on Learning
The host's journey also reflects unexpected turns, starting from a childhood realization about perspective, leading to philosophy, formal logic, music production, and later psychology and neuroscience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. A simple explanation of sigma notation in an introductory statistics class was a breakthrough, demystifying complex mathematical notation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. His experience with statistical methods in psychology that weren't "causally meaningful" and hitting "the same wall" with machine learning led him to [[education_and_paradigm_shift_in_causal_inference|causality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

## Advice for Aspiring Statisticians

Dr. Daza offers practical advice for those entering advanced fields like statistics, machine learning, and [[education_and_paradigm_shift_in_causal_inference|causality]]:

*   **"Just start doing the work"**: Get into the data, start coding, work through the math <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Take small steps**: Break down daunting challenges into manageable pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the study question**: Before collecting data or choosing methods, clearly define "what is the question you're trying to answer?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This is the "root of really good science" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.
*   **"Design trumps analysis"**: Quoting Don Rubin, Dr. Daza emphasizes that careful design regarding variables, timelines, and data collection methods is more important than analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. Otherwise, it's "garbage in, garbage out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Be aware of assumptions**: When modeling, it's crucial to specify and evaluate the assumptions being made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

Statistical reasoning, Dr. Daza notes, can extend beyond professional work to help understand personal interactions and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.

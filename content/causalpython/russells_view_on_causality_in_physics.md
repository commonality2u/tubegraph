Bertrand Russell, an iconic British philosopher, famously asserted over a century ago that [[Causality and Causal Models | causality]] is "a relic of the bygone age" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This statement is a central point of discussion regarding the [[Interplay between physics and causal inference | role of causality]] in science, particularly its application in physics versus other scientific disciplines.

## Russell's Core Argument
Russell's argument stemmed from the prevailing understanding of physics during his time, specifically gravitational astronomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He likely observed that physical theories could function effectively without explicitly invoking causal notions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. Historical 19th-century physics textbooks, for example, might have presented forces as causes or acceleration causing velocity, but Russell and Ernst Mach realized these causal interpretations weren't strictly necessary for the physical theory itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Rebuttal and Nuance
Dr. Naftali Weinberger, a philosopher of science, strongly argues that Russell's assertion that [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] is a "relic of a bygone age" is clearly incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. He points to the pervasive need for [[Causality and Causal Models | causal knowledge]] in numerous sciences and industries today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Weinberger highlights that Russell's perspective was limited by the physics of his era, which predated quantum mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. A key undefended assumption Russell might have held was that for [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] to be scientifically legitimate, it must play a role in fundamental physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Weinberger argues that the scientific legitimacy of [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] should not be questioned, given its extreme usefulness across fields like epidemiology, sociology, and industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He emphasizes that even if there's no [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] in fundamental physics, this does not preclude its existence or importance at higher levels of description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Russell's Partial Vindication and Ongoing Debate
Despite the criticisms, Weinberger concedes that Russell has been "vindicated" in at least one important sense: the idea that [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] is not particularly controversial in physics has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>. Now, arguing for a role for [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] in physics, as Matthias Frisch does in "Causal Reasoning in Physics," requires explicit argumentation, which was not the case before Russell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

The question of whether there is [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] in physics remains controversial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Physicists sometimes use a "principle of causality" to refer to a locality principle, which is distinct from the causal relations depicted in causal graphs used in other sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:49">[00:24:49]</a>. While [[Causality and Causal Models | causal reasoning]] is clearly present in some areas of physics, such as building a Large Hadron Collider where interventions are performed, its presence in fundamental physics is still an open question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.

## Causality, Scales, and Emergence
Weinberger's work often focuses on [[Causality in dynamical systems | causation at different time scales]] and how phenomena can appear differently depending on the scale at which a system is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This concept directly challenges Russell's implicit assumption that [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] must apply uniformly across all levels.

When considering complex systems, particularly the notion of emergence, the idea of [[Causality and Causal Models | causal relationships]] being relative to a time scale becomes crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. What might appear as chaotic or non-causal at a lower, more fundamental level (like quantum scale) can exhibit clear patterns of regularity and [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] at a higher level (e.g., Newtonian physics) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. This means that a property observed at one spatiotemporal scale does not necessarily mean it will be absent at another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:17">[00:17:17]</a>.

The debate about [[Intersection of quantum physics and causality | causality in physics]] also touches upon the applicability of interventions. There is a literature on Bell's inequalities and EPR experiments in quantum mechanics that suggests reasons to doubt whether these phenomena can be given a coherent [[Causality and Causal Models | causal interpretation]] via interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>. This raises the "live possibility" that [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] might break down at certain scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:33">[00:26:33]</a>. However, even if this is true, it does not threaten the existence of [[Causality and Causal Models | causation]] at other, higher levels in a meaningful sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

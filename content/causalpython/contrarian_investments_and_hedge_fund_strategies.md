The decision to found Cal Al, a company focused on causal AI, was described as a "contrarian bet" in 2017 when causal inference was a niche topic [00:00:07]. This contrarian approach was significantly influenced by prior experiences in the hedge fund industry [00:01:03].

## Lessons from the Hedge Fund World

Both the founder and co-founder, Max, had backgrounds in the hedge fund world; Max, a physicist, transitioned into this field [00:01:07]. Two key lessons emerged from this experience that shaped their entrepreneurial direction:

1.  **The Nature of Patterns in Real-World Finance**:
    *   In the financial markets, the past "almost never repeats" [00:02:18].
    *   Relying solely on historical patterns and correlations, as is common in some deep learning applications, can lead to significant problems in the real world [00:02:07].
    *   Patterns in the real world can change rapidly, meaning that past data is "not necessarily predictive of the future" [00:03:13].

2.  **The Value of Contrarian Views**:
    *   A core lesson from hedge funds is that "the way to win big is to take a contrarian view" [00:02:27].
    *   Conforming to what everyone else is doing yields limited returns [00:02:30].
    *   Substantial gains are achieved by doing "something completely different from everybody else," provided that the contrarian view is also correct [00:02:37].

### Contrarian Bet on Causal AI

In 2017, following an article about AlphaGo's success, there was widespread excitement about deep learning, with many pivoting their AI research towards it [00:01:24]. However, the founders held a [[counterfactual_reasoning_in_decision_making | contrarian view]], recognizing deep learning's limitations in real-world scenarios compared to its effectiveness in fixed-rule environments like board games [00:01:51]. They understood that simply learning historical patterns could lead to trouble in the real world, a phenomenon they had observed in the hedge fund industry [00:02:07]. Their bet on [[causal_inference_in_finance | causal AI]] proved to be a "contrarian bet that was right" [00:02:49].# Contrarian Investments and Hedge Fund Strategies

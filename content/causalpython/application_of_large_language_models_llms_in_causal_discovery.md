The intersection of [[Large Language Models and causation | Large Language Models]] (LLMs) and [[Causality and Large Language Models | causality]] is an exciting and promising area of development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>. LLMs offer a significant opportunity to enhance and expedite the process of [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] in practical applications, particularly in corporate environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.

## Expediting Causal Discovery

One of the primary challenges in [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] is the time-consuming nature of gathering meaningful relationships and building initial causal graphs from domain experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. Interviewing numerous experts can take dozens of hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>.

[[Large Language Models and causation | LLMs]] can help by:
*   **Generating initial causal graphs:** Instead of starting from scratch, LLMs can be used to identify [[causality_and_large_language_models | causal relationships]] and build a preliminary [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] graph based on available data or prompts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This provides a starting point for discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.
*   **Facilitating expert validation:** Experts can then validate or criticize the LLM-generated graph, adding their unique knowledge and experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This approach leverages experts' desire to validate and show their knowledge, making the process more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
*   **Boosting efficiency:** Initial experiments have shown that LLMs can generate causal graphs surprisingly close to ground truth with just one or two prompts, significantly reducing the time spent on initial data gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>.

> "Instead of starting from scratch...I just go to LLMs and try to find these causal relationships, build already a causal discovery graph and then let the expert validate it or he can criticize it which is also good for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>

## LLMs as a Recommendation System

The application of [[Large Language Models and causation | LLMs]] in [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] can be viewed as using them as a recommendation system, providing a foundation that experts can build upon rather than replacing their role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>. This approach fosters trust with stakeholders, who see the models as an extension of their own brain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

## Limitations and Future Directions

While promising, the integration of [[Large Language Models and causation | LLMs]] with [[causality_and_large_language_models | causal AI]] methods is still being explored. For example, LLMs are known for "hallucinating," and techniques like retrieval augmented generation (RAG) can help mitigate this by grounding their responses in external knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:35">[00:47:35]</a>.

The future of dashboarding and decision-making could involve combining [[Causality and large language models | causal AI]] with [[Large Language Models and causation | LLMs]], allowing users to ask natural language questions about causal effects (e.g., "Tell me which supplier will be affected if there's a tsunami in Miami?") and receive quantified answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.

## Key Takeaways

*   [[Large Language Models and causation | LLMs]] can significantly improve the efficiency of [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] by providing initial causal graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:53">[00:21:53]</a>.
*   They serve as a starting point for expert validation, reducing the initial burden on human experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.
*   The integration of [[Large Language Models and causation | LLMs]] and [[causality_and_large_language_models | causal AI]] is an area of active research, with potential for transformative applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

> "Just after two or three prompts you can get so amazing results which is so closer to the ground truth and that definitely makes sense of instead of starting things from scratch using this as a recommendation and then build something more meaningful meaningful to that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a>

The [[Workshop on Large Language Models and Causality at AAAI 2024 | AAAI 2024 Workshop on Large Language Models and Causality]] is highlighted as an important resource for keeping up with the latest research in this field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Parents may observe a child holding a block or toy and then throwing it away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Sometimes, parents react negatively to such behaviors, interpreting them as aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, most of the time, children throw things because it aids their learning process, helping them understand how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## [[child_learning_through_play | Child Learning Through Play]]

This active form of learning is one way [[comparison_between_child_learning_and_machine_learning | children's learning]] differs from how most [[comparison_between_child_learning_and_machine_learning | machine learning systems]] typically acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   **Systematic Experiments**
    Alison Gopnik, an American [[developmental_psychology_studies_on_infants | developmental psychologist]], has shown that children perform systematic experiments to learn the laws of physics and the rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Preference for Unpredictability**
    Research by Amy S. T. and Lisa Feigenson from Johns Hopkins University indicates that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects that display unpredictable properties (e.g., toys that pass through walls) rather than playing with more predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Robust Learning**
    Infants' ability to interact with the world not only makes their learning more robust compared to merely observing the environment, but it also guides them on which hypotheses to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This creates an interactive chain of hypotheses and tests aimed at falsifying them, providing children with a powerful toolkit for building effective "world models" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

This capability to actively interact with their environment distinguishes infants and children from most contemporary [[active_learning_versus_static_learning | machine learning systems]], which typically learn in a more static way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. The consequences of learning in a static versus a more active way are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

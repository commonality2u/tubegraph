## Understanding Infant Behavior

When a child holds a block or toy and throws it away, it can sometimes be interpreted by parents as aggressive behavior, leading to negative [[parent_reactions_to_childrens_behaviors | reactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, most of the time, children throw things because it helps them [[child_learning_through_play | learn]] how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This active form of [[child_learning_through_play | child learning]] is a key differentiator from how most [[comparison_between_child_learning_and_machine_learning | machine learning systems]] typically acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Infants as Active Experimenters

Developmental psychologists have demonstrated that infants engage in systematic experiments to understand their world:

*   **Allison Gopnik**, an American developmental psychologist, has shown that children perform systematic experiments to learn the laws of physics and the rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   Research by **Amy Stahl** and **Lisa Feigenson** from Johns Hopkins University indicates that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects displaying unpredictable properties (e.g., toys that pass through walls) rather than playing with more predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

This ability of infants to interact with the world not only makes their [[child_learning_through_play | learning]] more robust compared to merely observing the environment, but it also informs them which hypotheses to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This process creates an interactive chain of hypotheses and tests aimed at falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Together, these capabilities provide children with a powerful toolkit for building effective world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Comparison to Machine Learning

The capability of infants to actively interact with and experiment in their environment makes them different from most [[comparison_between_child_learning_and_machine_learning | contemporary machine learning systems]], which typically learn in a more static way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. The consequences of learning in a static versus a more active way will be explored further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Contest Background
A few weeks prior, a contest was launched asking participants to guess the guest of an upcoming episode of the *Causal Bandits* podcast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Many participants correctly identified the guest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### The Guest: Bernard Schölkopf
The mystery guest was Bernard Schölkopf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. His contributions to causality, causal machine learning, and machine learning in general are highly significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Schölkopf was a former PhD student of Vladimir Vapnik, one of the "Godfathers of modern machine learning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. He initially worked on kernel methods in machine learning before transitioning his focus to causality, where he invests a significant amount of his time today in causal research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### The Prize
The winner had the option to choose between a book offered by the host or a book co-authored by Bernard Schölkopf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:00">[03:49:00]</a>.

## Winner Selection

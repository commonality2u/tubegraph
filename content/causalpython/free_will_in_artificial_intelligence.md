The concept of free will, particularly in the context of [[Causality in Artificial Intelligence | artificial intelligence]] (AI), is a complex and speculative area for Professor Judea Pearl [00:11:32]. He notes that humans are constrained by resources, leading to quick decisions and "shortcuts" that introduce errors and biases [00:10:06]. Large machines, however, do not inherently possess these computational limitations and thus might not have the same biases as humans, as they can afford to search deeper and reach more reasoned conclusions [00:10:42]. However, they could be limited by the samples they can access, as "not everything is in the training set" [00:11:06].

## The Illusion of Free Will
Judea Pearl believes that the problem of free will, which philosophers refer to as the "scandal of science," will be resolved [00:26:44]. The "illusion of Free Will" evidently has some survival value, otherwise humans would not have been "hooked on this illusion for so many decades" [00:27:03].

## Computational Advantage
When [[Causality and AI Challenges and Opportunities | intelligence machines]] are exercised in a large number of environments, those that possess the "illusion of free will" are expected to survive and overcome others [00:27:24]. By understanding the "computational advantage" of this illusion, it could potentially be programmed into machines [00:27:34]. This would result in computer systems that act as though they have free will, even if they are merely "neural firing" [00:27:42]. Such systems would also be able to understand humans when they discuss their own free will [00:27:55].

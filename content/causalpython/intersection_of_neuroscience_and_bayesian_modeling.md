The intersection of neuroscience and [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian modeling]] explores the hypothesis that the human brain operates using [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian updating]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>. This idea suggests that humans begin with an initial understanding of how the world works, then apply that understanding, learn from new experiences, and subsequently update their beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. This process mirrors how [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian models]] learn and refine their estimates based on data.

## Human Brain and Causal Models

A key aspect of human cognition is the inherent ability to build causal models of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. This "causal model" that people construct in their minds is seen as an integral part of how they update their beliefs about the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a>. The compelling intuition is that if humans learn this way, then computers should also learn about the world in a similar fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a>.

## Decision Making and Risk Aversion

The principles of [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian modeling]] align with human decision-making processes, particularly concerning risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:10">[00:54:10]</a>. Humans are naturally risk-averse, a concept extensively researched in psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:26">[00:54:26]</a>. [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian models]] can incorporate a measure of risk (uncertainty) into their outputs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:32">[00:54:32]</a>. This means that unlike traditional point estimates, a [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian model]] can provide not just a single best estimate, but also the uncertainty surrounding that estimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>.

For instance, in a marketing context, an optimizer utilizing [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian modeling]] would prioritize a stable marketing channel with three years of data and low uncertainty over a newer channel with high effectiveness but only two months of data and high uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:16">[00:53:16]</a>. This behavior mirrors how a human decision-maker would likely act, preferring a safer choice with more reliable data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. This makes the solutions provided by [[Impact of Bayesian Modeling in Machine Learning | Bayesian models]] more actionable and trustworthy, as they account for risk in a way that resonates with human intuition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

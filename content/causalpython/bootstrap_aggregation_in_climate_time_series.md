Gavin Bear, a researcher at the German Aerospace Center in Munich, has been working on applying [[time_series_causal_discovery | causal discovery]] methods to climate time series data [00:00:20]. His research, presented at the CLEAR conference on Causal Learning and Representation, focuses on enhancing the reliability and interpretation of causal relationships in climate processes [00:00:10].

## Research Focus

Bear's specific work involved using **bootstrap aggregation** to provide confidence measures for the causal edges identified by [[time_series_causal_discovery | time series causal discovery]] methods [00:00:27]. Empirically, it was found that the aggregated graph resulting from bootstrap aggregation yielded higher precision and recall compared to the baseline method tested in their experiments [00:00:38].

## Real-World Impact

The aim of this research is to improve the understanding of how climate processes are interconnected [00:01:09]. By applying these methods to climate time series, researchers can better understand how climate change is impacting these processes, particularly as represented in climate models [00:01:14]. Furthermore, the work helps assess whether climate models accurately represent these processes in historical data [00:01:18].

## Key Learnings

A significant insight from this project was the experience of collaborating with a large group of people on a paper, learning how to write collaboratively and navigate the review process [00:01:35].

## Recommended Reading

Bear recommends a review paper titled "Discovering Causal Relationships and Equations from Data" by Gustav Comfiles from the University of Valencia [00:02:06]. This paper outlines current methods for estimating relationships and equations from data, and discusses opportunities and [[challenges_in_time_series_analysis | challenges]] in the domain, particularly relevant to physical sciences [00:02:23].

Dr. Juan Orus, a leading advocate for using causality in marketing, attributes much of his success in applied data science to his background in pure mathematics and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. His non-linear career path, which began with an interest in particle physics before focusing on geometry, has provided him with a unique perspective on solving complex problems in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Foundational Thinking from Mathematics

Orus emphasizes that a background in pure mathematics provides more than just theorems or tools; it teaches *how to learn to solve problems* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This includes:
*   **Problem Decomposition** When faced with a hard problem in industry, the approach learned from mathematics is to break it down, take it "piece by piece," and avoid being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Robust Toolset** Pure mathematics provides a "very strong toolbox," with linear algebra being a fundamental example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Orus believes that most industry problems can be reduced to a type of linear algebra problem if one has good knowledge of the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Systematic Problem-Solving** The discipline of mathematics, particularly understanding the structure of theorems (assumptions leading to results), teaches one to identify essential conditions and systematically remove unnecessary ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. This fosters a mindset of starting simple and iterating, which is crucial for delivering timely results in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Fundamentals** Orus advises focusing on foundational concepts like linear algebra and probability theory, as they form the "backbone of the theories" and provide long-term value, unlike rapidly changing "hot technologies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Neglecting these fundamentals can lead to confusion and difficulty in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>.

## Influence from Physics

Orus's background in physics, especially particle physics, taught him to model phenomena without overcomplicating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. This translates to:
*   **Simplification and Iteration** The approach in physics involves starting with the essence of a problem, modeling the most fundamental aspects, and then gradually adding complexity through experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Leveraging Symmetry** A key concept from physics, particularly Noether's theorem, is that "whenever you have a symmetry, there's a conserved quantity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This principle can be applied in modeling: recognizing patterns or symmetries allows for more efficient computations and simpler problem reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>. For example, understanding the rotational symmetry of concentric circles allows their separation using simple linear methods in polar coordinates, rather than complex algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. This concept of leveraging symmetries to gain something "for free" also applies to [[causality_in_science_and_industry | causality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>.

## Application in Causal Inference

The structured thinking derived from physics and pure mathematics is highly beneficial in [[understanding_and_applying_systematic_processes_in_causal_analysis | causal analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Orus's transition to data science, particularly his focus on marketing analytics, revealed the need for a more robust framework than traditional statistical models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

He discovered that [[role_of_causality_and_bayesian_methods_in_decision_making | Bayesian modeling]], specifically as introduced in *Statistical Rethinking* by Richard McElreath, provided a focus on [[causality_in_science_and_industry | causality]] that resonated with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. The [[role_of_causality_and_bayesian_methods_in_decision_making | Bayesian framework]] forces explicit statement of assumptions on the data generation process, which aligns with the structured thinking learned from pure mathematics and physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

The use of Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs) is a key tool that aligns with this mindset, allowing users to state assumptions graphically and then systematically derive the necessary model structure for estimation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. This transparency in stating assumptions is invaluable, even if the DAG itself is not directly used for model specification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>.

Orus advocates for combining different causal traditions, such as Judea Pearl's graphical models and Donald Rubin's potential outcomes framework, viewing them as complementary rather than separate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a>. This open-mindedness stems from the fundamental problem-solving approach.

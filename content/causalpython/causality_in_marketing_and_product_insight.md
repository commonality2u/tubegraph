The Cole AI conference 2024 at the Royal Society in London highlighted the incredible energy, willingness to share, and inspiration reminiscent of deep learning and machine learning events in 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant insight gained was the potential use of genes as instrumental variables in [[Causality in marketing and data science | causality]], as they are unlikely to have confounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Integrating Causal Approaches in Business

A key challenge identified is how to initiate a causal approach within a company and effectively apply this knowledge to address product-related questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. While intellectually interesting, implementing [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | causal AI]] requires significant cognitive effort from stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. There is enthusiasm for addressing these [[Challenges of implementing causality in research and industry | implementation challenges]] within companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Effective communication is crucial for successful causal analysis, from problem definition to modeling and transmitting knowledge to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. It's essential to communicate at the same level with both technical and non-technical personnel to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The ability to convey insights and ask appropriate questions that unlock problems is often the most difficult aspect, as there is no universal method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Investing in clear communication and understanding between individuals is fundamental for a project's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Causal Methods Across Industries

[[Application of causal methods in industry | Causal methods are being increasingly recognized and explored across various sectors]], with significant excitement around different types of causal inquiry, such as interventions and counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Marketing Applications

Fernanda Hin, a data scientist at Crowd, focuses on discovering new ways to implement [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | causality in the marketing world]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. She notes the value of observing how different companies approach similar problems, combining technical and business perspectives to contextualize "what if" questions for new problem-solving ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

A belief exists that there's a limited number of counterfactuals or "what if" questions that provide truly informative insights for a given problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. A primary challenge in the marketing industry is keeping pace with constant change, particularly in the realm of [[Machine learning and causality | AI and model implementation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. It's crucial to understand model assumptions and clearly articulate how AI complements rather than substitutes existing processes to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Pit, Head of Data Science at Crowd, aims to solve how effective marketing is and where to strategically spend resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. A major challenge in marketing is balancing interpretability with accuracy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Causal questions in marketing include understanding incrementality ("what if I had not done marketing?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>, and the long-term effectiveness of brand spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>. It's difficult to measure the long-term impact of brand marketing on immediate KPIs or how it enables performance marketing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.

A core challenge is resolving the conflict between CMOs wanting to increase marketing spend and CFOs seeking to curtail budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. [[Causality in marketing and data science | Causal AI]] helps answer questions about the outcome of different spending scenarios (more, less, or no marketing) to solve marketing effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

### Product Insight & Business Decisions

For product questions, an important challenge is defining the scope or "boundary" of a causal analysis diagram, deciding which factors are relevant and when to stop adding detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. A key concept to grasp is the distinction between identification and estimation in causal methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

[[Causal inference in business decisions at Spotify | Clara, a lead data scientist at BBVA AI Factory]], noted that the underlying question of "why things happened" and how different sectors (e.g., Spotify, travel, banking) answered it was a main insight from the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. In banking, a key causal question is how to understand factors influencing customers coping with debt to design solutions for both customers and the bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. A challenge is bringing external visions and testing new approaches internally within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Xavier, an expert data scientist at BBVA, emphasized learning how different companies approach [[Causality in marketing and data science | causality]] and gaining new ideas, such as counterfactual reasoning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. A specific causal question involves approaching problems where a causal effect estimation breaks the positivity assumption, especially in banking where domain knowledge can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:11:00]</a>. A major challenge is convincing business stakeholders about the importance of advanced analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

Al, a data scientist at BBVA, highlighted insights from [[Causal discovery and learning | causal discovery]] and [[application_of_causal_methods_in_industry | causal inference methods applied in different industries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. A question he would like to answer is how to ensure causal graphs are truly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. His main challenge is ensuring his estimated treatment effects are correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Hugo, a machine learning scientist at Booking.com, found insights in the discussion about assumptions in causal inference, particularly focusing on delivering useful results despite assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. His biggest causal question currently is the long-term viability of Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. In e-commerce, a main challenge is dealing with cannibalization and interference, and how to account for these in modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## The Value of Causal AI

Debora, founder of SEI, established her company to advise businesses on [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | AI strategies and workflows]], with a background in academic research in imaging and [[Machine learning and causality | machine learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. She considers [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | causal AI]] to be doing a great job in addressing the limitations of classical machine learning models by providing directional flows, feature importance, and contributing to explainable AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. Causal AI makes it easier to communicate with stakeholders and explain the rationale for certain decisions or options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Ultimately, it allows data scientists to differentiate between correlation and actual causation, a long-sought goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

Punith Gupta, a leader in the forecasting data science team at Cisco Systems, uses [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | causal AI]] to predict demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. He believes finding the "truth" won't come through traditional machine learning due to too many confusions, necessitating [[Causality in marketing and data science | causal inference]] to disentangle and find relationships and directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. A desired causal question is understanding the uncertainty in predicting a target when building a causal graph, as the true ground truth is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. His main challenge is resource limitation to answer all pressing questions, as [[Causality in marketing and data science | causal inference]] and [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | causal AI]] offer breakthrough solutions but are currently limited by available tools and personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>.

Arthur Maw, a senior data scientist at Sephora focusing on retail problems, states his main challenge is aligning [[Application of causal AI in marketing and business | causal AI insights]] with business intuition, integrating business insight into causal AI, and presenting causal results effectively to the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

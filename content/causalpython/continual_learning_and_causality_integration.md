From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 

The field of [[causality_in_artificial_intelligence | causality]] is being integrated with continual learning to address challenges in real-world applications of artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

## Definition and Purpose
"Continual causality" refers to the integration of the fields of continual learning and [[causality_and_causal_models | causality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>. The goal is to bridge these two areas to allow for scaling [[causality_and_machine_learning | causality]] and continual learning to real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Challenges and Opportunities
Combining continual learning and [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | causality]] is considered difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. A primary challenge identified is the lack of real-world applications and specific causal benchmarks to test models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>. Currently, empirical sections of papers often rely on synthetic data or limited datasets like Asia, highlighting a need to move towards more diverse and complex benchmarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Lack of Benchmarks
> The community needs to address the absence of specific causal benchmarks for testing models, as current empirical evaluations often rely on synthetic or limited datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>.

Despite the difficulties, there is a strong belief that the combination of both fields is necessary to scale [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | causality]] and continual learning to real-world applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. Researchers are actively working to bridge these two areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Community Message
A key message for the [[causality_and_machine_learning | causal AI]] community is the importance of scaling models and developing libraries with this scaling in mind. The continued lack of benchmarks is also a point of concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:16">[00:22:16]</a>.

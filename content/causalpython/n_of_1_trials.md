From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 

An N of 1 trial is a study conducted on a single individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In the context of clinical trials, it is a randomized trial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. These trials are essentially [[crossover_trials_vs_parallel_group_trials | crossover designs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a> and can also be referred to as time series designs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

## Purpose and Generalizability

N of 1 trials are not primarily meant to generalize to a broader population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Instead, they are [[personalized_experimental_design | personalized models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> designed to generalize to the individual being studied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Their main goal is to understand general patterns for that specific person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. While questions about broader population patterns are secondary, they can be explored using methods like mixed-effects models that borrow information across individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

These designs are particularly useful when dealing with outcomes that have highly heterogeneous triggers across different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. For example, coffee might worsen migraines for one person but prevent them for another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. In such cases, a standard randomized control trial (RCT) might show no average treatment effect because individual responses cancel out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. N of 1 trials help identify personal triggers and their recurring patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## Key Concepts and Challenges

### Example Scenario
An example of an N of 1 trial is experimenting on oneself to see if drinking coffee affects sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This would involve randomizing whether to drink coffee or not each day and then comparing average sleep duration under both conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

### Serial Interference
[[Causal Inference in Single Subject Studies | Serial interference]] refers to interference over time within the same individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. This means a treatment given at one time point can affect the potential outcomes at a later time point for the same person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Notably, interference cannot occur backwards in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

### Challenges in Time Series Settings
The main challenges in N of 1 trials, which are time series designs, include:
*   **Carryover Effects**: When a treatment's effect extends into the future, impacting later outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. This induces [[Causal Inference in Single Subject Studies | serial interference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Autocorrelation**: When an individual's outcome at one time point (e.g., migraine chance tomorrow) is affected by the outcome at a previous time point (e.g., migraine chance today) due to natural predisposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.
*   **Exogenous Factors**: External factors not affected by treatment or outcome but capable of influencing outcomes (e.g., weather affecting migraines or coffee consumption) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

### Average Period Treatment Effect (APTE)
The Average Period Treatment Effect (APTE) is an estimate used in N of 1 trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Similar to the Average Treatment Effect (ATE) in group-based trials, the APTE is an average effect between two or more treatment levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. The "period" part signifies that the comparison is made across different time periods for the same person, distinguishing it from ATE which typically compares effects between different people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>. It compares the individual's outcomes in time periods when they received one treatment versus another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

## Statistical Machinery and Frameworks

### Analysis in Single-Subject Studies
The largest difference in statistical analysis for N of 1 trials compared to standard group-based trials is the time series setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:35:00">[12:35:00]</a>. The independence assumption between participants in group trials is replaced by assumptions like stationarity for time series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a>. Stationarity implies that averages remain consistent over a given time span <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. While errors can still be independent after controlling for lag and autocorrelation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>, lagged outcomes commonly correlate with present outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.

### Non-Stationarity
Non-stationarity is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:37">[41:37]</a>. In highly controlled clinical N of 1 trials, factors are often controlled by design:
*   Clinicians and patients co-design the trial, knowing the exposures and their washout periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:47">[41:47]</a>.
*   Randomization further controls variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:12">[42:12]</a>.
*   Trials are often short (e.g., a few weeks) to ensure time series are fairly stationary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:16">[42:16]</a>.
*   Patient communication helps identify other impacting factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30">[42:30]</a>.

In real-world scenarios, dealing with non-stationarity is more complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:43">[42:43]</a>. Approaches include:
*   Formalizing variable definitions within a framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50">[42:50]</a>.
*   Using Markov chain-type processes or looking at latent states and transitions, though this might change the study question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:08">[43:08]</a>.
*   Stationarization, such as taking the first difference of the time series, also alters the study question to focus on derivatives/differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:39">[43:39]</a>.
*   Employing diagnostics in modeling to detect shifts in the time series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:09">[44:09]</a>.
*   Segmenting the time series into stationary periods using changepoint detection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:42">[44:42]</a>.

### Causal Inference Frameworks
While various frameworks exist, the speaker primarily uses the potential outcomes framework <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a> and leans heavily on [[Causal Inference in Single Subject Studies | Directed Acyclic Graphs (DAGs)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a>. DAGs are visually helpful for understanding causal pathways, especially in time series settings where recursive diagrams show arrows from the past to the present, aiding in model construction and identification of effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a>.

### Individual Treatment Effects Misnomer
The term "individual treatment effect" (ITE) or "individualized treatment effect" in the literature is often a misnomer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:46">[38:46]</a>. These usually refer to small group treatment effects or conditional average treatment effects, which are based on subgroups of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:54">[38:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:34">[39:34]</a>. A true individual treatment effect is a purely counterfactual quantity that cannot be observed directly at any single point in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:54">[39:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:15">[41:15]</a>. N of 1 trials adopt a "bottom-up" approach to this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:08">[39:08]</a>.

## Designing and Running N of 1 Studies

### Advice for Self-Experimentation
For individuals interested in running their own N of 1 experiments:
*   **Design Stage**: Focus on the specific question you want to answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>. Clearly specify the variables to collect, how they will be measured (e.g., passive sensors like Fitbit, daily diaries, lab values), and if it's feasible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Remember that "design trumps analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:00">[23:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:51">[59:51]</a>.
*   **Implementation Stage**: Consider practical limitations such as time, money, and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:47:00">[22:47:00]</a>.
*   **Analysis Stage**: The analysis should be informed by the study question and data collection methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:28:00">[23:28:00]</a>. Otherwise, poorly designed studies can lead to misleading conclusions ("garbage in, garbage out") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:38:00">[23:38:00]</a>.

## Resources and Software

*   **Stats of One Newsletter**: A resource focusing on statistical methods, data collection, and software related to N of 1 trials and single-case designs (used in psychology and education) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. It also draws from time series literature, functional data analysis, econometrics, and finance (where N of 1 trials are known as switchback experiments) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>.
*   **N of 1 Collaborative Network**: An Australian-based group that has been instrumental in popularizing the design and implementation of N of 1 trials for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:22:00">[17:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:16">[45:16]</a>. They also offer a consulting service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:29">[45:29]</a>.
*   **Software Ecosystem**:
    *   *Tummy Trials*: An early app for irritable bowel syndrome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:17:00">[24:17:00]</a>.
    *   *Migraine Buddy*: More for self-tracking, though less focused on self-experiment design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:39:00">[24:39:00]</a>.
    *   *Study Me*: A newer package developed by Stefan Konorski <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.

## Future Directions

Key areas for advancing the field of N of 1 trials include:
*   **Popularizing Design and Implementation**: Continued efforts, like those by the N of 1 Collaborative Network, to make these designs more widely known and used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:25">[45:25]</a>.
*   **Interdisciplinary Connections**: Connecting N of 1 trials and single-case designs with other fields, such as:
    *   **Functional Data Analysis**: Studying entire curves of data (e.g., step counts over a day) rather than just averages, to see how the curve differs under various conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:59">[45:59]</a>. This applies to outcomes like blood glucose or athletic performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:27">[46:27]</a>.
    *   **Control Theory and System Identification**: Exploring the connection between [[Optimal experimentation in causal studies | causal inference]] and engineering techniques to understand human behavior and optimize interventions to reach stable points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:57">[46:57]</a>. This is particularly timely given the rise of agentic systems and the need for reliable world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:50">[47:50]</a>.

## Journey into Statistics

Dr. Eric Daza, a trained concert pianist and researcher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>, initially studied neurobiology but found his passion in statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. This shift was inspired by family medical history and a love for theater and music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>. A cognitive studies course in undergrad, where he designed and analyzed his own experiment, sparked his interest in data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:06:00">[27:06:00]</a>.

His journey included a one-year Master's in applied statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:11:00">[28:11:00]</a>, followed by five years as a master's level biostatistician in pharma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:07:00">[29:07:00]</a>. His desire to understand the underlying statistical concepts led him to pursue a doctorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:20:00">[29:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:00">[29:44:00]</a>. He enrolled in a [[Causal Inference in Single Subject Studies | causal inference]] course taught by Mark van der Laan, which profoundly impacted his career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. His interest in N of 1 trials was further ignited by Professor Susan Murphy's work on dynamic treatment regimes and his loved one's experience with irritable bowel syndrome, a condition treatable with N of 1 trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. He also notes that being diagnosed with ADHD later in life helped explain his earlier challenges with focus and his problem-solving approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:57:00">[32:57:00]</a>.

## General Advice for Aspiring Scientists

For those starting in advanced fields like statistics, machine learning, or causality, the key advice is to "just start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:36">[51:36]</a>. Engage with data, begin coding, and work through the mathematical problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:22:00">[50:22:00]</a>. Break down large daunting tasks into smaller, manageable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:06:00">[51:06:00]</a>. These small successes accumulate, leading to significant progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:40:00">[50:40:00]</a>. Focus on defining the study question and identifying the necessary data variables, as this forms the root of good science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. This approach of deep questioning and critical assumption evaluation, typically taught in doctoral programs, is broadly applicable even to personal life challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:34">[01:00:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>.

Dr. Juan Orus, originally from Bogot√°, Colombia, embarked on a diverse academic and professional journey before becoming a leading advocate for causality in marketing in Berlin. His path highlights the challenges and advantages of moving from pure theoretical research to applied industry problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Academic Background

Orus completed his PhD in geometric analysis, a field that gained popularity as geometric deep learning emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Early in his academic career, he was drawn to physics, particularly particle physics, but his interest ultimately lay in the underlying geometry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He attended prestigious conferences in his field, initially aiming for an academic career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, but eventually realized that pure mathematics did not bring him happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Living as a student in Berlin, he appreciated the exposure to diverse universities, young people, and the city's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Despite attempts to leave, he remained due to Berlin's diversity and vibrancy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

His decision to leave academia stemmed from a realization that the impact of his research was very limited, and he spent five years engaging almost exclusively with other mathematicians, feeling disconnected from the "real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. A turning point came during a prestigious conference at the Fields Institute in Canada where, despite the academic prestige, he found himself unhappy and away from his family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Transition to Industry

In September 2016, close to finishing his PhD, Orus started contemplating his next steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He coincidentally bought a book titled "Data Science for Dummies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Through connections in Berlin, he met a former graduate school student who was working in data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Data science felt like the most interesting option for him, not due to hype, but because it offered a good field to apply his existing knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The transition, however, required him to start from scratch in understanding data problems from a business, rather than academic, perspective, which he described as "pretty tough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

## The Value of an Academic Foundation in Industry

Orus strongly believes that his background in pure mathematics was "absolutely" helpful in dealing with applied problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
His math training taught him how to solve problems, specifically to:
*   Break down hard problems into smaller, manageable pieces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   Avoid being overwhelmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   Not be afraid to tackle ill-defined problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

He emphasizes the importance of a strong foundation in fields like linear algebra, which he considers fundamental, as many industry problems can be reduced to linear algebra problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

His physics background also contributed by teaching him to model phenomena without over-complicating them. This means starting with the essence of a problem, building simple models, and then iteratively adding complexity while experimenting with data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. This approach encourages starting with minimal, strong assumptions and gradually refining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>.

Orus advocates for focusing on fundamentals like linear algebra and probability theory rather than chasing "hot" technologies that may fade out, such as Hadoop, which he never used despite its past hype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39">[00:41:39]</a>. He stresses that these foundational understandings provide the "backbone of the theories" and a wider range of applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:46">[00:41:46]</a>.

## Overcoming Challenges in the Transition

Orus acknowledges that entering a new field like data science or causality can be overwhelming and create anxiety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:39">[00:47:39]</a>. His advice for those starting out is to:
*   Focus on fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.
*   Solve concrete, interesting problems, even if they are personal projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:02">[00:48:02]</a>. He cites his own experience building a web scraper and analyzing public data on a Colombian referendum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:24">[00:48:24]</a>.
*   Break down problems into smaller pieces and celebrate progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.
*   Embrace the journey and maintain [[Interdisciplinary approaches in scientific research | curiosity]] and openness to learning new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.

The experience of successfully completing a personal project reinforced his belief in his abilities and boosted his motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:47">[00:49:47]</a>. This also highlights his approach to [[early_entrepreneurship_and_innovation_in_technology | early entrepreneurship and innovation in technology]].

His journey demonstrates that a non-linear career path, especially one from rigorous academic training, can be highly beneficial in applied fields by providing a robust problem-solving framework and a strong conceptual foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

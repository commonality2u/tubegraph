Understanding the distinction between identification and estimation is a key aspect of applying [[causal_inference_methods_and_applications | causal methods]] properly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:51"></a>. It is crucial for analysts to grasp this difference before applying new methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:09"></a>.

## Importance of the Distinction

A significant insight from the Coal AI conference highlights that while many valuable resources exist online for [[causal_inference_methods_and_applications | causal methods]], people sometimes apply a method without carefully considering its purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:57"></a>. It's essential to critically evaluate whether a method addresses [[Potential Outcomes and Causal Identification | identification]] or estimation, and if it assumes conditions like randomized treatment assignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:04"></a>. This careful approach is necessary to navigate the [[challenges_and_methodologies_in_causal_inference | challenges in causal analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:19"></a>.

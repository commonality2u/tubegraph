Scientific research is often a non-linear process driven by exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A key element of this exploration is the adoption of interdisciplinary approaches, which involve borrowing concepts and methods from various fields to combine them into new solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.

## Benefits of Interdisciplinary Research

Interdisciplinary research fosters creativity by amalgamating different expertises and personalities, leading to unique and innovative results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. It is crucial for solving complex real-life problems that involve practical constraints, such as those encountered in medical imaging or product development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.

Key advantages include:
*   **Challenging Assumptions** One of the most significant benefits is the ability to challenge underlying assumptions, particularly those that are often forgotten in single-discipline approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. By making assumptions explicit, different perspectives can discuss and challenge them, leading to more robust models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>.
*   **Comprehensive Problem Solving** Interdisciplinary thinking acknowledges that a problem is not solely about modeling or data, but involves many components, both stated and unstated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Developing Better Tools** In fields like medical imaging, interdisciplinary efforts focus on creating better tools to enhance the work of experts, rather than replacing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## Examples of Interdisciplinary Success

### Advanced Causal Inference Lab at Spotify
The Advanced [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | Causal Inference]] Lab at Spotify exemplifies an interdisciplinary approach, with its team members bringing diverse backgrounds:
*   **Engineering and Computer Science** focusing on medical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>
*   **Software Engineering and Reinforcement Learning** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>
*   **Astrophysics** (dealing with black holes) transitioning into data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>
*   **Quantum Physics** (dealing with quantum computing) moving into product-focused [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:44">[00:35:44]</a>

This "melting pot" of different people and personalities fosters creativity and unique results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>.

### SETI Institute Project
A project at the SETI Institute involved a diverse team of two machine learning specialists, two solar physicists, and one ionospheric physicist. Their collaborative effort aimed to predict problems in the ionosphere caused by solar weather, and it successfully worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

### Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works
Historically, Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works, their experimental division since the 1940s, cultivated a unique culture of small, diverse teams that could move fast and challenge conventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:46">[00:36:46]</a>.

### Music and Arts
The concept of combining different elements also extends to the arts, such as in music where artists from different genres (e.g., jazz, pop, sitar) collaborate to create fusion music, leading to beautiful outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.

### Resolving Conflicts in Physics
In physics, there have been instances where major proponents of conflicting views were encouraged to debate each other by supporting the opposing viewpoint. This approach led to a better understanding and increased collaboration, easing conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>.

## Challenges and Overcoming Them

One significant challenge is the inherent human inertia and resistance to change, making people susceptible to finding flaws in new approaches, even if those flaws exist in established methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Another is the difficulty in building bridges between different "tribes," whether scientific or cultural, especially when trust is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.

Overcoming these challenges requires an open mind and a willingness to explore new possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. When confronted with new ideas, people are often inventive and act as explorers at heart, pushing limits to find new things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:35">[00:52:35]</a>. Building bridges through collaboration, where people actively work together on shared tasks, is one of the best predictors for fostering understanding and trust between different groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>.

## The Role of [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | Causality]]

[[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | Causality]] is not limited to the modeling part of a system but is integrated into the entire system-building process, from data collection to making the product robust and serving the end customer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. In medical fields, thinking about data in a [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causal way]] can help build better datasets and address unobserved confounding elements that affect diagnoses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

While [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causal inference]] and discovery rely on assumptions, these assumptions are made explicit, allowing them to be tested, discussed, and challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This explicit assumption-making is a key difference from other modeling approaches where assumptions might be forgotten, leading to unforeseen problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.

The ability to understand [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causality]] is innate to humans, making it easier to develop products based on these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. This inherent understanding allows people to grasp the power of [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causal reasoning]], such as controlling for spurious correlations, even if initial convincing is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

Investing in [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causal discovery]] and education about [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causality]] would significantly benefit science and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>. By understanding how to identify spurious correlations and being skeptical, society can become more accurate and logical in its endeavors, reducing mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

[[causal AI and machine learning | Causal AI and machine learning]] is applicable across various industries, offering more than just predictions by providing actionable insights and business recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. It addresses the "why" behind phenomena, enabling "what-if" and counterfactual scenario analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Benefits Across Sectors

Stakeholders, including business experts and data scientists, often find that [[Causal AI and machine learning | causal AI]] "just makes sense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:27:00">[29:27:00]</a>. Its explainability and ability to reduce human biases are key advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.

### Supply Chain Management

[[industrial_applications_of_causal_inference | Causal machine learning]] is particularly valuable in complex supply chains, which are heavily affected by geopolitical issues, pandemics (like Corona), and semiconductor shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:17:00">[27:17:00]</a>. It helps companies make better, data-backed business decisions and provides recommendations beyond mere predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

Traditional statistical and machine learning solutions often fall short in supply chain management due to their "black box" nature and lack of explainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>. Managers need to understand what caused an issue and what the next steps should be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. [[Causal AI and machine learning | Causal machine learning]] addresses this by:
*   Providing explainable models through causal discovery graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   Enabling "what-if" simulations and future scenario planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   Building trust with management by incorporating their tribal knowledge into models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.
*   Assessing stress tests and time-to-recover capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:39:00">[42:39:00]</a>, which are crucial for supply chain resilience.

> The speaker's PhD work focused on applying [[Causal Machine Learning in Medicine and Industry | causal machine learning]] to supply chain problems, including predicting how external factors affect supplier backlogs, wrong deliveries, or special transports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. The Resist algorithm performed well in this context, generating causal discovery graphs very close to expert-derived ground truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:00">[16:18:00]</a>.

### Sports Industry

[[Causal AI applications in various industries | Causality]] can be applied in sports for:
*   **Root Cause Analysis:** Identifying the causes of athlete injuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:00">[26:20:00]</a>.
*   **Performance Prediction:** Running "what-if" simulations, such as analyzing the effect of increased sleep hours on a player's match performance (e.g., expected goals) or injury risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:26:00">[26:26:00]</a>. Understanding a player's status (injured or not) is a critical KPI in sports, as it can significantly impact a team's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>.

### Medicine

While not explicitly detailed as an application, the speaker, coming from a medical family background, highlights the potential of [[Causal Machine Learning in Medicine and Industry | causal machine learning]] in medicine, for example, predicting the early onset of diseases like cancer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:32:00">[58:32:00]</a>.

### Future Outlook and Integration with Generative AI

The potential for [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal AI]] is considered immense and not restricted to specific industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:00:00">[27:00:00]</a>. The future of dashboarding is seen as combining [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal AI]] with Large Language Models (LLMs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:33:00">[44:33:00]</a>. This integration aims to create intuitive systems where decision-makers can query impacts, such as:
*   Predicting an athlete's injury based on stress levels or family events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:46:00">[44:46:00]</a>.
*   Quantifying the impact of an event like a tsunami on specific suppliers in a supply chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:59:00">[44:59:00]</a>.

LLMs can significantly expedite the [[Causality and Machine Learning | causal discovery]] process by generating initial causal relationships and graphs, which experts can then validate and refine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>. This approach leverages the LLM's ability to quickly process information, reducing the time commitment from human experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:35:00">[21:35:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:04:00">[23:04:00]</a>.

> "Many people starting with causality they experience something that I call the fundamental fear of causality which is asking the question how do I know if my dag is correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:42:00">[29:42:00]</a>

The evaluation of [[Causal AI and its connection to machine learning | causal models]], particularly in scenarios without direct expert validation (e.g., predicting the impact of an alien attack), can involve:
*   Sensitivity analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:37:00">[45:37:00]</a>.
*   Partial identification strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:39:00">[45:39:00]</a>.
*   Iterative model building and comparison with observational or experimental data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>.
*   Leveraging Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) with LLMs to reduce hallucinations and consult existing documented expert knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:26:00">[47:26:00]</a>.
*   Optimal experimentation theory to minimize uncertainty through strategic interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:15:00">[48:15:00]</a>.
*   [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | Causal data fusion]] to combine experimental and observational data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:47:00">[48:47:00]</a>.

The role of human experts remains crucial in validating and refining [[Causality and Machine Learning | causal models]], making the process a collaborative effort to bridge the "trust deficit" often seen with traditional black-box models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:20:00">[24:20:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>.

Causality plays a crucial role in enabling artificial intelligence (AI) systems to transition from laboratory settings to real-world applications, particularly within industrial and manufacturing environments. Many enterprise AI projects, between 85% and 90% depending on the statistics, fail to make it outside the lab [05:59]. This is often because, while models may show incredible performance in controlled environments, they break down catastrophically when deployed in the field [06:12]. Additionally, human users may not trust these algorithms if they don't understand the underlying causal model [06:26].

## The Challenge with Traditional AI in Physical Systems
When attempting to model a physical system, such as a manufacturing process or a complex machine, traditional AI approaches like deep learning frequently encounter limitations [07:27]. These systems often involve "real parts connected to real parts," creating clear cause-and-effect relationships [07:52]. For example, in a manufacturing line, one component's movement directly causes another's [07:51].

One client, after initially trying to solve a manufacturing problem with deep learning, found that while it worked well in the lab, it failed catastrophically in the real world because the real-world conditions differed from the training data [08:18]. Even after working with six different deep learning companies, improvements in performance were insufficient, and senior leadership could not understand or explain the real-world connectivity of the machine [08:41]. This lack of explainability and robustness led them to nearly abandon AI altogether [09:16].

## The Causal AI Approach
The solution lay in adopting [[causality_in_ai | Causal AI]]. When the client's data scientist discovered and implemented [[causality_in_ai | Causal AI]], they gave it a final chance [09:21].

### Causal Discovery and Digital Twins
Automated causal discovery was performed on the collected data, which effectively created a "digital twin" of the machine [09:35]. This digital twin represented the true causal mechanisms of the physical system [09:42].

### Integration of Human Expertise
A key differentiator of the [[causality_in_ai | Causal AI]] approach is the involvement of human domain experts from the very beginning [10:33]. The proposed causal diagram, generated by the algorithm, was presented to the machine's domain experts [09:48]. These experts could then review and correct the model, identifying relationships that the algorithm might have missed due to a lack of observed faults in specific parts of the machine [10:00]. For instance, they could confirm that a certain cog was not causally connected to another, even if the algorithm didn't detect a link due to the absence of past failures in that specific part [10:09]. This iterative process, involving both algorithms and human knowledge, is fundamental to [[causality_in_ai | causal AI]] [10:26].

## Benefits of Causality in Industry
[[causality_in_ai | Causality]] helps address two fundamental challenges in deploying AI in the real world:
1.  **Ensuring real-world functionality**: Causal models are designed to understand underlying cause-and-effect mechanisms, making them more robust and generalizable to new, unseen conditions outside the lab [05:40].
2.  **Building human trust**: By providing explainable models that map to real-world phenomena, [[causality_in_ai | causality]] helps users understand and trust the AI's decisions and predictions [06:26]. This allows AI to move from the lab to the real world effectively [06:36].

Observing a child throwing a block or toy away might lead some [[parents_perceptions_of_childrens_behaviors | parents to interpret those behaviors as aggressive behaviors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. However, it turns out that most of the time, children throw things because it helps them learn about how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This active form of learning is one way in which [[childrens_learning_through_interaction | Children's learning]] differs significantly from how most [[experiments_and_ab_testing_in_machine_learning | machine learning systems]] learn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Purpose of Infant Experimentation

Children perform systematic experiments to learn the laws of physics and the rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This capability gives children a powerful toolkit for building effective world models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Key Research Findings

*   **Alison Gopnik:** American [[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | developmental psychologist]] Alison Gopnik has demonstrated that children perform systematic experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   **Amy S. Choi and Lisa Fenson:** Research by Amy S. Choi and Lisa Fenson from Johns Hopkins University shows that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects displaying unpredictable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. For example, they prefer toys that can pass through walls over more predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Benefits of Interactive Learning

Infants' ability to interact with the world not only makes their learning more robust compared to just observing the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, but it also informs them which hypothesis to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This leads to an interactive chain of hypotheses and tests aimed at falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Comparison to Machine Learning

The capability of infants to actively interact and experiment with their environment differentiates them from most contemporary [[experiments_and_ab_testing_in_machine_learning | machine learning systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Modern [[experiments_and_ab_testing_in_machine_learning | machine learning]] typically learns in a more static way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

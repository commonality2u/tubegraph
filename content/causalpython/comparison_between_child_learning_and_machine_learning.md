Children's learning processes often differ significantly from how most [[Causal AI and machine learning | machine learning systems]] operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## How Children Learn

Children engage in active experimentation to understand their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

*   **Active Experimentation**
    *   Toddlers throwing objects, for instance, often do so not out of aggression, but to learn how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
    *   Alison Gopnik, an American developmental psychologist, has demonstrated that children conduct systematic experiments to learn the laws of physics and the rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.
    *   Research by Amy Stahl and Lisa Feigenson from Johns Hopkins University indicates that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects that exhibit unpredictable properties (e.g., toys passing through walls) rather than predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

*   **Robustness and Hypothesis Testing**
    *   This ability to interact with the world makes children's learning more robust compared to simply observing their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
    *   It also helps children identify which hypotheses to test next, creating an interactive cycle of hypothesis formation and testing aimed at falsification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   This comprehensive approach equips children with a powerful toolkit for building [[developing_effective_machine_learning_models | effective world models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Differences from Machine Learning

The interactive and experimental nature of child learning contrasts with the typical learning methods of most contemporary [[Causal AI and machine learning | machine learning systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

*   **Static vs. Active Learning**
    *   Infants and children are distinguished from most [[Causal AI and machine learning | machine learning systems]] by their capacity for active interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   [[Active learning versus static learning | Machine learning systems]] typically learn in a more [[Active learning versus static learning | static way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
    *   The consequences of [[Active learning versus static learning | static learning]] versus a more [[Active learning versus static learning | active way]] of learning will be further discussed in subsequent videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

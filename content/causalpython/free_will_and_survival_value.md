Professor Judea Pearl believes that the "scandal of science" surrounding [[philosophical_perspectives_on_causality | free will]] will eventually be resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. He suggests that the [[philosophical_aspects_of_causality | illusion of free will]] possesses a significant survival value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:03">[02:07:03]</a>. If it didn't, humans would not have maintained this illusion for centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

## Computational Advantage of the Illusion

When intelligent machines are developed and applied across numerous environments, those that possess the "illusion of [[Counterfactual reasoning in decision making | free will]]" will likely survive and outperform others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This suggests that there is a computational advantage associated with this illusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Once this advantage is understood, it can be programmed into artificial intelligence systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

The future may see computer systems that act *as though* they possess [[Causal decision making and reinforcement learning | free will]], even though they are merely neural firings and do not genuinely have it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. These systems will also be able to understand human discussions about [[Counterfactual reasoning in decision making | free will]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

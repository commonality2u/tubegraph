Scott Muller, a guest on the Causal Bandits podcast, dedicates his work to making better decisions, both at an individual level and for effective population policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:17">[03:30:17]</a>. His research deeply involves [[causal_inference_concepts_and_applications | counterfactual reasoning]], which addresses the fundamental problem of [[causal_inference_and_its_applications | causal inference]] where observing outcomes for different treatments simultaneously is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:16">[03:46:16]</a>.

## The Fundamental Problem of Causal Inference
The core challenge in [[causal_inference_and_its_applications | causal inference]] is that one cannot observe the outcomes for two different treatments on the same individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:30">[03:51:30]</a>. For instance, it's impossible to see a person take medicine, then go back in time, have them *not* take the medicine, and observe what happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:16">[03:59:16]</a>. While this can be estimated at a population level through averages or randomized controlled trials, it is difficult to obtain point estimates or identify specific counterfactual probabilities at an individual level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:03">[04:09:03]</a>.

### Bounds on Counterfactual Probabilities
Jin Tian and Judea Pearl developed bounds on probabilities of causation, particularly for counterfactual probabilities like probability of necessity, probability of sufficiency, and probability of necessity and sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:39">[04:31:39]</a>. While these bounds are mathematically tight, meaning they cannot be improved without further assumptions, they are often too loose to be useful for making decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:24">[04:51:24]</a>. The challenge then becomes how to narrow these bounds, ideally to the point where they become identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:11">[05:14:11]</a>. This requires making additional, reasonable assumptions that make sense for a particular scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:03">[05:44:03]</a>.

### The Monotonicity Assumption
One such helpful assumption, as demonstrated in Scott Muller's papers, is monotonicity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:05">[06:07:05]</a>.
*   **Definition**: Monotonicity assumes there is no possibility of harm in a counterfactual sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:28">[06:17:28]</a>. For example, if taking a medicine prevents one from getting better, but not taking it would have led to recovery, that constitutes harm. Monotonicity asserts that such a negative counterfactual effect is impossible (probability of it happening is zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:01">[06:26:01]</a>. This can be known from the underlying biological mechanisms in some cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:47">[07:09:47]</a>.
*   **Usefulness**: When monotonicity is assumed, it allows for the point identification of various counterfactual probabilities, such as the probability of benefit or the probability of necessity and sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:04">[07:21:04]</a>.
*   **Challenges in Practice**:
    *   Knowing when monotonicity holds is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:08">[08:04:08]</a>.
    *   Scott Muller, along with Judea Pearl, is working on a paper showing that while it's rare to confirm monotonicity from data alone, it is often much more feasible to show definitively that monotonicity does *not* hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:24">[08:41:24]</a>.
    *   Even when monotonicity is violated, understanding the limits of that violation can help narrow the counterfactual bounds further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:09">[09:38:09]</a>. This is akin to "putting a bound on the bound" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:03">[10:06:03]</a>.

## Bridging Theory and Practice: Software and Applications
Scott Muller, with a background in software development, aims to make his [[causal_inference_methods_and_applications | causal inference methods and applications]] more accessible to practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:44">[15:26:44]</a>. He plans to develop applications and software frameworks, including contributing to open-source libraries like DoWhy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:35">[15:30:35]</a>. DoWhy is praised for its consistent API, similar to scikit-learn, which makes [[causal_inference_methods_and_applications | causal inference methods and applications]] easier for users without needing to implement everything from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:40">[16:21:40]</a>.

Muller also envisions building user-friendly interfaces, such as graphical user interfaces (GUIs) or integrations into existing popular software packages, that allow domain experts (e.g., in econometrics, biology, or marketing) to leverage [[causal_inference_concepts_and_applications | causal inference concepts and applications]] without extensive coding knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:38:19">[17:38:19]</a>.

### [[causality_in_marketing_and_decisionmaking | Causality in Marketing]]: The Unit Selection Framework
One significant area where [[causal_inference_and_its_applications | causal inference]] can provide substantial value is marketing. Scott highlights the unit selection framework, developed by Ang Li and Judea Pearl, as a powerful alternative to traditional A/B testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:22:04">[19:22:04]</a>.

*   **Critique of A/B Testing**: While A/B testing is widely used in internet marketing to identify ads that perform better on average, it can be severely suboptimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:04">[19:57:04]</a>.
*   **Unit Selection Framework**: This framework allows marketers to specify the value or weight they place on four different types of responders in a marketing campaign (where treatment is showing an ad, and response is buying a product) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a>:
    1.  **Compliers**: Buy the product if shown the ad, but not if they don't see it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:41">[21:50:41]</a>. These are the desired target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:54:19">[22:54:19]</a>.
    2.  **Always Takers**: Buy the product whether or not they see the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>.
    3.  **Never Takers**: Do not buy the product whether or not they see the ad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:07:37">[22:07:37]</a>.
    4.  **Defiers**: Do not buy the product if they see the ad, but would buy it if they don't see it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:00">[22:13:00]</a>. These are the ones to avoid advertising to, as the ad actively deters them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:08">[22:43:08]</a>.
*   **Value-Based Decisions**: By assigning values (positive, zero, or negative) to each responder type and leveraging observational and experimental data, the framework provides bounds on the overall value of advertising to a specific subpopulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:30">[25:51:30]</a>. This allows for more optimal decisions beyond simple average performance, even if individual counterfactual effects cannot be identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:12">[25:09:12]</a>.

## A Journey to Causality
Scott Muller's path to [[causal_inference_and_its_applications | causal inference]] was unconventional. He initially studied computer science, then ventured into the tech world as a software developer, and later founded several successful businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:56:06">[26:56:06]</a>. Despite business successes, a "nagging desire" to return to academia and research persisted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:13:17">[31:13:17]</a>. The rise of AI and the dream of Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) further motivated his return to school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:46:00">[32:46:00]</a>.

A pivotal moment was reading Judea Pearl's "Book of Why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:41:00">[34:41:00]</a>. This book made him realize his own limitations in interpreting data and making decisions based on it, leading him to understand the [[importance_of_understanding_causal_inference_for_decision_making | importance of understanding causal inference for decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:12:00">[37:12:00]</a>. He concluded that [[causal_reasoning_in_decisionmaking | thinking causally and counterfactually]] is fundamental to human reasoning, evident even in babies, and is a core component that needs to be "baked into" machine learning models for achieving human-level AI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:55:09">[37:55:09]</a>.

## Causality and the Future of AI
Scott believes that the mathematics and science behind [[causal_inference_and_its_applications | causality]] need to be integrated into AI architectures to achieve more intelligent agents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:33:00">[40:33:00]</a>. He doubts that scaling up current models (like LLMs) alone will lead to the emergence of causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:41:00">[39:41:00]</a>. His current research continues to focus on identifying or narrowing bounds on counterfactual probabilities to enable better decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:09">[42:49:09]</a>.

## Advice for Navigating Challenges
For those starting something challenging or complex, whether in [[causal_inference_and_its_applications | causality]], machine learning, or business, Scott emphasizes the crucial decision of knowing when to persevere and when to be "derailed" because one is heading in a wrong direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:46:17">[51:46:17]</a>. His advice for making such decisions is to "learn [[causal_reasoning_in_decisionmaking | counterfactual analysis]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:03:00">[53:03:00]</a>. In academia, hard problems are seen as interesting puzzles, and he believes that if a solution is possible, he will find it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:13:10">[55:13:10]</a>.

The following article summarizes insights and challenges regarding [[application_of_causal_ai_in_marketing_and_business | Causal AI in business applications]], as discussed at the Causal AI Conference 2024 in London.

## Causal AI in Business Applications

The Causal AI Conference 2024 in London was characterized by incredible energy, a willingness to share and learn, and a significant amount of inspiration, reminiscent of deep learning and machine learning events in 2014-2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Attendees found the sessions intriguing and interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Key Insights and Value Propositions
*   **Widespread Appreciation**: [[Causal methods are appreciated and explored across industries]] from many different sectors, showing lots of excitement for various types of causal inquiry, including interventions and counterfactuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Diverse Problem-Solving Approaches**: The conference highlighted how different companies tackle similar problems, emphasizing both technical and business aspects of posing questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Understanding "Why"**: A central theme was the underlying question of "why things happened," with diverse sectors like music, travel, and banking exploring this through [[causal_reasoning_in_artificial_intelligence | Causal AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
*   **Addressing Machine Learning Limitations**: [[Causal AI is doing a great job at addressing critical limitations of classical machine learning models]], such as providing directional flows and feature importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. It contributes significantly to explainable AI, making it easier for stakeholders to understand and trust decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing Causation from Correlation**: [[Causal AI helps differentiate correlation from causation]], which is a fundamental goal for many data scientists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Discovering Truth Beyond Traditional ML**: Finding the true relationships and directions in data requires [[causal_reasoning_in_ai | causal inference]] because traditional [[machine_learning_versus_causal_models_in_business | machine learning]] can be hindered by confounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Practical Application Ideas**: Attendees gained ideas on how various companies approach [[causality_in_ai | causality]] and how to implement these insights, including counterfactual reasoning, within their own organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Challenges in Business Application
Several challenges were identified in applying [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | Causal AI]] in a business context:

*   **Organizational Adoption**:
    *   Starting a [[causal approach within a company]] and effectively integrating useful knowledge to address product questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   While [[Causal AI is intellectually interesting, it requires cognitive effort for stakeholders]] to grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
    *   Getting everyone on board to understand causal methods properly can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   Convincing business people about the importance of advanced analytics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   Grasping the value of answering problems causally and getting business stakeholders to embrace this requires careful communication and analogies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **Communication and Understanding**:
    *   [[Communication is key]] throughout the process, from problem understanding and setting to modeling and transmitting knowledge to stakeholders, bridging technical and non-technical backgrounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    *   [[Understanding a specific problem and the factors at play]] is always a challenge, as each new problem comes with different settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
    *   [[Transmitting insights and asking the proper questions]] to unlock problems is considered the most difficult part, with no prescribed way of doing it due to case-by-case variations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   Bridging the gap between external advancements and internal implementation within a bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   Explaining [[AI]] in a way that complements existing operations without substituting them, while being technical enough for clients to trust but not overwhelming them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Matching [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | Causal AI]] insights with business intuition and integrating business insights into causal AI results, as well as presenting these results to business teams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

*   **Technical and Methodological**:
    *   Defining the scope and boundaries of a causal analysis, deciding which factors to include in a causal diagram, and determining the appropriate level of detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   Distinguishing between identification and estimation in [[causal_ai_and_its_application_in_different_sciences | causal methods]] and being careful about method assumptions (e.g., randomized treatment assignment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
    *   The dynamism of causal graphs over time, as nothing is truly stationary or static, is a theoretical challenge that requires further research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   Determining the finite number of informative counterfactual questions for a specific scenario before additional "what if" questions cease to provide new insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   Keeping up with the constant change in the data science and AI industry, learning new models, understanding their assumptions, and comparing or combining them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Approaching problems where [[causal effect estimation]] is needed, but the positivity assumption is broken, especially when domain knowledge is limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   Ensuring that causal graphs are truly accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> and that estimated treatment effects are correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.
    *   Addressing cannibalization and interference in e-commerce, and how to account for these in modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
    *   Balancing interpretability with accuracy in marketing, as historically, many marketing mix models (MMM) have gone unused due to this challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
    *   Answering complex marketing questions like incrementality ("what if I had not done marketing?") or the long-term effectiveness of brand marketing and its impact on performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.
    *   Understanding the uncertainty in predictions from a causal graph for a target of interest, especially when the ground truth is unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.

*   **Resource Constraints**:
    *   Having the necessary resources (tools and people) to answer all pressing questions, as [[causal_ai_in_medicine | Causal AI]] offers breakthrough potential but is currently limited by available resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

### Causal Questions to be Addressed

Alexander Den, a guest on the Causal Bandits podcast, transitioned from pursuing a PhD in Super String Theory to a career in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. This move was part of a larger trend of individuals with strong mathematical and scientific backgrounds entering the financial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Motivation for the Career Change

Den's decision to leave theoretical physics stemmed from a perception of stagnation in the field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. While physics is fundamentally about finding connections between mathematics and the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, he felt that Super String Theory had moved too far from this practical, experimental direction, betraying the spirit of physics he had been raised with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. He desired to return to something tangible that he could "see," "feel," and "understand" in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. Major breakthroughs in theoretical physics, according to Den, largely occurred in the 1970s, with subsequent work being follow-up experimentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This led to a feeling of stagnation and disappointment among many in academia, prompting them to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

In contrast, Den observed significant growth and utility in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. He was surprised to discover how much finance, which he initially considered "boring and very political," could benefit from mathematics and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Transferable Skills and Early Finance Experience

Den found that his academic background in physics provided a strong foundation of mathematics and statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The most useful mathematical tools he carried over included:
*   Basic statistics and probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>
*   [[stochastic_processes_and_financial_modeling | Stochastic processes]] and stochastic differential equations, which were well-covered in his physics programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   Pattern recognition and the early seeds of machine learning, gained from laboratory work in physics where observations were used to make sense and decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These skills translated naturally to financial applications like statistical classification and regression models for credit applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

His entry into finance was serendipitous, joining a friend's financial micro credit company at the beginning of the 21st century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. In this role, he quickly identified the strong connections between physics principles and financial requirements, particularly in calculating risk based on behavioral patterns from newly available archived data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. This transition allowed him to leverage his existing knowledge and preparation in statistics and mathematics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

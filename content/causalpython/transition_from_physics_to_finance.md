Alexander Den, a guest on the Causal Bandits podcast, transitioned from pursuing a PhD in Superstring Theory to a career in finance. This shift was motivated by a desire to apply his strong theoretical background to practical, real-world problems and an observation of the contrasting growth trajectories in both fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>.

## From Abstract Theory to Real-World Application

Den's initial academic path led him to Superstring Theory, an advanced field in physics. However, he found that while studying physics teaches practicality, mathematics, statistics, and experimentation, Superstring Theory had moved too far from the empirical and experimental spirit of physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. He felt a need to return to something tangible that he could "see, feel, understand, and relate to in the real world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>. This disillusionment with the lack of experimental verifiability and perceived stagnation in theoretical physics, where major breakthroughs occurred decades ago, prompted him to seek a different path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:09">[04:09:09]</a>.

Equipped with a solid background in mathematics and statistics, Den joined a growing wave of individuals with similar motivations who were transitioning into finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>. His entry into finance was somewhat by chance, as he joined a financial micro-credit company run by a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. He was surprised to discover that finance, which he had previously considered "boring and also very political," could greatly benefit from mathematical and statistical applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:49">[02:49:49]</a>.

## Leveraging Physics Skills in Finance

The skills acquired during his physics studies proved highly transferable and beneficial in his new finance career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:31">[03:31:31]</a>. Key mathematical and statistical tools he found most useful include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:03">[05:03:03]</a>:

*   **Basic Statistics and Probability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:12">[05:12:12]</a>
*   **Stochastic Processes and Stochastic Differential Equations**: These were particularly crucial for derivative pricing, a significant area in finance at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:17">[05:17:17]</a>.
*   **Pattern Recognition**: Experience in physics laboratories involved building pattern recognition tools to make sense of observations and inform decisions, a skill directly applicable to analyzing financial data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:35">[05:35:35]</a>.
*   **Statistical Classification and Regression Models**: Essential for applications like credit modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:50">[05:50:50]</a>.

In finance, Den observed a growing need to calculate risk based on behavioral patterns, which involved analyzing and archiving large datasets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:12">[03:12:12]</a>. This environment allowed him to build on his existing academic preparations, finding a clear utility for his skills in a field that offered significant growth opportunities, unlike the stagnation he perceived in theoretical physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:44">[03:44:44]</a>.

## The Challenge of Causality in Finance

One significant realization in his new career was the fundamental difference between experimental sciences like physics and fields like economics and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:57">[06:57:57]</a>. In physics, experiments can be conducted in controlled environments, repeated numerous times, and statistical conclusions drawn. However, economics is "messy" and not easily falsifiable, making traditional statistical repeatability difficult due to uncontrollable external factors and constantly changing contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:18">[07:18:18]</a>. This challenge of establishing stable data-generating processes without interventions became evident during the 2008 financial crisis, highlighting the limitations of relying on historical data and traditional risk measures like Value at Risk (VaR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:35">[08:35:35]</a>. This led him to explore [[integration_of_causality_in_economic_modeling | causal inference in finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:38">[06:38:38]</a>.

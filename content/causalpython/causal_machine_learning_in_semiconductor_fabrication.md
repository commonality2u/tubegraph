[[Machine learning and causality | Causal machine learning]] has demonstrated a significant impact in various industrial settings, including semiconductor fabrication, by enabling improved decision-making and process optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">00:10:11</a>. This application moves beyond traditional predictive models to understand the direct cause-and-effect relationships necessary for real-world interventions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">00:11:31</a>.

## Application at ABB Hitachi

A rigorous field experiment conducted by researchers from ETH Zurich in collaboration with ABB Hitachi showcased the practical utility of [[Machine learning and causality | causal machine learning]] in semiconductor fabrication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">00:00:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">00:14:43</a>.

### Objective and Methodology

The primary goal was to implement a [[Machine learning and causality | causal machine learning]] tool to identify and recommend actions that would reduce low quality in semiconductor fabrication processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">00:14:50</a>. This involved framing the problem as a [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal inference]] task, addressing how specific changes in manufacturing processes could improve average quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">00:14:59</a>. The approach aimed to augment human decision-makers rather than replace them, empowering editors to make better choices based on the algorithms' insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">00:15:28</a>.

### Achieved Results

The field experiment demonstrated that the [[Machine learning and causality | causal machine learning]] tool could reduce yield loss in semiconductor fabrication by almost 50% (specifically 49%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">00:00:07</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:10">00:16:10</a>. This significant improvement was achieved over a four-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">00:16:30</a>. The success of this application highlights the potential of [[Machine learning and causality | causal machine learning]] to drive real-world outcomes and create substantial financial gains in industrial processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">00:13:00</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">00:16:23</a>.

The application of [[Machine learning and causality | causal machine learning]] in semiconductor manufacturing underscores the importance of rigorous field experiments to demonstrate real-world [[Impact of causal machine learning beyond academia | impact beyond academia]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">00:15:59</a>. Similar applications have also been developed by startups like EthzAI, which focuses on using [[Machine learning and causality | causal machine learning]] to improve manufacturing processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:17">00:29:17</a>.

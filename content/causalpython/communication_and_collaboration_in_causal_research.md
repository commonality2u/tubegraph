The Coal AI conference 2024 in London was characterized by "incredible energy and incredible willingness to share and to learn from each other," providing significant inspiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. A recurring theme and challenge highlighted by attendees is the paramount importance of effective communication and collaboration in the practical application of [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal methods]].

## The Centrality of Communication

Communication is deemed essential across all phases of [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal analysis]], from problem understanding to modeling and knowledge transmission to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. According to one attendee, communication is "key" to understanding everything from the problem's onset to modeling and transmitting knowledge to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It's crucial to communicate with various stakeholders, including the team and experts, at their respective levels, whether technical or non-technical, to achieve success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

Investing in communication and understanding between people is described as the foundation for project success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Challenges in Communicating Causal Insights

Several challenges were identified regarding communication and collaboration within the domain of [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal analysis]]:

*   **Bridging Knowledge Gaps**
    *   A significant challenge is introducing a [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal approach]] within a company and effectively applying useful knowledge to address product questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   It requires addressing the "cognitive effort" for stakeholders to grasp these concepts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Getting everyone on board to properly understand [[challenges_and_methodologies_in_causal_inference | causal methods]] can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Transmitting Value and Insights**
    *   A key difficulty lies in transmitting insights and asking the right questions that unlock a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. There is no prescribed way, as each case differs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
    *   It's important to help business stakeholders "grasp the value of answering them properly in a causal way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Using analogies can help people understand and "reap the benefits of [[tools_and_frameworks_for_causal_analysis | causal methods]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Convincing business people about the importance of advanced analytics is a significant challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Balancing Technicality and Understanding**
    *   When presenting AI and causal models to clients, the challenge is to be "technical enough so that people can trust it," without being "too technical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
    *   One of the critical limitations that [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal AI]] addresses is its contribution to "explainable AI," which makes it easier to communicate with stakeholders and justify decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Integrating Internal and External Knowledge**
    *   Bringing external visions and new ideas from conferences into a company's internal testing environment can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
    *   A senior data scientist at Sephora noted the challenge of "matching the [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal AI]] insights with the business intuition" and integrating business insight into [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal AI]] results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:59">[00:19:59]</a>.

## Benefits of Effective Communication

Effective communication can transform a "failed project to a successful project" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It enables easier discussions with stakeholders, allowing teams to explain why certain directions or options are chosen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>. The ability to differentiate causation from correlation is a key benefit data scientists seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

### Practical Implications

Companies tackle similar problems in various ways, and seeing diverse approaches, both technical and business-oriented, offers new ideas for problem-solving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This exchange of ideas is considered a key benefit of conferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. The energy and enthusiasm among people working on [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal inference]] were highlighted as inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.

> <p class="quote-text">"It's very simple to say what if something had happened in a different way that it actually happened but contextualizing this makes it way more approachable and it also gives you new ideas of how to solve your problems as well."</p> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

The continuous effort to communicate the potential of [[Causal Discovery and Analysis | causal inference]] is vital, as it offers "breakthrough stuff" but is currently limited by available [[tools_and_frameworks_for_causal_analysis | tools]] and human resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

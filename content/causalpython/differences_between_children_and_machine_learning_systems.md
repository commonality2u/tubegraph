Children's learning processes often differ significantly from those of most contemporary [[machine_learning_and_causality | machine learning systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

## Active Experimentation vs. Static Learning
Children engage in active experimentation to understand their environment. For instance, a child might throw a block or toy, not out of aggression, but because it helps them learn how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>.

[[developmental_psychology_and_child_learning | Developmental psychologist]] Alison Gopnik has shown that children perform systematic experiments to learn the laws of physics and the rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. Research by Amy St. and Lisa Fenson from Johns Hopkins University indicates that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects displaying unpredictable properties (e.g., toys that pass through walls) over predictable ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.

In contrast, most contemporary [[machine_learning_and_causality | machine learning systems]] typically learn in a more static way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Robustness of Learning
Infants' ability to interact with the world makes their learning more robust compared to merely observing the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. This interactive approach helps them determine which hypotheses to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

## Hypothesis Testing and World Models
Children create an interactive chain of hypotheses and tests aimed at falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This capability provides children with a powerful toolkit for building effective models of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This active, experimental learning style distinguishes infants and children from the more static learning typical of contemporary [[machine_learning_and_causality | machine learning systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

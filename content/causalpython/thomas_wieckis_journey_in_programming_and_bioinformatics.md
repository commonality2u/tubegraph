Dr. Thomas Wiecki, a prominent figure in the field of causality and machine learning, shared insights into his journey from early programming fascination to developing leading probabilistic programming frameworks like PyMC. His path has been driven by a desire to create, solve problems, and foster community within data science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

## Early Life and Programming
Wiecki's interest in programming began as a child, where he learned by modifying code examples from a book given to him by his uncle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This early experience sparked a fascination with the idea of creating something from nothing and controlling systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Beyond his technical pursuits, he also played guitar in a metal band <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Academic Pursuits
His academic journey led him to study [[approaches_for_studying_intelligence_in_biological_systems | bioinformatics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. It was during this time that he "fell in love with Bayesian modeling," a passion that inspired him to develop one of the most recognizable Python [[advancements_in_probabilistic_programming_and_causal_discovery | probabilistic programming frameworks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His interest in neuroscience also played a role in his path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

He found Bayesian modeling to be incredibly versatile, using it not only in his PhD research but also in a job at a fintech startup called Quantopian, which focused on building a crowdsourced hedge fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The same tools used in academia proved effective for problems like portfolio construction and algorithm evaluation in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This experience solidified his belief that Bayesian modeling was useful for industry problems and many data science challenges requiring deep understanding and the incorporation of that understanding into models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Transition to Industry
Wiecki's [[transition_from_academia_to_industry | transition from academia to industry]] was a calculated risk. He weighed the probabilities of a career in academia versus industry, ultimately deciding that the skills gained during his PhD would be beneficial for an industry career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:35">[00:58:35]</a>. He consciously built programming skills and engaged with the community by attending conferences and doing internships, such as at Quantopian, which led to his first industry job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>. He also highlighted the differing company cultures, noting that his experience at Quantopian, under CEO Fawce and manager Jess, taught him about transparent, low-hierarchy environments where trust in people is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

## The Power of Community and Open Source
Beyond the technical aspects, Wiecki expressed immense enjoyment in the community aspect of his work, particularly in open source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. He finds it rewarding when people from across the world contribute significantly to projects like PyMC, leading to new friendships and a strong sense of community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Working with driven and talented individuals at PyMC Labs, solving advanced problems and pushing boundaries, is endlessly motivating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

He sees his work as a form of modern exploration, enabling humanity to do things previously impossible and solve massive problems like climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The widespread use of PyMC, with over 2,000 citations in diverse fields like astrophysics, demonstrates its real-world impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Causal Models and Bayesian Frameworks
Wiecki has been instrumental in integrating causal inference into the Bayesian framework, notably through the addition of a causal do-operator in PyMC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. He notes that while Bayesian and causal inference fields developed independently, there are interesting cross-connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. He credits Ben Vincent and Ricardo V in the implementation of the do-operator, which allows PyMC to tackle structural causal problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

He observed that structural thinking is fundamental to both [[advancements_in_probabilistic_programming_and_causal_discovery | probabilistic programming]] and causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Initially, he questioned the difference between models built in a Bayesian framework (which he termed the "data generative process") and structural causal models, finding that many experts didn't know the answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. He now concludes that "those two things are the same just to a different lens through a different framework" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. While causal inference often uses a frequentist framework, Wiecki sees immense value in expressing these ideas within a Bayesian context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Wiecki advocates for explaining the value of Bayesian modeling by focusing on causality, as it resonates intuitively with many people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. The ultimate purpose of data science, in his view, is to "make better actions" and "make better decisions," which requires understanding "what causes what" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

### Overcoming the Fear of Being Wrong
Addressing concerns about explicitly defining a structural model and the fear of being wrong, Wiecki stated:

> "I would say that it's great to be wrong. We're wrong all the time, and that's how we learn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:5:02">[01:5:02]</a>.

He emphasizes using tools like posterior predictive checks to identify errors and learn from them, which leads to a deeper understanding of the data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. This process also fosters communication with domain experts, whose insights are crucial for refining models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. He argues that the alternative—training black-box classifiers without understanding—is problematic because it prevents learning and effective communication of solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>.

### The Role of Generative Models and Uncertainty
Wiecki highlights that Bayesian models, being generative, are powerful tools for understanding problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. By building a causal structure and generating data, one can immediately see if the model behaves as expected, aiding in [[causal_discovery_algorithms_and_realworld_applications | structural discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:09">[00:38:09]</a>. He notes that this iterative approach, often incorporating expert knowledge, is similar to how [[causal_discovery_algorithms_and_realworld_applications | causal discovery algorithms]] are used in real-world settings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

He also discussed the significance of uncertainty quantification. While other methods like conformal prediction offer total uncertainty, the Bayesian framework allows for a natural and organic estimation of uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:26">[00:44:26]</a>. He places uncertainty quantification on a separate axis from model understandability or actionability, stating that different tools are needed for different problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:39">[00:45:39]</a>.

In practice, uncertainty estimates in PyMC are used to compare different scenarios or marketing channels, allowing for more informed decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>. By integrating uncertainty into an optimizer, models can make allocation decisions that account for risk, mirroring human risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>.

## Personal Philosophy and Advice
Wiecki offers several pieces of advice for those venturing into new fields like machine learning or Bayesian modeling:
*   **Follow your passion**: He pursued what he found enjoyable, which kept him motivated through challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>.
*   **Take calculated risks**: Assess the up and downside of decisions, protecting the downside. This guided his [[transition_from_academia_to_industry | transition from academia to industry]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>. Even with starting PyMC Labs, he avoided VC funding and loans, minimizing personal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:10">[01:00:10]</a>.
*   **Be open to exploration**: Give yourself the chance to explore areas outside your current focus, as you might discover new passions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:02">[01:02:02]</a>.
*   **Reach out to people**: Many opportunities arose from sending "random emails" to individuals whose work he admired, finding that people are often open and helpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:30">[00:59:30]</a>.
*   **Be realistic**: Don't overcommit to something that isn't working out; sometimes, it's time to try something new <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.

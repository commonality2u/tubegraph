Calends was founded around 2017 when [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | causal AI]] was a very niche topic, making the early experience of establishing the community feel "very lonely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Despite this, there was a belief from day one that the field would become significant, leading to efforts to lay foundational support for the community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. By 2023, the community was growing exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Contrarian Bet on Causal AI

The decision to focus on [[Causal AI and its connection to machine learning | causal AI]] was a "contrarian bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. The co-founders, including a computer scientist and a physicist, came from the hedge fund world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

At the time, the world was highly enthusiastic about deep learning, especially after AlphaGo beat the world champion at Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Many AI researchers were pivoting their focus to deep learning, believing it would solve everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

However, the co-founders held a contrarian view: deep learning is effective in specific, fixed-rule situations like board games, but less so in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Their experience in hedge funds showed that relying solely on historical patterns and correlations could lead to trouble, as the past rarely repeats in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The hedge fund environment taught them that significant success comes from taking a contrarian, yet correct, view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. For them, [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | causal AI]] proved to be that contrarian and correct bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The two key lessons from the hedge fund experience were:
1.  Real-world patterns change rapidly, and the past is not necessarily predictive of the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.
2.  The importance of taking a calculated, contrarian bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Bridging the Gap: From Lab to Real World

During a PhD in computer vision, focusing on biometrics, various approaches including deep learning and model-based methods were tried <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Deep learning performed exceptionally well in controlled lab environments where backgrounds and conditions were consistent, improving with more data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, when deployed in the real world, it failed catastrophically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

A model-based approach, which involved understanding the underlying structure (e.g., how body parts move or the 3D shape of a head), showed slightly worse performance in the lab but retained its performance and generalized much better in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

This experience highlighted a fundamental problem: without a model and understanding of cause-and-effect mechanisms, AI performs well in the lab but fails in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Today, 85-90% of enterprise AI projects never make it out of the lab due to this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Projects either fail to deliver or are not trusted by human users because the underlying causal model is not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. [[Causality and AI Challenges and Opportunities | Causality]] helps solve these two fundamental problems: ensuring AI works in the real world and is trusted by humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

## Causal AI Applications in Business and Technology

A concrete example of [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal AI applications]] involves modeling a physical system, such as a manufacturing process or a device within a machine, which inherently possesses true cause-and-effect mechanisms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

One client initially attempted to solve a problem with deep learning, investing significant data, and while it worked well in the lab, it failed catastrophically in the real world due to differences in conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Even after working with six deep learning companies, performance improved, but senior leadership lacked understanding and couldn't explain the real-world connectivity of the machine (e.g., how one cog moving causes another to move) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This led them to nearly abandon AI entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

Upon trying [[causal_ai_and_its_connection_to_machine_learning | causal AI]], automated causal discovery was applied to the data, creating a "digital twin" of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The proposed causal diagram was then presented to human domain experts, who could validate and even correct links based on their deep understanding, such as recognizing a causal link that the algorithm missed due to a lack of observed faults in that part of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This iterative process, involving human experts from the very beginning, distinguishes [[challenges_and_advancements_in_causal_ai | causal AI]] from deep learning and [[generative_ai_and_causal_models | Generative AI]], where models are often built by simply throwing data at them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## The Future: Combining Generative AI and Causal Models

While [[generative_ai_and_causal_models | Generative AI]] is excellent for certain applications and [[Generative AI and Causal Models | Causal Models]] for others, their combination holds significant, unexploited potential, where "1 + 1 equals 3" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:40">[00:19:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:46">[00:19:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>. These two technologies are considered great building blocks for the future of intelligent systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:01">[00:20:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

A major current gap is the lack of harmonization and unified interfaces for [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | causal AI]] packages, similar to what Scikit-learn offers for traditional machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:36">[00:21:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>. Open-sourcing interfaces and fostering community adoption will be crucial for the widespread adoption of [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | causal AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:04">[00:22:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:17">[00:22:17]</a>.

### Advice for Newcomers to Causal AI

For those starting in [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | causal AI]], it is now much more accessible than in 2017, with books and open-source packages available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Key advice includes:

Professor Stefan Feuerriegel, head of the Institute for AI and Management at LMU, emphasizes the critical need to translate complex AI algorithms, particularly [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal machine learning]], into practical applications for various industries. His career has seen him transition from computer science to AI and management, driven by a desire to make a distinctive impact in practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.

## The Importance of Impact and Practical Application
Feuerriegel highlights that the primary driver for his research in [[Causality and AI Challenges and Opportunities | causal machine learning]] is the potential for profound impact on people's lives, especially in medicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The goal is to move beyond abstract thought exercises and truly improve decision-making by developing, implementing, and evaluating new AI algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

## Bridging the Gap: Challenges and Strategies

### The Translation Challenge
A significant challenge in integrating AI, particularly causal machine learning, into daily operations is the communication gap between AI researchers and practitioners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Medical Professionals:** They have full schedules and are trained in medical content, not necessarily in statistics, mathematics, or computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Expecting them to understand complex statistical concepts like S-learners or T-learners is "almost impossible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Complex Concepts:** Causality and [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal machine learning methods]] are not easily explained in simple terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Strategies for Adoption
Feuerriegel suggests that the causal community must "move to their field and speak their language" rather than expecting practitioners to come to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Speak the User's Language:** Successful businesses don't focus on making people understand them; they make people feel understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This involves translating complex thoughts and mathematics into language that decision-makers and end-users can grasp and act upon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   *Example:* Instead of explaining correlation vs. causation, use the "two crystal balls" analogy: one for decision A and one for decision B, allowing managers to see future outcomes of different choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
*   **Augment, Don't Replace:** AI tools should augment human decision-makers, fostering trust and top-management support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Field Experiments:** Demonstrate impact through real-world validation. At ABB Hitachi, a rigorous field experiment showed a nearly 50% reduction in yield loss in semiconductor fabrication using a causal machine learning tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Education:** Educate people on why they need causal machine learning and how to implement it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This means simplifying explanations while retaining rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>.
*   **Reference Materials:** There's a growing need for accessible resources like books and "role model papers" that summarize causal machine learning ideas for managerial or medical audiences and outline best practices and robustness checks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:02">[00:19:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Areas for Improvement in AI Models for Practical Use

Feuerriegel identifies three pillars for improving AI models to make reliable inferences in fields like medicine:
1.  **Beyond Stylized Settings:** Move beyond standard, simplified settings common in computer science research to handle real-world complexities like time series, multiple continuous treatments (e.g., drug combinations), and complex treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
2.  **Uncertainty Quantification:** Unlike machine learning, medicine rigorously reports uncertainty intervals alongside point estimates. Reliable uncertainty quantification is considered the "holy grail" for bringing causal machine learning into medical practice for treatment recommendation and selection, as point estimates alone are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
3.  **Complex Treatments:** Developing methods to analyze complex treatments is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

## Real-World Examples of Applied Causal Machine Learning

Feuerriegel offers several examples debunking the criticism that causal machine learning is impossible to implement in practice:
*   **Diabetes Prevention Programs:** Partnered with a health insurance company in the Middle East to develop a two-stage causal machine learning model. This model first estimated the potential benefit of preventive care from electronic health records, then optimized the allocation of limited resources (e.g., lifestyle coaching, metformin treatment) to patients who would benefit most, leading to a cost-effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Media Company Front Page Optimization:** Worked with a large media company to frame the optimization of newspaper front-page content as a causal inference task. The system augmented editors' choices, revealing that articles by the chief editor, though previously hesitated to promote, were of great interest to readers and drove long-term impact and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Semiconductor Fabrication:** Collaborated with ABB Hitachi to implement a causal machine learning tool in the field to identify optimal improvement actions, resulting in a nearly 50% (49%) reduction in yield loss due to low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.
*   **Booking.com:** The travel platform utilizes [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal machine learning algorithms]] at a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Development Aid Allocation:** A KDD 2024 paper (with Milan K. Manovich) uses unique OECD data to suggest how to allocate development aid effectively across hundreds of stakeholders and countries, a sector spending 1.5 trillion dollars over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. This project showed that simpler models, like generalized propensity scores with polynomial regression, can outperform more complex approaches like neural networks in data-sparse environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>.

## Lessons Learned from Experience

### From Entrepreneurship
Feuerriegel's experience starting a company to improve corporate communication using machine learning in 2015 provided valuable lessons:
*   **Being Too Early:** Customers needed extensive education to trust AI systems, making widespread adoption difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.
*   **Customization Challenges:** Products requiring significant customization can lead to complex sales funnels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:35">[00:28:35]</a>.
*   **Don't Get Attached to Ideas:** Test ideas early and be willing to give up on them if a better business opportunity arises. Academics, in particular, may struggle with this due to attachment to their algorithms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:48">[00:28:48]</a>. This lesson applies to research as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:35">[00:29:35]</a>.

### The "One Day Rule"
For standard machine learning approaches (e.g., linear regression, random forest), if a satisfying performance isn't achieved on the first day, the data set or task might not be suitable for machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. Giving up early prevents bias from sunk costs and ensures projects are successful and inspiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:34">[00:30:34]</a>.

## Advice for Different Communities

### Causal Python Community
There is a need for more comprehensive open-source packages and software tools, beyond existing ones like EconML and Doubly Robust Machine Learning (DoubleML), to support various parts of the causal inference pipeline, such as partial identification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

### Managers and Entrepreneurs
It's essential to test AI ideas early to understand which methods work effectively and to identify valuable use cases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:54">[00:32:54]</a>. Simple methods (like an S-learner or traditional machine learning) might suffice for many applications, while others may require more rigorous [[Causal AI applications in business and technology | causal machine learning models]] like a Causal Forest or DoubleML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. Given the challenges of observing counterfactuals, testing what works in practice and is sufficiently robust is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>.

## Recipe for Success in Research

Feuerriegel attributes his team's consistent acceptance at top AI conferences to having a great team <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.
*   **Team DNA:** Joint lunches for discussion, whiteboards in offices, and a good team spirit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>.
*   **Diversity:** Encouraging diversity in backgrounds (mathematics, data science, statistics, computer science, economics) leads to different perspectives, problem-solving approaches, and complementary strengths. For example, an economics student once identified a flaw in randomization that a computer scientist missed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>, while computer science students excel with GPU clusters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, and mathematicians provide theoretical foundations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. This [[Interdisciplinary Approaches in AI Research | interdisciplinary approach]] allows for combining expertise, such as fitting complex models with theoretical proofs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.

Science is not a linear progression; it is a sprawling field driven by exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This exploratory nature fosters [[biological_inspirations_in_ai_models | interdisciplinary thinking]], which is crucial for significant advancements in artificial intelligence (AI) and machine learning (ML) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:07">[00:35:07]</a>.

## Blending Fields for Enhanced AI Models

Dr. Athanasios Bonos, a research scientist at the Advanced Causal Inference Lab at Spotify, emphasizes that [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | causality]] in AI is not solely about the modeling part. Instead, it encompasses the entire system-building process, from data collection and parameter consideration to robust deployment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This comprehensive view necessitates a blend of diverse expertises.

One example of an [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai | interdisciplinary approach]] is the adaptation of the synthetic control estimator—common in econometrics—with Pearl's reasoning framework and sensitivity analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. This combination creates robust models by explicitly challenging assumptions and understanding when models might fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The importance of explicitly stating and testing assumptions is paramount in [[causal_inference_models_and_ai_workshops | causal inference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>.

## Challenging Assumptions and Expanding Horizons

A key aspect of interdisciplinary research is the willingness to challenge fundamental assumptions. For instance, the assumption that models operate in Euclidean latent spaces was challenged, leading to the development of hyperbolic machine learning models and the exploration of Riemannian manifolds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. This exploration revealed that [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | causality]] does not emerge in a flat Euclidean space but requires a Lorentzian group space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. Such insights, often stemming from physics, inform the creation of new AI models built in "weird Riemannian spaces" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.

## Real-World Applications and Team Diversity

[[Translating AI Methods for Practical Use | Interdisciplinary approaches]] are vital when applying AI in practical settings, such as medical imaging or the operations of a company like Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. In medical imaging, the goal is to provide radiologists with better tools, not to replace them, recognizing the complexity of human decision-making and ethical considerations that AI systems cannot yet replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

The application of Technology Readiness Levels (TRLs)—a framework from the US military and NASA—to ML and AI algorithms is another instance of cross-domain knowledge transfer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This framework helps evaluate technology readiness, particularly in mission-critical fields like medicine and aeronautics, ensuring robustness and accountability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

Teams composed of individuals from diverse backgrounds are crucial for fostering creativity and solving complex problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. The Advanced Causal Inference Lab at Spotify, for instance, includes members with backgrounds in electrical engineering, computer science, reinforcement learning, astrophysics, and quantum physics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. This "melting pot" of expertises, reminiscent of Lockheed Martin's Skunk Works approach, enables faster innovation and the challenging of assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.

## The Innate Understanding of Causality and Future Directions

One of the most surprising and crucial lessons learned in applying [[causal_ai_applications_in_various_industries | causal AI in product contexts]] is that people, regardless of their formal training, possess an innate understanding of [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | causality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>. This makes it easier to integrate causal concepts into product development, as it aligns with how humans naturally learn and interact with the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:57">[00:38:57]</a>.

Future investments in [[trends_in_causal_ai | causal AI research]] should prioritize [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | causal discovery]]—the endeavor to identify causal connections that are not yet known—and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:40">[00:58:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>. [[Causal discovery]] is considered "true science" because it pushes the boundaries of knowledge, analogous to historical human explorations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:07">[00:47:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. It addresses fundamental unknowns, such as the full understanding of ionospheric impurities around the equator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:19">[00:45:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>. Education is vital to cultivate a societal skepticism towards spurious correlations and promote logical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:44">[00:58:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:09">[00:59:09]</a>.

Ultimately, science and technology are rarely linear paths; they are complex journeys driven by the essence of exploration and the collective effort of diverse individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:50">[03:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:05">[00:57:05]</a>. This interdisciplinary approach, fostering collaboration and the amalgamation of different ideas, is what leads to innovation and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

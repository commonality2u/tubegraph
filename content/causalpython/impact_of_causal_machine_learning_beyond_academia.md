From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 

Professor Stefan Feigel and his team are focused on making a distinctive impact in practice with [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]], moving beyond purely statistical challenges and theoretical theorems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Their vision is to develop, implement, and evaluate new AI algorithms to improve decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. This focus stems from a desire to improve the lives of patients and people more broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

## Real-world Applications

[[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | Causal machine learning]] has demonstrated significant impact in various real-world scenarios:

*   **Medicine**: Professor Feigel believes medicine is a field where [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] could have a profound impact on patients' lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Clinical Translation**: A key interest is the notion of "clinical translation," which involves making [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] accessible and useful for medical professionals in their day-to-day work, helping them answer new questions more rigorously to improve treatment selection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Diabetes Prevention Programs**: Collaboration with a large health insurance company in the Middle East used a two-stage [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] model to identify patients who would benefit most from preventive care programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. This approach allowed the health insurance company to allocate limited resources in the most cost-effective manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.
*   **Manufacturing**: At ABB Hitachi, a rigorous field experiment showed that a [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] tool could reduce yield loss in semiconductor fabrication by almost 50% (49%) over a four-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This helped them improve manufacturing processes and reduce low quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
*   **Media**: A large media company partnered to optimize the front page of their newspaper by framing the presentation of promoted content as a causal inference task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. This [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] approach empowered editors to make better decisions and drive long-term impact and revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:05:00">[14:05:00]</a>.
*   **Online Services**: Companies like booking.com run [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] algorithms at a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
*   **Development Aid**: Research using OECD data explores how [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] can suggest how to allocate development aid, a complex allocation problem involving trillions of dollars and hundreds of stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:19:00">[25:19:00]</a>.

## Facilitating Adoption and Addressing Challenges

To achieve widespread adoption of [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] methods beyond academia, several factors are crucial:

### Bridging the Communication Gap
*   The community needs to move to the field of other disciplines (medicine, marketing, business decision-making) and speak their language, rather than expecting them to adapt to the technical language of [[causal_inference_and_machine_learning | causal inference]] and [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | machine learning]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
*   Successful businesses often focus on making people *feel understood* rather than making people *understand* them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. This means translating complex mathematical algorithms into language decision-makers and practitioners can grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

### Simplifying Complex Concepts
*   Causality and [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] methods are not easy to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>, especially to users without a solid technical background in statistics, mathematics, or computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   A useful analogy for managers is the "crystal ball": instead of one crystal ball showing the future (prediction), managers want two crystal balls showing the future under different decisions (causation), allowing them to pick the best path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>.

### Strategic Implementation
*   **Augmenting Humans**: Rather than aiming to replace human experts, [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] should augment their capabilities, fostering trust and driving implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.
*   **Rigorous Field Experiments**: Demonstrating impact requires rigorous field experiments to show the tangible benefits of [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.
*   **Education**: Educating practitioners about the need and benefits of [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a>. This involves simplifying explanations without sacrificing rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:08:00">[17:08:00]</a>.
*   **Uncertainty Quantification**: A "holy grail" for bringing [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] methods into medical practice is reliable uncertainty quantification. Medical decisions, especially treatment recommendations, will not rely solely on point estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Appropriate Model Choice**: For many real-world applications, especially in small and medium enterprises, data sets are often small. Simpler models can be more robust and effective in data-sparse regimes compared to complex neural networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:50:00">[26:50:00]</a>.
*   **Testing Ideas Early**: It's important for researchers and practitioners to test ideas early and not be too attached to initial concepts if better opportunities arise or if the initial approach proves ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:48:00">[28:48:00]</a>. A "one-day rule" suggests that if a standard machine learning approach doesn't show satisfying performance on a dataset within the first day, the data or task might not be suitable for machine learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:57:00">[29:57:00]</a>.

### Developing Tools and Resources
*   More Python packages and software tools like `econML` and `doubleML` are needed, particularly for areas like partial identification, to make [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] ideas more accessible and widely adopted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:07:00">[31:07:00]</a>.
*   Summary pieces and "role model papers" that provide best practice steps and robustness checks are essential for educating professionals about the assumptions and application of [[causal_inference_and_machine_learning | causal inference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a>.

In conclusion, the impact of [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning_intersection | causal machine learning]] extends significantly beyond academia, driving real-world improvements in various sectors through careful application, clear communication, and the development of practical tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>.

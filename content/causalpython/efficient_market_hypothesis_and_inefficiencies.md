The concept of market efficiency has been a long-standing debate in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>. At its core, it questions whether the prices observed in the market truly reflect all available phenomena and if all market agents possess perfect information to arrive at a fair price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:05]</a>.

## Definitions and Degrees of Efficiency

There are various formulations of the efficient market hypothesis, including strong and weak forms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:21">[00:49:21]</a>. While it appears that markets are efficient to a certain degree, strong efficiency—meaning prices reflect all future information—is difficult to prove and has been challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Markets may reflect the best *possible* information, but they are likely not strongly efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:51">[00:49:51]</a>. Issues like drying up liquidity can also prevent accurate pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:05">[00:50:05]</a>.

## Exploiting Market Inefficiencies

Despite the concept of market efficiency, many individuals and entities actively make money by exploiting inefficiencies within the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:51">[00:48:51]</a>. This suggests that markets are not fully efficient, but rather possess a good degree of efficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:02">[00:51:02]</a>.

### The Role of [[causal_inference_in_finance | Causal Models]]

Building a relevant [[causal_inference_in_finance | causal model]] is considered a beneficial way to exploit market inefficiencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:17">[00:51:17]</a>. This is because causal models offer more stable and robust results compared to purely associational models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:31">[00:51:31]</a>. By understanding the underlying mechanisms that generate inefficiencies, rather than just observing correlations, one can develop more reliable strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

For example, an experiment to predict flu trends from Google searches on flu showed that while there might be an associational relationship, it's not causal, and the model broke down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:40">[00:51:40]</a>. A causal mechanism, by contrast, is more reflective of the true generating process and thus more stable and robust over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>.

### Limitations of Historical Data and Traditional Models

In the past, financial models often relied on the assumption of statistical repeatability and a stable data generating process, extracting stable statistical patterns from [[historical_vs_forwardlooking_risk_models | historical data]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. This proved problematic, as evidenced by the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Measures like Value-at-Risk (VaR), which rely on historical distributions, failed because the underlying distribution changed shape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Events previously considered rare became commonplace, leading to the collapse of many financial institutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

A significant issue was the incentive to misreport risk by using [[historical_vs_forwardlooking_risk_models | historical data]], even though many practitioners knew it wasn't representative. This aligned with incentives to take more risk for larger bonuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

### Market Intelligence vs. Economic Models

Interestingly, market views, such as inflation swap markets, have historically proven to be more accurate predictors than the average opinion of economists or even machine learning models based solely on fundamental economic data like interest rates, unemployment, and GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a>. This suggests that the market itself aggregates a significant amount of information efficiently, even if it's not perfectly efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:39">[00:50:39]</a>.

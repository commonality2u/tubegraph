Cal Bandits was founded around 2017 when causality was considered a very niche topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The early experience of building this community felt "very lonely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, with only a handful of people involved initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, from the first day, there was a belief that it would become significant, leading them to lay foundations to support exponential growth, which was observed by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## A Contrarian Bet in AI

The decision to pursue causality was a "contrarian bet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This perspective stemmed from previous experience in hedge funds for both the founder and co-founder Max <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Around the time Cal Bandits started, deep learning was gaining immense excitement, especially after AlphaGo beat the world champion at Go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Many researchers were pivoting their AI focus to deep learning, believing it would solve everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. However, the founders held a different view, recognizing that deep learning excelled in specific, fixed-rule scenarios like board games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Lessons from Hedge Funds

Working in the hedge fund world provided two key lessons that shaped their approach to [[Causal AI in business applications | Causal AI]]:
1.  **Nature of Patterns**: Relying solely on historical patterns and correlations in financial markets can be problematic because the past "almost never repeats" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The future is not necessarily predictive of the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.
2.  **Contrarian View**: Significant success often comes from taking a contrarian stance, doing something "completely different from everybody else" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This requires being contrarian *and* right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For them, [[Causal AI in business applications | Causal AI]] proved to be a "contrarian bet that was right" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Transition to Causality and Real-World Application

The founder's background is in computer science, specifically a PhD in computer vision focused on biometrics (recognizing things at a distance with cameras) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. In the lab, deep learning approaches showed incredible performance due to consistent backgrounds and environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, once taken into the real world, these systems "all broke down catastrophically" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

A shift to a model-based approach, which involved learning the underlying features and structures (e.g., how the human body moves, 3D shape of a head), yielded slightly worse lab performance but retained its performance in the real world, demonstrating significantly better generalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

This experience highlighted a crucial point:
> "If you don't have a model and if you don't really understand the cause and effect mechanisms, you can do really well in the lab but you're not going to do really well in the real world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>

This explains why 85-90% of AI projects fail to make it outside the lab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. [[Causality in marketing and product insight | Causality]] helps address two fundamental challenges in taking AI from lab to real world: ensuring real-world functionality and building human trust through explainability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Client Use Cases: Modeling Physical Systems
A concrete use case involves modeling physical systems, such as a manufacturing process or a device within a machine, where "real Parts connected to real Parts" demonstrate a true cause and effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. A client initially tried deep learning, which failed catastrophically in the real world despite lab success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Even after working with six deep learning companies, their senior leadership lacked understanding and trust in the models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

By adopting [[Causal AI in business applications | Causal AI]], they performed automated causal discovery on the data to create a "digital twin" of the machine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This causal diagram was then presented to domain experts, who could identify and correct inaccuracies, inserting missing causal links where faults had never occurred, thus allowing for human involvement "from the very beginning" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This iterative process, involving expert knowledge, algorithms, and expert consultation, typically takes only a few rounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Early Entrepreneurial Spirit: The Mosquito Device

The founder's entrepreneurial journey began at age six or seven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. During a bad mosquito season, his university-aged cousin, who was studying electronics, was building devices that supposedly chased mosquitoes using ultrasound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The founder learned soldering and decided to build multiple devices from his cousin's blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

His motivation was twofold: to help classmates suffering from insect bites and to earn pocket money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. He first built an "MVP" (Minimum Viable Product) to test the market, selling it within 10 minutes of showing it at school <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This led to pre-orders, and he built 20 devices for the whole class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>.

> "My entrepreneurial lesson there from this experiment was that you need to also worry about payment terms and and you know discuss those things before giving the the the product away." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>

Despite a "substantial lack of payment," the experience was deemed worthwhile because the class had fewer insect bites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

## The Genesis of a Software Enthusiast

This early venture instilled a desire to build things that positively impact people's lives and to do so "at scale" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Growing up during the rise of the internet and programming, the founder was inspired by another cousin's friend who worked for a US company coding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Without owning a computer around 1995 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>, he received a programming book and spent a summer learning Pascal and Delphi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. This experience revealed that software was "so much faster than building and soldering stuff" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>, as one creation could be multiplied infinitely, making it the ideal "vehicle to really make an impact on the World" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

## The Role of Mentorship

The founder emphasizes the significant role of his cousin as a role model during his formative years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. Being "surrounded by someone that was building electronics and and software" truly changed his life's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>.

## Future of AI: Combining Causal and Generative AI

While generative AI is seen as a significant future development, the speaker believes that [[Intersection of causality and AI technologies | causal AI]] also plays an important role in the advancement of intelligent and decision-making systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

Generative AI and [[Causal AI in business applications | causal AI]] are "amazing for certain things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. The true potential lies in combining these technologies, where "1 + 1 equals 3," representing a large and underexploited opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. However, achieving Artificial General Intelligence (AGI) will likely require additional building blocks that are currently unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>. The immediate focus should be on combining these two technologies to identify existing gaps before new theories and research can fill them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

## Challenges and Harmonization in Causal AI

A significant gap in the field of [[Causal AI in business applications | causal AI]] is the "lack of harmonization of the packages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:26">[00:21:26]</a>. There is a need for a unified interface that allows all causal discovery packages, causal modeling packages, and decision intelligence engines to work similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. This unification, similar to what Scikit-learn provides for machine learning, is crucial for wider adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Cal Bandits plans to contribute to this by open-sourcing their interfaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>.

For those starting in [[Causal AI in business applications | causality]], the advice is:
*   Be confident, as [[Causal AI in business applications | causal AI]] is now more accessible with books and open-source packages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.
*   Read "The Book of Why" to understand foundational causal theory and terminology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   Experiment with open-source tooling, as many new causal packages are emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   Attend community events like the Causal AI conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>.

This article details the announcements made during a live stream, following a recent workshop on causality and large language models. The announcements include upcoming podcast episodes, a book translation, and future events.

## Book Giveaway
A [[book_giveaway_winners_announcement | book giveaway]] was announced for viewers of the live stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:30">[02:51:30]</a>. Participants can fill out a survey by Friday, March 15, 2024, at 11:00 AM GMT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:39">[03:58:39]</a>. Three print books and three e-books are being given away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>.

## Upcoming Podcast Episodes
*   **Causal Bandits Podcast**
    *   A new episode of the Causal Bandits podcast featuring Stephen Senn, a statistician and experimenter involved in drug trials, will be released on Monday, March 11, 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>. This episode offers a perspective from outside the machine learning and observational causal inference fields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:51">[03:11:51]</a>.
*   **Causal Bandit Extra Episodes**
    *   Over the next few weeks, "Causal Bandit Extra" episodes will be released <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:20">[03:15:20]</a>. These short, condensed episodes feature conversations with researchers and attendees from the triple A.I. conference about their work on causality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.
    *   Featured guests include Andrew Lampinen from Google DeepMind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>, Scott Miller from UCLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a> (who works with Judea Pearl on counterfactual reasoning) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:20">[03:41:20]</a>, and Emily McMillin from Meta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.

## Book Translation Announcement
Alex's book, *Causal Inference in Python*, has been translated into Spanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>. The Spanish version, titled *Inferencia Causal en Python*, is set to be released on April 25 in Spain and Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:13">[03:18:13]</a>. This translation aims to broaden access to causal inference ideas for Spanish speakers globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:48">[03:40:48]</a>.

## Follow-up Workshop
Inspired by the participants' feedback, the organizers are planning a follow-up [[Causal inference models and AI workshops | workshop]] at a major conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:50">[02:53:50]</a>. More concrete details will be announced within a couple of months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:51">[03:00:51]</a>. During the live stream, a question was posed about the possibility of using Mamba models for causal inference, which was noted as an open question for future exploration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:50">[03:11:50]</a>.

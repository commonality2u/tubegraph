Integrating [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal AI]] within business environments presents several challenges, ranging from cognitive hurdles and communication gaps to technical complexities and practical application issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Communication and Stakeholder Engagement
A primary challenge is effectively introducing and gaining acceptance for [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal AI]] within a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. This involves:
*   **Overcoming skepticism** about the usefulness of [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.
*   **Bridging the cognitive effort gap** required from stakeholders to understand [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>, which can be challenging even with many online resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
*   **Ensuring clear communication** at every stage, from problem definition to modeling and knowledge transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. Success depends on aligning technical and non-technical personnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
*   **Transmitting insights effectively** and asking the right questions to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. Each business case is unique, meaning there's no prescribed method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Convincing business leaders** (e.g., CMOs and CFOs) about the importance and value of advanced analytics and [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal approaches]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>, especially when dealing with conflicting objectives like marketing spend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a>.
*   **Explaining AI concepts** to clients in a way that is understandable and builds trust without being overly technical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.
*   [[Causal AI and machine learning | Causal AI]] contributes to [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | explainable AI]], making it easier to justify decisions and proposed directions to stakeholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>.

## Technical and Methodological Challenges
Even for experienced practitioners, technical challenges arise:
*   **Understanding problem specifics** and the factors at play, as each new problem presents different settings and factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **Designing causal analyses:** Determining the scope of relevance for factors in a causal diagram and knowing where to stop adding detail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>.
*   **Distinguishing identification from estimation:** A key concept often misunderstood, leading to misapplication of methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. It's crucial to understand assumptions like randomized treatment assignment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Addressing changing causal graphs over time:** The non-stationary and dynamic nature of real-world systems poses a significant theoretical challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.
*   **Handling broken positivity assumptions** in causal effect estimation, particularly in domains like banking where ground knowledge may not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.
*   **Ensuring the truthfulness and completeness of causal graphs** and understanding the uncertainty in predictions derived from them, given that ground truth is often unknown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.
*   **Verifying the accuracy of estimated treatment effects** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>.

## Practical Implementation Challenges
Beyond theoretical understanding, practical challenges hinder widespread adoption:
*   **Keeping up with constant changes** in the industry and the rapid evolution of [[causal_ai_and_machine_learning | AI models]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Learning new models, understanding their assumptions, and combining them takes significant time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.
*   **Limited resources** (tools, people) to answer all pressing questions, despite the breakthrough potential of [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal inference]] and [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal AI]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
*   **Testing new [[trends_in_causal_ai | causal AI]] visions** brought from conferences within a company can be difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Matching [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal AI]] insights with business intuition** and integrating business perspectives into [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal AI]] models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:59:00">[19:59:00]</a>.

## Specific Business Domain Challenges
Challenges are also evident in specific industries:
*   **Marketing:**
    *   Balancing interpretability with accuracy in marketing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>.
    *   Answering "what if" questions, such as the effectiveness of not doing marketing, incrementality, or spending more on specific channels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
    *   Measuring the long-term effectiveness of brand marketing, where immediate KPIs are not visible, making it hard to assess the causal impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a>.
*   **Banking:**
    *   Understanding factors to design solutions for customers struggling with debt and for the bank itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
*   **E-commerce:**
    *   Dealing with cannibalization and interference, and incorporating these concepts into modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
*   **Supply Chain Management:**
    *   Using [[causal_ai_in_supply_chain_management | causal AI]] to predict demand and disentangle complex relationships and directions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>.

Despite these [[causality_and_ai_challenges_and_opportunities | challenges and advancements in causal AI]], there is significant enthusiasm for applying [[causal_ai_applications_in_business_and_technology | causal methods]] across various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

## Understanding Why Children Throw Objects

When a child holds a block or toy and throws it away, parents may sometimes react negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This is often because parents interpret such actions as aggressive behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. However, while aggression can sometimes be the case, most of the time children throw things because it helps them [[Childrens learning through interaction | learn]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This behavior assists them in understanding how the physical world works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

This method of [[Childrens learning through interaction | learning]] is one way in which [[Childrens learning through interaction | children's learning]] differs from how most [[differences_between_children_and_machine_learning_systems | machine learning systems]] acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Research on Infant Experimentation

[[Developmental psychology and child learning | Alison Gopnik]], an American [[Developmental psychology and child learning | developmental psychologist]], has demonstrated that [[Childrens learning through interaction | children]] conduct systematic experiments to learn the laws of physics and the rules of social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

[[Research on infant experimentation | Amy S. S. and Lisa Fenson]] from Johns Hopkins University have shown in their [[Research on infant experimentation | research]] that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects that display unpredictable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, they might prefer toys that can pass through walls rather than those with more predictable characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Benefits of Interactive Learning

Infants' ability to interact with the world offers several advantages for their [[Childrens learning through interaction | learning]]:
*   **Robust Learning** This interaction makes their [[Childrens learning through interaction | learning]] more robust compared to merely observing the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis Formation** It informs them which hypothesis to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Interactive Chain** This process creates an interactive chain of hypotheses and tests aimed at falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

This combination of factors provides [[Childrens learning through interaction | children]] with a powerful toolkit for building effective models of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This capability differentiates infants and later [[Childrens learning through interaction | children]] from most contemporary [[differences_between_children_and_machine_learning_systems | machine learning systems]], which typically learn in a more static manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. The consequences of static versus active [[Childrens learning through interaction | learning]] will be discussed further in subsequent videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

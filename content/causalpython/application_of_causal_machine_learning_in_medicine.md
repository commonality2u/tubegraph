[[Causal AI in Medicine | Causal machine learning]] holds significant potential to make a profound impact on the lives of patients and improve medical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>. Professor Stefan Feuerriegel's team is deeply invested in this area, recognizing medicine as a field where these advancements can have a distinctive, practical impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. The ultimate vision is to develop, implement, and evaluate new AI algorithms to improve decision-making, including in medical contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Clinical Translation and Adoption Challenges

A key concept in this field is "clinical translation," which refers to the process of getting medical professionals to actually use [[Causal AI in Medicine | causal machine learning]] methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. Medical professionals have busy schedules and often lack a solid technical background in statistics, mathematics, or computer science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>.

To facilitate adoption, the [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal community]] needs to:
*   Move to their field and speak their language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   Translate methods into their practice and language, making them feel understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.
*   Explain complex [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]] concepts in crisp, simple words to enable actionable insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.
*   Provide tools that help users make decisions without needing a deep technical background in statistics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. This means simplifying choices like "S-learner, T-learner, or double robust learner" for medical professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### Bridging the Gap

The community has made significant progress in popularizing concepts, moving towards less "hermetic" language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. An effective approach is to explain [[Causal inference and machine learning | causal machine learning]] through analogies that resonate with decision-makers, such as comparing a crystal ball that predicts the future with two crystal balls that show the outcome of different decisions, enabling them to choose the best action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

## Key Research Areas and Applications

Professor Feuerriegel's team focuses on three pillars to improve models for reliable inferences in medical practice:

### 1. Beyond Stylized Settings
*   **Moving beyond standard settings**: Developing treatment effect estimation methods that go beyond binary treatments and outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
*   **Time series settings**: Researching [[advances in causal machine learning research | causal machine learning]] for analyzing time-dependent treatment effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>.
*   **Complex treatments**: Working on methods for drug combinations (multiple continuous treatments) and complex treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### 2. Uncertainty Quantification
*   [[Challenges in causal machine learning compared to traditional methods | Machine learning often overlooks uncertainty quantification]], which is standard and critical in medicine for reliable decision-making and treatment recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   [[Benefits and challenges of causal machine learning | Causal machine learning]] methods for treatment effect estimation need to improve reliable uncertainty quantification (e.g., using conformal prediction, sensitivity analysis, partial identification) to be adopted in medical practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Medical practice will not use methods that rely solely on point estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

### 3. Impact Beyond Academia
The team's research is driven by the desire to achieve practical impact and improve the lives of patients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.

#### Example: Diabetes Prevention Program
In a collaboration with a large health insurance company in the Middle East, [[Machine learning and causal inference methodologies | causal machine learning]] was used to improve diabetes prevention programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.
*   **Problem**: Limited resources necessitate targeting preventive measures (e.g., Metformin treatment, lifestyle coaching) to patients who will benefit the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. Traditional predictive machine learning only identifies those at highest risk, not those who would benefit most from intervention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.
*   **Solution**: A two-stage [[Machine learning and causal inference methodologies | causal machine learning]] model was developed:
    1.  Estimate the potential benefit of preventive care from electronic health records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.
    2.  Develop an optimization model to identify patients who would benefit the most, enabling cost-effective allocation of limited resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:27:00">[12:27:00]</a>.

## Dispelling Criticisms: Real-World Evidence

Criticisms suggesting that [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]] is impossible to implement in practice or drive real-world outcomes are disagreed with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>. Real-world examples demonstrate the impact of [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]]:

*   **Media Company**: Optimizing newspaper front pages by framing content promotion as a [[Causal inference and machine learning | causal inference]] task. This developed decision support systems that augmented editors' choices, empowering them to make better decisions and drive long-term impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.
*   **ABB Hitachi**: Implementing a [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]] tool in semiconductor fabrication that helped reduce yield loss by almost 50% (49%) over a four-month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:43:00">[14:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. This demonstrated a causal approach to changing manufacturing processes to improve quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>.
*   **Booking.com**: Running [[Causal inference and machine learning | causal machine learning]] algorithms at a large scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>.

To successfully integrate [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]] into practice, three elements are important:
1.  **Augment, not replace**: Aim to augment humans rather than replace them, fostering trust and top management drive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>. This requires significant education and explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>.
2.  **Rigorous field experiments**: Conduct rigorous field experiments to demonstrate impact, as seen with ABB Hitachi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.
3.  **Educate people**: Continue to educate people, explaining concepts in simple terms that domain experts and managers can understand, without sacrificing rigor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:37:00">[16:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for Learning About Causal Machine Learning

For audiences new to or only superficially familiar with [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]], it's recommended to:
*   Explore new summary pieces and papers that offer overviews for specific audiences, such as the Nature Medicine paper on [[Causal AI in Medicine | causal machine learning]] for predicting treatment outcomes for a medical audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:00">[24:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:08:00">[19:08:00]</a>.
*   Look for "role model" papers that illustrate best practice steps, including robustness checks, given that causality rests on many assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:32:00">[19:32:00]</a>.
*   Seek out examples that demonstrate practical applications in complex allocation problems, such as using [[Causal AI and machine learning intersection | causal machine learning]] to allocate development aid effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:42:00">[24:42:00]</a>.

For practitioners and managers, it's crucial to test ideas and identify effective use cases for different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:54:00">[32:54:00]</a>. While a simple traditional machine learning method like an S-learner might suffice for many applications, others may require more rigorous [[Machine learning and causal inference methodologies | causal machine learning]] methods such as a causal forest or models from the double machine learning (DoubleML) suite, especially when counterfactual values are unobserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:06:00">[33:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:33:00">[33:33:00]</a>.

## General Approach to Open Source
Andrew Lawrence, Director of Research at Causal Lens, states that Causal Lens often modifies well-known algorithms or [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] implementations to better serve their clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:42">[01:42:42]</a>. The company's product is designed as a cloud platform for decision-making, allowing users to launch Jupyter Lab sessions and utilize Causal Lens's packages alongside [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:02">[02:20:02]</a>. There is no limitation on users incorporating [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:29">[02:20:29]</a>.

## Specific Integrations and Contributions
Causal Lens has integrated Mappy, an [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] library for conformal prediction, into its causal impact package <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. This integration provides uncertainty estimations for time series analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:12">[02:20:12]</a>. They also have templates that guide users on how to discover a graph using [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] tools like Huawei's G-Castle and then integrate that graph into Causal Lens's structural causal modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:30">[02:20:30]</a>.

Causal Lens has [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-sourced]] software that allows users to quickly generate synthetic time series data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:24">[02:26:24]</a>. This software helps in validating how sensitive various [[causality_and_causal_models|causal discovery]] methods are to violations of their underlying assumptions, such as linearity or Gaussian noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:42">[02:26:42]</a>.

The company aims to make its packages modular and use-case agnostic, ensuring they are well-documented, tested, and maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:48">[02:20:48]</a>. They follow a monthly release cadence to add new functionality, address feature requests, and fix bugs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:28">[02:21:28]</a>. Their packages support Python versions 3.8 to 3.11 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:43">[02:21:43]</a>. For metrics, they use [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] packages like Scikit-Uplift for uplift modeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>.

## Challenges and Future Directions
A significant challenge in the [[causality_and_causal_models|causal discovery]] literature is the scarcity of ground truth for real-world data, leading to a reliance on benchmarking against randomly generated graphs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. Initiatives like the Clear conference's "call for data sets" are crucial for addressing this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:09">[02:40:09]</a>.

The "Beware of the simulated DAG" paper highlighted that properties in synthetic data might make [[causality_and_causal_models|causal discovery]] algorithms perform better than they would on real-world data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:08">[02:38:08]</a>. Andrew Lawrence noted that the original No Tears paper, often used for [[causality_and_causal_models|causal discovery]], was actually intended for Bayesian networks and didn't claim to be a perfect [[causality_and_causal_models|causal discovery]] algorithm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:37">[02:40:37]</a>.

Causal Lens is moving further into [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-source]] by releasing its front-end package, Dara, which is a framework for building applications to ingest data and support decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>. They have also [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|open-sourced]] their [[causality_and_causal_models|causal graph]] library, which includes a graph viewer component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. Their GitHub repository contains code from time series [[causality_and_causal_models|causal discovery]] papers and reproductions of results from papers like "Unsuitability of No Tears" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Andrew Lawrence emphasizes the importance of continuous [[communication_and_collaboration_in_causal_research|communication and collaboration]] within the [[open_source_projects_in_causal_ai|causal Python community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. He highlights that brainstorming and meeting with other practitioners, researchers, and developers naturally spark new ideas, such as applying rank deficiency for estimating latent confounders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

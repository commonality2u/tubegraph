From: [[causalpython]] <br/> 

This article explores key concepts and applications of [[Causal inference and its applications | causal inference]], drawing insights from a book that addresses this topic. The book aims to provide practical guidance for applying these methods, particularly using Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Unique Approach to Causal Inference

The book discusses [[Causal inference and its applications | causal inference]] and [[Causal Discovery versus Causal Inference | causal discovery]] from a practical standpoint, focusing on application using Python <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Feedback from readers indicates that the explanations are intuitive, helping them grasp complex concepts more easily than with other materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

A distinguishing feature of this book is its unique content:
*   It is currently the only book on the market that discusses both [[Causal inference and its applications | causal inference]] and [[Causal Discovery versus Causal Inference | causal discovery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
*   It uniquely covers causality in the context of deep learning and large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
*   This combination of topics, especially with a focus on Python, makes it unique in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Key Learnings in Causal Inference

The discussion highlights three fundamental learnings regarding [[Causal inference and its applications | causal inference]] and data:

### 1. Data Alone Is Not Enough
Data alone is insufficient to answer some of the most interesting questions in both business and science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In these fields, there is a primary interest in "what-if" questions, such as:
*   "What would change in the world if we had done something?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>
*   "What change do we expect in the world if we go and act?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>

This pursuit differs significantly from merely predicting something statically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Thus, data often falls short for addressing the most impactful questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### 2. Importance of Process
Achieving good results in [[Causal inference and its applications | causal inference]] necessitates a systematic process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. It's crucial to understand the methods being employed and to execute them in an organized manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

### 3. Data Generating Process Leaves Traces
Although data alone is often not enough, the process by which data is generated frequently leaves identifiable traces within the data itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Approaching data analysis like a detective, one can look for these partial traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. By combining these findings with expert knowledge and realistic assumptions, it becomes possible to achieve truly interesting and insightful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

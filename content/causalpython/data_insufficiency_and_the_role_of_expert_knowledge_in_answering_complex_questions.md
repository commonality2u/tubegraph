In both business and science, data alone is often insufficient to answer the most compelling questions [00:01:21]. This limitation arises because many critical questions pertain to understanding "what would change in the world if we've done something" or "what change do we expect if we go and act in the world" [00:01:38]. Such inquiries differ significantly from merely predicting something statically [00:01:49]. Therefore, a primary insight is that data is frequently inadequate for addressing the most interesting questions we might pose [00:01:54].

## The Importance of Process

Achieving meaningful results requires a systematic approach and a deep understanding of the work being done [00:02:08]. The importance of a well-defined process is a key learning [00:02:17].

## Integrating Expert Knowledge

While data alone has limitations, the data-generating process can leave discernible traces within the data [00:02:28]. To answer important questions, one can approach data analysis like "playing detective" [00:02:41], seeking out these partial traces [00:02:46].

A crucial step in addressing data insufficiency is the [[the_integration_of_expert_knowledge_in_causal_models | integration of expert knowledge]] [00:02:49]. By combining these traces from the data with expert insights and realistic assumptions, it becomes possible to achieve truly significant results [00:02:51]. This methodology helps overcome the [[challenges_in_identifying_causal_relationships | challenges in identifying causal relationships]] and supports [[causal_inference_and_decision_making | causal inference and decision making]].

To answer the most interesting questions in both business and science, data alone is often not enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Many critical questions revolve around understanding "what would change in the world if we've done something" or "what change do we expect if we go and act in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This differs significantly from merely predicting something statically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Beyond Static Prediction: Why Data Alone Is Insufficient

The primary learning is that data by itself is frequently inadequate to address the most compelling questions that arise in business and scientific contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. These questions often require an understanding of [[causality_in_marketing_and_data_science | causality]], i.e., how interventions or actions influence outcomes, which goes beyond simple correlation or prediction.

## The Critical Role of Process

A second crucial learning emphasizes the importance of the process itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. To achieve good results, it is essential to:
*   Understand the subject matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   Understand the actions being undertaken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   Execute tasks in a systematic way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Uncovering Insights: Traces of the Data Generating Process

The third key learning highlights that the data generating process often leaves discernible traces within the data itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Although data alone cannot answer many important questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, by adopting a "detective" approach to analyze data for these partial traces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, and then integrating expert knowledge and realistic assumptions, it becomes possible to yield truly interesting results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

> [!INFO] A Practical Approach to Causal Inference
> A book specifically designed for practical application in Python discusses "codal inference" and "codal discovery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. It is presented in an intuitive manner, helping readers grasp complex concepts more easily than other materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The book is unique in its focus on [[causality_in_marketing_and_data_science | causality]] within the context of deep learning and large language models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, offering a combination of topics not found elsewhere, especially with Python integration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

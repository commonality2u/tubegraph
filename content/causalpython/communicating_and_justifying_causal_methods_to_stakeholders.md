## The Challenge of Justification
Early in one's career, it becomes apparent that statistics alone may not be enough to answer the most interesting business questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:05">[00:46:05]</a>. Statistical significance alone is not enough for a result to mean something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>; a deeper understanding of the data generating process is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

A significant challenge in [[application_of_causal_methods_in_industry | applying causal inference methods]] is convincing stakeholders of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Organizations already collect and aggregate data for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>, so demonstrating that a different aggregation method will generate substantial value is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:12">[00:39:12]</a>. It can be challenging to make them realize why what is being said is true, especially when results are counterintuitive or might make them look bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:41:54]</a>.

## Strategies for Effective Communication

### Setting Expectations
A crucial way to address this challenge is to set expectations correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. Instead of claiming absolute truth, one should explain that causal methods offer a higher probability of correctness or are more accurate than regular data analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Comparing causal inference to basic correlations, rather than aiming for the truth of a Randomized Control Trial (RCT), makes it easier to demonstrate its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:24">[00:40:24]</a>.

### Transparency and Data Connection
One of the most effective ways to convey value and build trust with stakeholders is the ability to clearly tie results back to the underlying data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. Regardless of the method's rigor or sophistication, if it cannot be connected back to the data, the chances of convincing decision-makers in difficult situations are very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

A core principle in developing causal methods should be complete transparency, allowing stakeholders to see how every calculation leading to the final answer is derived from their data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:41">[00:42:41]</a>. This transparency empowers them by enabling them to reproduce and verify the results, fostering ownership and belief in the findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.

### Causality as a Spectrum
It is prudent to view causality not as a binary state but as a spectrum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>. Making estimates "somewhat more causal" is always preferable to relying on plain correlations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. The focus should be on finding methods that yield the highest guarantees with the lowest costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.

Even organizations with fewer resources can adopt services that enable them to tap into [[causal_tools_and_methodologies_in_business_applications | causal inference]] with lower guarantees, ultimately leading to more causal conclusions than traditional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.

### The Role of Technology and Business Impact
The rise of large language models (LLMs) and their intelligent behavior has opened the door for people to believe in complex concepts that might initially be hard to understand, including causal inference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. This has contributed to the field gaining steam not only in academia but also in industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:38">[00:45:38]</a>, with more business leaders investing in and understanding its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:44">[00:45:44]</a>.

For practitioners, it's essential to persist in the journey to become better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>. Doing science correctly, handling confounding, and accounting for the time dimension are crucial to avoid hurting the business instead of helping it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:59">[00:59:59]</a>. Applying [[causal_analysis_and_decision_making | causal inference methods]] is not just a formality; it directly helps drive better decision-making and enables the business to thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:37">[01:00:37]</a>.

## Personal Journey and Advice for Practitioners
A personal journey into causal inference often starts with realizing the limitations of traditional statistics in answering complex business questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:45">[01:23:45]</a>. For example, in email campaigns, the goal is not merely predicting which users will churn, but rather identifying who will respond best to a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This distinction highlights that statistical associations alone are often insufficient for effective [[causal_analysis_and_decision_making | decision making]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

To gain a deep understanding necessary for applying causal methods in real-world scenarios, one approach is to write a blog or give lectures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This process forces a deeper understanding to explain complex topics approachably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Implementing code examples and simulating models helps in understanding the specifics of how things work and uncover overlooked aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

This self-study can lead to unexpected opportunities, such as being contacted by companies seeking expertise in [[evaluating_and_explaining_causal_models_in_industry | applying causal inference]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. The next step in advancing in the field is actually applying these methods in a professional setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. This real-world application involves answering tough questions from superiors about method efficacy and business impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Addressing the Man-Hour Cost
All costs, whether for making sound assumptions, consulting domain experts, or running experiments, can be equated to the cost of man-hours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. The aim is to develop methods that enable [[practical_applications_of_causal_methods | causal inference]] in low-resource environments, even if it means accepting a lower degree of guarantees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. The value lies in offering more causal estimates compared to what would be available without these methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:28">[00:35:28]</a>.

For instance, a golfing app customer used the described methodology to uncover that a feature with low traction actually had great potential to drive user KPIs, leading to significant top-line KPI improvements by making it part of the onboarding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>. This illustrates the power of [[challenges_in_implementing_causal_analysis_in_practice | causal analysis]] in identifying true drivers of business outcomes.

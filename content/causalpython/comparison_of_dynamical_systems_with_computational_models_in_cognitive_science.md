The field of cognitive science has seen a long-standing debate regarding the best approach to understanding cognition: whether it is akin to a computer or a dynamical system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:05">[00:29:05]</a>. This discussion often revolves around how the brain works and how different models can describe its processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>.

## The Computational View

Historically, a prominent project in cognitive science views the brain as a computer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a>. This perspective, tracing back to Turing's theories of computation, posits that tasks can be divided into subtasks performed by modules, similar to how computers operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>.

## The Dynamical Systems View

The dynamical picture emerged as an alternative, suggesting that cognition might not work by dividing processes into discrete tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. An example illustrating this view is human walking: it's not a sequence of paused, balanced, and then leg-moving actions, but rather a continuous process where everything happens in real time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. This perspective gained traction as machines became adept at chess but struggled with tasks like walking, suggesting a potential flaw in the purely computational approach for certain cognitive functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.

## Compatibility and Scales

Dr. Naftali Weinberger suggests that these two perspectives, computational and dynamical, are not necessarily in conflict but can be seen as two different ways of thinking about the same system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>. He prefers the concept of "scales" over "levels" for discussing phenomena, finding it more precise and scientifically interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>. When considering a system at different scales, one is essentially considering different objects or descriptions, similar to zooming in and out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>. For example, turning on an oven makes a room hotter in 5 minutes, but an hour later, due to a thermostat, the room is not hotter; this isn't a contradiction but different behaviors at different time scales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

In this view, patterns of regularity can [[Approaches for studying intelligence in biological systems | emerge]] at a different scale even if a lower level description appears chaotic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. This approach avoids certain metaphysical puzzles that arise when thinking in rigid "levels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

## Relationship to Modeling Assumptions

Both dynamical models and computational models involve modeling assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:04">[00:33:04]</a>. The idea that dynamical models are "pure descriptions" is challenged, as they also make implicit assumptions about intervals, boundary conditions, initial conditions, and parameter values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. These are not fundamentally different from the assumptions in causal models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>.

It is a common misconception that a less complex description of a system automatically implies fewer assumptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. However, causal models, for instance, explicitly show assumptions through missing arrows between variables, which implies strong claims about non-causation or lack of common causes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:43">[00:34:43]</a>.

## Research Examples

Research by Randy Beer's lab at Indiana University, involving artificial organisms with multiple neurons evolved to perform tasks like finding food or avoiding poison, provides a concrete example for studying cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>. By analyzing these simple, non-conscious agents, researchers can understand how different representational models, whether computational or dynamic, apply or conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. This work shows that studying simpler systems with a bit of complexity can be more fruitful than immediately tackling "sexier" but less understood high-level tasks like human cognition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:01">[00:31:01]</a>.

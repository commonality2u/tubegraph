Children often engage in behaviors that might seem aggressive or unproductive, such as throwing a block or toy away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While some [[parents_perceptions_of_childrens_behaviors | parents might interpret these behaviors negatively]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, assuming they are aggressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>, it turns out that most of the time children throw things because it aids their learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This act helps them understand how the physical world operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This is just one of the ways that [[childrens_learning_through_interaction | children's learning]] differs significantly from how most [[differences_between_children_and_machine_learning_systems | machine learning systems]] acquire knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Learning Through Experimentation

Developmental psychologists have extensively researched how children learn:
*   **Systematic Experimentation** Alison Gopnik, an American developmental psychologist, has demonstrated that children perform systematic experiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These experiments enable them to learn the laws of physics and the rules governing social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.
*   **Preference for Unpredictability** [[research_on_infant_experimentation | Research from Amy St. and Lisa Fenson]] at Johns Hopkins University has shown that infants as young as 11 months prefer to experiment with objects that exhibit unpredictable properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. An example of such an object would be a toy that appears to pass through walls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, rather than playing with more predictable toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Benefits of Interactive Learning

An infant's ability to [[childrens_learning_through_interaction | interact with the world]] provides several advantages for their learning:
*   **Robust Learning** It makes their learning more robust compared to merely observing their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Hypothesis Testing** Interaction also informs children about which hypotheses to test next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This creates an interactive chain of hypotheses and tests aimed at falsifying them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Collectively, this interactive approach equips children with a powerful toolkit for building effective models of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This capability is what makes infants and children [[differences_between_children_and_machine_learning_systems | distinct from most contemporary machine learning systems]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, which typically learn in a more static manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. The consequences of learning in a static versus an active way are a subject of further discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

The procurement of electric vehicles (EVs) and the role of incentives in this process are significant considerations for environmental sustainability. Governments and policymakers aim to incentivize the purchase of EVs to reduce greenhouse gas emissions and support environmental goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>. However, the effectiveness of these incentives is not always straightforward due to complexities in environmental impact and consumer behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:30">[08:30:30]</a>.

## Challenges with Current Incentive Strategies

While EVs are generally considered better for the environment than internal combustion engine (ICE) vehicles, their manufacturing greenhouse gas emissions are substantially higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:30">[08:30:30]</a>. A critical challenge arises if an incentivized EV is not driven sufficiently by the purchaser. Many individuals buy EVs as complementary vehicles, meaning their primary mileage still comes from ICE vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. In such cases, the electric vehicle can paradoxically have a negative environmental impact compared to if it had never been purchased at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:59:00">[08:59:00]</a>.

This highlights the importance for governments and policymakers to ensure they incentivize the "right people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:06">[09:04:06]</a>.

## Causal Approaches to Incentive Design

Addressing this problem involves a deep understanding of counterfactual scenarios and unit selection, drawing on concepts like probabilities of necessity and sufficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

The challenge lies in the varied responses of households to incentives:
*   Some households might respond negatively to incentives, particularly if the incentive originates from a government or political party they oppose. This could lead them to avoid purchasing an EV, thereby cutting them off from lower greenhouse gas emissions for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Such a harmful outcome is something policymakers wish to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.
*   Conversely, an effective incentive leads an individual to purchase an EV and drive it extensively, especially if they would not have done so or driven it less without the incentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. This represents a "probability of benefit" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

To optimize incentive programs, a proposed formula incorporates weights for different response types <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. For example, a harmful outcome (e.g., an incentive causing someone to *not* buy an EV they otherwise would have) might be assigned a heavily negative weight (e.g., -10) to strongly discourage such scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>. Beneficial outcomes (where the incentive effectively leads to increased EV use) would still have a positive weight (e.g., 2), indicating a desired outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>.

## Insights and Impact

### Main Insights
The primary insight from this work is that the choice of weights for different response types can significantly alter conclusions about which groups to incentivize and the nature of the incentives themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of carefully considering the full spectrum of potential outcomes when designing policy. This work applies existing causal knowledge to the electric vehicle industry and government policy-making, which can contribute to the [[integration_of_causality_in_economic_modeling|integration of causality in economic modeling]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

### Real-World Impact
The overarching hope is that this research will empower governments and policymakers to make more informed decisions, leading to incentive programs that genuinely benefit the environment by targeting the appropriate individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>. This aligns with the broader goal of [[evaluating_and_explaining_causal_models_in_industry|evaluating and explaining causal models in industry]] and policy for practical application.

When a girl you like is ignoring you, there are primarily two reasons for her behavior: either the ignoring is a test, or she perceives you as a guy with limited options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This article focuses on the latter, which is often the more common scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## Reasons a Girl Might Ignore You

### 1. The "Ignoring Test"

This type of ignoring typically occurs when a woman is already interested in you, such as after you've gone out with her, or if you previously sensed her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This specific scenario will be discussed further in a future video in this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

### 2. Perception of Limited Options

A woman might ignore you if she senses that you do not have many other options in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This often happens if you give her excessive attention, making her feel like she is your only pursuit and that you are willing to do anything to please her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This behavior can inadvertently communicate that you don't value yourself highly and that your primary goal is simply to get her notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

If a girl was not interested in you from the beginning and shows no signs of caring, it's highly probable that this is the reason for her ignoring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Common Mistakes to Avoid

A significant mistake some men make when perceived as having limited options is lying about having other women in their lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This approach, while seemingly logical, often leads to the opposite of the desired result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Lying is a major [[common_mistakes_men_make_when_a_woman_loses_interest | attraction killer]] for two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>:
*   **Discovery of Deceit:** She will likely discover the lie, which makes her feel that you are desperate for her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
*   **Seeking Approval:** Even if she doesn't explicitly catch you lying, she will understand that you are trying to convey that you have many options, which is a subtle form of seeking her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Seeking approval is one of the biggest mistakes you can make when attempting to [[avoiding_common_mistakes_when_attracting_women | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## The Qualifying Technique

Instead of fabricating options, the key is to interact with a woman in a way that *suggests* you have options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This can be achieved through a method called **qualifying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Qualifying means screening or filtering, which implies you have enough choices to need to sort through them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you subtly communicate that you have many options, as this is behavior typically exhibited by individuals who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This technique helps solidify a girl's [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | attraction]] and shifts the dynamic from casual flirting to genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The goal is to be the "chooser," not the "chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Qualifying makes her feel like you are choosing her over other girls, and that she is impressing you, not just based on her looks, but on who she is as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If you don't qualify her, she might assume you're simply trying to "get into her pants" or that you lack options and would accept any girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. However, when you qualify her, she perceives you as choosy because you have options, and that you've selected her for a specific, meaningful reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Ways to Qualify a Girl

Here are three effective ways to qualify a girl and make her feel special and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>:

#### 1. The Qualifying Question

Ask a question that encourages her to reveal positive qualities about herself, and then acknowledge those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Example:** "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason, I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you, and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
    *   This prompts her to think about what will make you like her more, leading her to "sell herself" to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. When you accept her answer (e.g., "Wow, that's really cool, I like that about you"), she feels more special and genuinely appreciated for who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.
*   **Another Example:** "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to, and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>
    *   Always accept what she tells you to avoid making her feel rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This makes her feel she won you over with her personality, not just her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This is especially impactful for attractive women who are tired of being valued only for their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've noticed in her, then invite her to confirm it with a question that encourages a "yes" answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. When she agrees, she will start to act more consistently with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Example:** "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open, and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   The key is to make it a genuine statement she'll feel good confirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. She'll feel you recognize something unique and valuable about her, fostering a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Another Example:** "You know what I like about you? You're so bold, like you don't filter yourself at all. You just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing, it makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
    *   Making it open-ended and positive, yet vague enough not to be definitively disproven, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. By accepting her into this positive frame, she begins to embody that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This can lead to her opening up and feeling emotionally close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

    Good qualities to look for include: open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, and easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. For attractive women, noting their intelligence can be very impactful, as they often wish more people would recognize their intellect over their beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

#### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself

Often, girls will try to qualify themselves to you without prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This happens when she:
*   Brags or shares things about herself hoping for your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Shows positive body language, like facing you or getting close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touches you or shows direct interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asks if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Shows off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you notice a girl attempting to impress you or gain your liking, acknowledge her efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is cool, express that you like her, or use physical touch like putting your arm around her to show acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. If you fail to acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, when you accept her, she'll feel great and continue to try and win you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

This strategy extends beyond romantic interactions; acknowledging what you appreciate about others makes them feel seen and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

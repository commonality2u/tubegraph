Many men apologize unnecessarily, even for trivial matters or when they've done nothing wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:48">[04:37:48]</a>. This often stems from a desire to appear agreeable or to avoid conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. However, constantly apologizing without cause can lead to a loss of a man's perceived power and, consequently, a woman's respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. Before apologizing, it's crucial to ask yourself, "Did I actually do something wrong?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## When You Are at Fault

There are three main types of situations when you might be at fault, each requiring a different approach to apologizing:

### Situation 1: You didn't do anything wrong, but she's upset

In this scenario, if you haven't made a mistake but your actions or words have upset her, do not apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Instead, [[techniques_for_emotional_framing_in_relationships | tease her a little and joke around]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### Situation 2: You made a small mistake

This applies to minor errors within an established relationship, such as forgetting a small gift or her birthday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Your apology should be brief; simply say "sorry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. After apologizing, give her some space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. Avoid begging for forgiveness, as this can be a "trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Allow her to come back to you naturally when she is ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

### Situation 3: You made a big mistake

For very serious, potentially unforgivable mistakes like cheating, it is appropriate to go out of your way to apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This can include buying her a gift or going to her place to express your regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

## When She Is at Fault

Just as important as knowing when to apologize is knowing how to react when she makes a mistake.

### Situation 1: Minor fault

If she says something that upsets you, do not show any reaction, anger, or drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. As a man, you shouldn't be full of drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Situation 2: You should hold her accountable

When she makes a mistake, even a minor one, do not get angry, but hold her accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. For example, if she cancels a planned date at the last minute, you might say, "You're messing up your chances with me," and hang up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>. If she calls back to apologize, you can set a consequence, such as requesting an apology letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. If she refuses, end the interaction calmly and don't contact her again until she reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This approach demonstrates control and that her actions have consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

### Situation 3: Big mistake (e.g., cheating)

For a major mistake like cheating, you should not get angry, but you must end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. Forgiving her in such a situation will permanently diminish her respect for you, and she will never love you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. She may only stay to exploit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.

## General Advice

*   **Don't get mad or upset:** Never let a woman's actions make you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. If you react with anger, it shows she is in control of your emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Even if she says nasty things, remain calm and composed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>.
*   **Act like nothing gets to you:** Be like "The Rock in the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Often, a woman might be testing your reaction to extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. If you react predictably, you fail the test, lose your power, and lose her [[difference_between_types_of_respect_in_romantic_contexts | respect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
*   **Speak through your actions, not words:** When addressing issues or setting boundaries, don't engage in lengthy debates or justifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. Your actions should convey your message more effectively than words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>. This relates to [[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | maintaining control]] in the relationship.
*   **Avoid sacrificing for a girl:** The idea of sacrificing for a girl, often seen in media, doesn't work in real relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Sacrificing your happiness or hobbies can lead to being placed in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. A girl should never be the reason for you to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

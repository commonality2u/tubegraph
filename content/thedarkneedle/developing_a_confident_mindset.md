Cultivating a confident mindset is foundational for attracting women and living a fulfilling life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This approach focuses on developing your inner self and personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Core Mindset Principles

### Belief in Self-Worth
A man must believe he deserves anything that exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This means not telling yourself you don't deserve a certain job or that a woman is "out of your league" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This belief is a significant sign of strength that makes a woman attached to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Intrinsic Value and Boundaries
Believe that you possess intrinsic value and do not allow your worth to be diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. If someone disrespects or insults you, you must stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. A woman's attraction to you will significantly increase if she sees you standing up for yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This also applies to women: if a woman disrespects you, set boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Confidence in Decision-Making
When you make a decision, assume it is the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This mindset exudes [[confidence_in_social_interactions | confidence]] and makes a woman highly attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Whatever choice you make, do not hesitate; act with certainty and without seeking approval or opinion from the woman you are with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.

### Assuming Mutual Attraction
Believe that any girl you are attracted to is also attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This is a crucial principle for navigating the dating world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Always assume and communicate that the girl you are talking to is attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This concept has been explained in detail within the "how to attract women" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Confident Behaviors

Beyond mindset, certain behaviors demonstrate confidence and attract women.

### Having a Plan and Goal in Life
An ambitious man working towards a goal is far more attractive than someone who has already achieved all their goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Whether it's training for a perfect physique or working on a side hustle, you need to have something to focus on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. A woman needs to feel that you are heading somewhere and that she is coming along with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. If you lack a goal, a woman may become the center of your world, which is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

To demonstrate this:
*   Make your goal more important than her, at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. For example, prioritize work or gym over immediate requests to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Always stay busy with something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Even if stable or married, set and work towards goals to maintain attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This is a common reason for divorce or infidelity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   Understand that if a woman tries to mock or discourage your goal, it's a test of your strength. Do not let her succeed, but also do not get angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Ability to Ask for What You Want
This is one of the most attractive traits to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Whether ordering food, asking a taxi driver to open a window, or requesting a raise at work, confidently ask for what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Do not underestimate these small actions, as they play a significant role in attracting a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. It's not a problem if your request is denied; the important thing is that you asked for what you wanted and you should not feel embarrassed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Ability to Handle Failure
This trait is ingrained in human genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Women are attracted to a man who can overcome failure, fall, and then rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This ability has a magical, almost unnatural effect on women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

To demonstrate this:
*   Learn to express your failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, for example, by telling her about a job interview you failed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   Do not show discouragement or loss of hope. If you are not accepted, immediately apply to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   If you make a mistake in a relationship, face it, talk about it, and work on resolving the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Women are naturally wired to be attracted to a man who faces challenges and solves problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   Never remain stuck when you fail. Do not give up at the first sign of failure, complain, or cry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Pick yourself up and rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   Do not be ashamed of showing your failure, as it is a natural part of life, not a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. When a woman sees you can handle failure, she feels safe and attached to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

### Not Being in a Rush
In a relationship with a woman, you should never appear hurried or overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Do not rush into a relationship or try to sleep with her quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Remain calm and take your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Women are attracted to men who are composed, deliberate, and patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

Focus on making conversations emotional and engaging, rather than just ordinary or lengthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Five minutes of exciting interaction are far better than five hours of monotony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The key is to trigger her emotions to maintain interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

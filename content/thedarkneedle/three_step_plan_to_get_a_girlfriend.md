This article outlines a three-step plan designed to help attract a girlfriend from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Each step aims to progress the interaction to the next level by influencing the emotional dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Step One: Make Her Surrender to Your Emotional Frame

The first step involves making a woman surrender to your emotional frame through a technique called "Your Trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

### The "Your Trouble" Technique
This technique involves labeling her in a way that takes power away from her, rather than giving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Many men approach women seeking to be liked, appearing safe, friendly, or attractive, which women are accustomed to and expect to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. They have practiced flirting, playing innocent, and being mysterious since a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

By saying "You're trouble" calmly and confidently, not jokingly or with "puppy eyes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>, you put her on the defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This subtly implies she is dangerous and that you should be careful with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This shifts the energy from "I hope she likes me" to "she has to prove she's not chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Women inherently desire men who can see through their usual patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Signaling "I see your game and I'm not playing it" disarms her, interrupts her social autopilot, and forces her to react to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

The phrase "You're trouble" is open-ended, allowing her brain to spin trying to fill in the blanks about what kind of trouble she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This creates a psychological itch that she feels compelled to scratch, making her want to know how you see her and to regain control of the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. The moment she starts defending herself or trying to shape your perception, she has lost the frame and is doing the chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. When a woman is focused on how a man sees her, she is no longer in control of the power dynamic and is inside your emotional frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Application of the Technique

This technique is applied in two stages:

1.  **First 5-10 minutes**: Deliver the phrase early in the conversation, before she establishes a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   **When to say it**: When she flirts too easily, smiles like she's done it many times, asks too many questions too fast, or acts performatively innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Look at her calmly, smirk, then say, "You're trouble. I can already tell," then remain silent without laughing or explaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
    *   **As a pattern break**: Use it when she expects a compliment, for example, after she shows a cute photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. Instead of "You look good," say, "Yeah, that confirms it. You're definitely trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Women are used to predictable patterns, and this phrase forces them to adjust in real-time, revealing their true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   **Her Reactions**:
        *   **Pushing back**: If she says, "No, I'm not," or "Wow, rude," it means your words pierced her surface, and she's emotionally invested in defending her image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This is desired as it makes her fight to change your perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
        *   **Playing along**: If she says, "Maybe I am," or "Only when I'm bored," a slight smirk from you and silence is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This gives her a new identity she'll feel around you, shaping her behavior and keeping you in control of the emotional rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

2.  **Reuse Later**: Re-use the phrase later when she reveals something unhinged, emotional, or gives a glimpse of her real nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Say it quietly and calmly, like, "See, told you trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. After the second time, she may start calling herself that, internalizing the label and emotionally surrendering to your frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

This first step initiates the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Step Two: Keep the Chase Going (Create Craving)

Once the chasing begins, the second step is to maintain it by creating craving, using the technique "I like this, whatever this is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### The "I Like This, Whatever This Is" Technique
When she starts opening up, leaning in, and trying to show her depth or uniqueness, you use this phrase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This rewards her emotionally ("I like this") but keeps her chasing clarity ("whatever this is"), implying she's gotten through a layer but without full definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

You plant the idea of something special happening, then pull away before she can grasp it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The "I like this" part shows warmth and emotion, while "whatever this is" refuses to define the relationship, creating emotional tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This mix of warmth and confusion is a powerful emotional cocktail that can create obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Her brain gets stuck in a loop, trying to understand the nature of the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

By not shutting her down or overcommitting, you give her emotional weight without structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This leads her to question her feelings, your intensity, and ultimately feel a need to find out what "this" is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. When she falls into this state, you begin to take over her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### Application of the Technique
This line must be earned and delivered at the right moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Timing**: The sweet spot is when emotional tension has built up enough, but it's not yet romantic, though undeniably charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Say it in a moment of natural intimacy, like when you're laughing together, vibing, or sitting closer than before, and she's getting comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   After a long laugh and brief silence, exhale, glance, smirk a little, and casually say, "I like this, whatever this is," then immediately look away or change the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   After she shares something real, emotional, or vulnerable, let it breathe, pause, look at her, and say, "You know, I like this, whatever this is," then go quiet for a second and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Delivery**: The delivery is key, not the words themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Don't be serious or make it a speech; act like it just slipped out, as if you were surprised by your own honesty but too composed to make it a big deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The goal is to make her *feel* something, then pull away before she gets emotional closure, creating a "warm and cold" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Your energy should convey that you felt something but won't make a big deal out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This subtle detachment makes the line powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Her Reaction**: She might pause, smile, or pretend it didn't land, but later, when you're gone, she will replay that moment in her head and discuss it with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This turns a simple sentence into a "mind virus" that makes her yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. She starts watching you differently, replaying the vibe, and seeing you two as "something undefined but real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. This uncertainty becomes what she wants to escape, and you become the only one who can resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Step Three: Turn Her Confusion into Ownership

After creating craving, the third phase involves dropping a line that converts her confusion into a sense of ownership: "You already act like my girl sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### The "You Already Act Like My Girl Sometimes" Technique
By saying this, you assign her the girlfriend role, but only partially, to create tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. You imply she's already behaving as someone emotionally attached, but without the title, which exposes behavior she didn't mean to admit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Her mind races, wondering if she acts that way and what it means <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This initiates a mild emotional spiral, and once she reflects on her behavior, she's in the trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This is an example of [[steps_to_influence_someones_behavior | influencing someone's behavior]].

*   **Her Reactions**:
    *   **Pushing back**: If she says, "No, I don't," she comes off as cold or disconnected, denying something she knows feels true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This creates tension within her, an emotional imbalance she'll likely lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
    *   **Agreeing**: If she agrees, even jokingly ("haha, shut up, yeah, maybe I do"), she's admitting to being attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This means she's stepped directly into the frame you gave her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

You are not asking her to be your girlfriend or even stating that you want her to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. You are simply implying that you've noticed she has already slipped into that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Her brain then scans her past behavior, confirming if she has been acting like your girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. If she starts playing into it by being more nurturing, jealous, or consistent, it feels to her like she's merely following through on who she already was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. She won't realize you made her see it that way; she'll think she came to that conclusion herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. You are [[steps_to_influence_someones_behavior | installing the behavior]] by telling her she's already doing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Application of the Technique
This line should be delivered after some form of emotional behavior from her that resembles girlfriend behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

*   **Delivery**: Say it like a calm observation, with a slight smirk, playful but not silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Drop it into the conversation as if it wasn't meant to be deep, but let it land heavily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. It must be said *after* she does something emotional, not before, to avoid sounding like you're leading her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Examples**:
    *   If she gets annoyed at you for not replying, smile, shake your head slowly, and say, "You already act like my girl sometimes," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. She won't expect you to notice, and she'll feel caught <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   If she does something nurturing or domestic (folds your shirt, brings food, comments on your health), look at her with amused disbelief and say, "You're aware you're acting like my girl right now," then let her react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Tone**: Never say this in a needy way or while trying to get her to be your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. You're teasing her, but underneath the tease is a truth she can't deny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The moment she starts defending, joking, or playing into it, the frame has landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. She begins to think about her role in your life, using words like "we" or "already" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Once a woman accepts a label in her own mind, she's no longer deciding whether to be with you; she's waiting for you to match the label <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. You didn't chase her; you led her there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

In summary, the first phrase creates tension, the second creates a bond, and the third gives her the illusion of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This process creates an emotional loop she doesn't realize she's stepping into, and by the time she's caught, she's already calling herself yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

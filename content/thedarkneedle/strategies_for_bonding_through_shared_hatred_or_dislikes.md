Attraction can be accelerated by understanding how the human brain processes information. Our brains react more strongly to negatives than to positives, being programmed to run away from danger rather than to seek out something good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. This principle can be applied to forming connections and building attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>.

Instead of only searching for common interests, a more effective and faster way to build attraction is by finding something you both dislike or hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. From experience, this has proven to be one of the most effective methods for women to feel a strong attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

## Methods of Bonding Through Shared Dislike

Shared hatred can manifest in various forms:

### Common Enemy
A shared hatred can involve a [[using_common_enemies_to_build_attraction | common enemy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. This could be:
*   A dislike for social media and how it makes people superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   A shared frustration with how dating apps have complicated relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

Historically, a common enemy has been one of the most powerful ways to form alliances and attract people to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

To leverage this, consider asking questions like: "What is the thing you hate the most?" or "Who is your enemy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a> If you share the same dislike, express your feelings about it passionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.

### Shared Dislike of a Person
People tend to bond more over individuals they dislike than those they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. If you and another person both dislike the same individual—such as a boss, a teacher, or an annoying customer—it can quickly create a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

If someone is uncomfortable sharing their dislikes directly, encourage them to talk about why they hate someone or something. Listen carefully and observe their passionate and emotional expression of that hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This approach can save significant time in building rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.

### "Us Against Them" Dynamic (Partners in Crime)
A powerful technique for shared hatred is creating a "You and Me Against the World" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This involves:
*   Secretly pranking co-workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   Having inside jokes about certain customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.
*   Engaging in lighthearted mischief where you and the other person get in trouble together, then bonding by talking negatively about the authority figure (e.g., a boss) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
The goal is to establish an "us against them" frame in your interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.

### Simple Dislikes
Shared hatred doesn't always have to be profound. It can be something as simple as:
*   A food you both dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.
*   A city you both find boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.
*   A TV show or movie you both consider terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
Simply discuss the disliked thing and express your mutual aversion to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

All these methods use the human instinct of bonding through negative emotions to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

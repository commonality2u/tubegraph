This article explores how to shift social dynamics, particularly in dating, so that a woman seeks a man's approval rather than the other way around. It highlights key mindset adjustments and behavioral rules derived from understanding the inherent drive for validation.

## The Instinctive Need for Approval

Women share a common trait: a deep-seated instinct to gain the approval of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This trait is rooted in their genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. From a young age, girls are exposed to advertising focused on appearance, spending hours and money on beauty products and makeup, all stemming from this desire for external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

For a man, understanding and feeding this instinct means the woman becomes interested in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. If you can make a woman strive to gain your approval, she will be attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This principle is considered "the key to every girl's heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. It's an easy process because the instinct is already present within her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>, similar to how ads can easily influence women to spend on beauty products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Fundamental Mindset in Relationships

Relationships are primarily governed by [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | emotion]], not logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Therefore, the first crucial step is that you should **not** try to impress the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. One of the most attractive traits a man can possess is not being overly concerned with [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | gaining her approval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The challenge many men face is an internal pressure to impress, especially if they are not used to frequently talking to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Modern society has placed a high value on women, leading men to subconsciously feel she is "better" and that her approval must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Overcoming Internal Pressure

To counteract this subconscious programming, you must first acknowledge the internal pressure that drives you to seek a girl's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. When talking to an attractive woman, become aware of this feeling of wanting to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Acknowledging it is the first step to controlling its direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Mindset Shift
> Instead of trying to change the *action* (e.g., stopping yourself from talking about your achievements), you must redirect the *pressure* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. When you feel the urge to impress her, tell yourself: "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This shift in [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | mindset]] will help you overcome the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. With practice, this process becomes automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. By not seeking her approval, you create the space for her to want to gain yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## The Recipe: Not Giving Validation + Expressing Preferences

To make a girl seek your approval, the recipe involves two key ingredients:
1.  **Not giving her validation immediately** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
2.  **Telling her what you like in a girl's personality and appearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

Since a woman inherently craves admiration and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, you must not give it to her easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. If you immediately validate her (e.g., by liking every social media post or appearing obsessed), it "ends the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

When you hold back validation and simultaneously state your preferences, her internal instincts kick in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. She'll begin to think: "Why isn't he giving me validation? I need to make him admire me. How? I have to do what he said he likes in other girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. She then starts doing things you like, automatically entering a state where she's trying to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Conditions for Applying the Recipe

To effectively apply this "recipe," several rules must be followed:

#### 1. The 40/60 Rule of Preferences
When you state your preferences (e.g., liking girls who wear dresses, are introverted, or don't wear too much makeup), a small portion of what you like (around **40%**) should already be present in her, while **60%** should not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This prevents you from appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

An attractive girl typically receives validation for almost anything she does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. By withholding validation when she does something common (like wearing a shirt) and giving it only when she aligns with your specific preferences (like wearing a dress), you influence her to seek *your* unique approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

#### 2. Speak Generally and Express Opinion Only
When expressing what you like, speak in a general way, reflecting only your opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Do not follow up with direct commands like "you should cut your hair" or "wear green" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Never imply that she needs to do these things to be accepted by you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Your words should convey that you are merely expressing your opinion, nothing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. The ability to express yourself effectively is a key charismatic skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

When she hears your general preferences (e.g., "I don't like girls who smoke" or "I like organized people"), she will internally apply it to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. She'll connect your lack of interest or validation to her not possessing those qualities, prompting her to adopt them to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

#### 3. Do Not React to Everything

Do not react to a girl simply because she says or does something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. For example, if she tells a dull or boring joke, do not laugh just because she's beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. While you might logically worry about her embarrassment, a slight discomfort can actually make her more attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Golden Advice
> Never let a girl feel that anything she does will impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Always convey that your admiration requires unique and exceptional qualities in her personality or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. If she says something genuinely good, reacting is fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

#### 4. Approach with Curiosity, Not Admiration

When asking questions or trying to get to know a girl, your demeanor should reflect curiosity, not admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Act as if you haven't yet decided whether you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This should be evident in your body language and tone; avoid overly eager smiles or enthusiastic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Focus on changing your internal intention to pure curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

**Avoiding Interrogation**: Never put yourself in a position where a girl interrogates you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. If she starts asking a series of questions that put you on the spot, you risk giving her control and allowing her to judge you, which goes against natural dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. You are the man, and you are the chooser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. If this happens, deflect with short answers like "it's a long story," "take a guess," or shift the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This is an [[avoiding_common_social_mistakes | important social mistake to avoid]].

#### 5. Don't Match Her Attempts to Impress

If a girl starts trying to win your approval by highlighting her positive traits (e.g., "I practice Taekwondo," "I love kids," "I read books"), avoid the instinctive urge to match her by sharing similar achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. If you do, you deny her the opportunity to strive for your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Instead, either comment casually or, ideally, make it seem like you are **bad** at the thing she's trying to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. For example, if she says, "I practice Taekwondo," you could say, "I tried it once and I almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. If she mentions excellent grades in math, you could say, "Well, I was terrible at math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This creates space for her to impress you and demonstrate her capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

By combining and applying these mindset adjustments and behavioral rules, you can create a strong desire in a woman to win your approval, leading her to actively try to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

When pursuing women, it's crucial to understand the subtle art of [[balanding_interest_and_indifference_in_interactions | balancing interest and disinterest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Many individuals mistakenly believe that acting completely disinterested is the key, but this often comes across as rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. The goal is to show a *bit* of interest, followed by a *bit* of disinterest, never complete disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

## Why Balance is Key
A woman will not stay interested if you consistently show complete disinterest, as it suggests you are telling her to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Instead, the approach should be to demonstrate your interest, but simultaneously communicate that you won't chase her for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This creates a dynamic where she feels acknowledged yet also understands you possess [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | self-respect and boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## How to Apply the Balance
The recommended pattern is to express one line that indicates interest and another line that shows a slight disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Correct Application
An example of correctly applying this balance is: "You look cute in this dress, but pink would have been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   "You look cute in this dress" shows active interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   "But pink would have been better" conveys a subtle hint of disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Incorrect Application
Conversely, an incorrect way that comes across as rude is: "This dress isn't looking good on you, you should have tried pink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This sentence displays disinterest twice and can be perceived as a direct insult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Maintaining this balance helps prevent you from [[avoiding_being_boring_and_predictable_with_women | appearing too eager or approval-seeking]], which can be an "attraction killer" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Women are drawn to a challenge and won't find you one if you constantly agree or appear desperate for their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This approach is key to keeping the attraction present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

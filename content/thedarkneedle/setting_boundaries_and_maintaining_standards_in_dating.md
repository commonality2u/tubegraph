Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose the woman herself and yourself in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. To maintain respect and strong relationships, it's crucial to avoid certain common mistakes.

## 1. Distinguishing Between Seeking Approval and Seeking Advice

Women inherently love to help and find offering support to be a strong way to bond emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Asking for advice is an effective way to create a connection, whether short-term or long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, many men mistakenly ask for advice in a way that appears to be seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### The Pitfall of Seeking Approval
While it's not wrong to ask for a partner's opinion, especially on matters affecting both of you, the problem lies in the underlying motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Many men ask not to genuinely hear an opinion, but to be reassured they are making the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Phrases like "What do you think if I go out with the guys tonight?" or "Do you think I should accept this opportunity?" can subtly convey, "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

When decisions are made based on fear of her reaction rather than personal values and principles, women quickly notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. If your decisions are based on pleasing her, she becomes the center of your life, and her respect for you begins to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This also makes you more predictable and easier to manipulate, which women may unconsciously test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Leadership in Decision-Making
For personal life decisions, such as travel or going out with friends, do not ask for her opinion or wait for her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

For decisions involving both of you, demonstrate leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. If you suggest an activity (e.g., movies) and she suggests an alternative (e.g., pool), going along with her suggestion means she becomes the leader, and you lose her respect and your leadership position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Instead, respectfully refuse her suggestion and state your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If she continues to oppose, you must be prepared to go alone, for example, "No, I don't want to go to the pool, but if you want to go, go ahead. I'll go to the movies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Over time, this approach can lead her to accept your leadership and follow your initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Her emotions should not control your life; she expects you to be the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## 2. Avoiding the Expectation of Rejection

Sending signals that you expect rejection, such as discussing a picture she posted with another guy or why she didn't reply to your message, is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This behavior implies a lack of [[strategies_for_maintaining_confidence_and_selfworth_in_dating | confidence]] in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### The "Golden Rule" of Confidence
All girls, universally, love to give the impression that you haven't impacted them yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. While she might show interest, it's rare for her to show early on that she's emotionally attached or desires a serious relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This is often an unconscious test to see if you'll lose self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. If you get upset because she didn't respond, she gains power over you, diminishing her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. You must outpower her in this area by maintaining your strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

When a girl rejects you or gives the impression she doesn't want you, remember she's likely testing your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Do not discuss these behaviors with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### When to Walk Away
While some testing is unconscious, be aware of girls who do this excessively, constantly trying to make you jealous or lying frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If a girl starts testing you disrespectfully or tactlessly, especially early in the interaction without an established relationship, recognize this as a sign of a toxic, manipulative "drama queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

You don't need to play her game or try to outsmart her to build attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Doing so lowers your standards and attracts the same type of woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Manipulative men attract drama queens, and "nice guys" attract bossy, gold-digging, or controlling women due to a lack of [[setting_boundaries_in_relationships | boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

By [[being_assertive_and_setting_boundaries | setting clear boundaries]] and maintaining strong standards, you signal that you know what you want and are prepared to walk away from anything that doesn't match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Having high standards attracts a high-quality woman who wants the same things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Remember, "You don't attract what you want. You attract what you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## 3. Avoiding Leaning on Her Too Soon

Leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction for you is a guaranteed way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While showing vulnerability can build intimacy, it becomes emotional suicide if the proper foundation isn't established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. A woman needs a certain level of certainty and trust before you should reveal your most vulnerable side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Earning Her Support
Women are nurturing and supportive by nature, but this support must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. A high-quality woman will stand by her man if he has proven himself worthy of her support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If you lean on her before she is fully sure about you, she may perceive it as weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. If your strength isn't established, fear and anxiety may creep into her mind, leading her to test you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

An example from a women's dating advice website illustrates this: A young man displayed deep emotional weakness early in a budding relationship. Later, when he asked for her photo, she tested him by asking him to stay up all night waiting for a specific song on the radio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When he complied, she lost all attraction and broke up with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited until she was more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper side, she wouldn't have pushed him away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

In the early stages of a relationship, many women are not ready to handle the full spectrum of a man's emotional side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While men have insecurities and desire acceptance, exposing your soul to a woman who hasn't yet seen your strength and confidence can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

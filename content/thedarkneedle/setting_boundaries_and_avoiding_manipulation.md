Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose her and yourself. This article outlines three common mistakes that can prevent a man from gaining a woman's respect, emphasizing the importance of [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | setting boundaries]] and avoiding [[consequences_and_ethics_of_manipulative_behaviors_in_relationships | manipulative behaviors]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

## Mistake 1: Not Distinguishing Between Seeking Approval and Seeking Advice

Women inherently enjoy helping and bonding emotionally through giving support. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a> Asking a girl for advice can be a quick way to create a connection, whether short-term or long-term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> However, many men mistakenly ask for advice in a way that suggests they are actually [[the_importance_of_avoiding_neediness_in_interactions | seeking approval]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>

### The Pitfall of Seeking Approval
When men ask for opinions not to hear genuine advice, but to be reassured they are making the right decision, they are subtly asking, "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> This shift means decisions are no longer based on personal values and principles, but on fear. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> Women quickly notice this, and once decisions are based on pleasing her, she becomes the center of your life. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a> Respect begins to erode the moment she perceives a need for her approval. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a> This also makes a man easier to [[consequences_and_ethics_of_manipulative_behaviors_in_relationships | manipulate]] and more predictable, which women may test, consciously or unconsciously. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

### Leadership in Shared Decisions
For personal decisions (e.g., traveling or going out with friends), a man's choices should not be based on a woman's happiness or require her approval. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> For decisions involving both partners, a man must differentiate between a leader and a follower. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

Consider this "golden piece of advice":
If you suggest an activity, like going to the movies, and she suggests an alternative, like the pool, accepting her alternative makes her the leader. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a> While she might seem happy in the moment, you risk losing her respect and your leadership position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>

Instead, refuse the alternative and reiterate your preference. If she still insists on her choice, respectfully state your intention to proceed with your original plan, even if it means going alone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a> Over time, this approach can lead her to accept and follow your [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | leadership]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> A woman's emotions should not control a man's life or decisions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a> Being a leader means prioritizing your desires, as women subconsciously desire this strength. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>

## Mistake 2: Sending the Message That You Expect Her to Reject You

This mistake manifests when a man interprets a woman's actions (e.g., posting a picture with another guy, not replying to messages) as immediate rejection and then addresses these perceived rejections. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> This behavior sends a message that you expect her to reject you. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>

### The Golden Rule of Testing Confidence
It's a "golden rule" that all girls will, at some point, try to make it seem like you haven't impacted them, often to test your confidence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a> They might show interest but will avoid showing deep emotional attachment early on. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> This is an unconscious way for them to gauge if you will lose confidence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a> A woman wants a man who is strong; if she can easily upset you, she holds more power, making her less attracted. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>

The correct approach is to view these instances as tests of your confidence and not engage in discussion about them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a> Do not dwell on delayed replies, attempts to make you jealous, or discussions about her exes or celebrity crushes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

### When to Walk Away and [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | Set Boundaries]]
While some tests are unconscious, be aware of women who engage in exaggerated or consistently [[consequences_and_ethics_of_manipulative_behaviors_in_relationships | manipulative]] testing, such as constant jealousy-inducing behavior or lying. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a> If a woman displays disrespectful or tactless testing early in an interaction, particularly before a real connection is built, it's a sign of a potentially toxic, drama-prone, or [[consequences_and_ethics_of_manipulative_behaviors_in_relationships | manipulative]] personality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a> In such cases, [[avoiding_time_wasting_and_distractions | walk away]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>

Engaging in her games or trying to "outsmart" her lowers your [[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | standards]] and guarantees attracting the same type of woman. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a> By [[significance_of_maintaining_boundaries_and_principles | setting clear boundaries and strong standards]], you communicate that you know what you want and are prepared to walk away from anything that doesn't align with it. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a> Manipulative men attract drama queens, while "nice guys" attract controlling women because they lack boundaries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> Investing time in outsmarting a woman who insists on testing you early on is a waste if you seek a high-quality partner. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>

> "You don't attract what you want. You attract what you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>

## Mistake 3: Leaning Before It's Time

Leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction is a guaranteed way to lose her. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> While vulnerability can build intimacy, it's "emotional suicide" if the proper foundation hasn't been established. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a> A woman needs a certain level of certainty and trust before a man reveals his most vulnerable side. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>

Women are naturally nurturing, but their support must be earned. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a> A high-quality woman will stand by her man if he has proven himself worthy of her support. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> Showing weakness too early, before she is fully sure about you, can trigger fear and anxiety in her mind, potentially leading her to [[developing_emotional_independence_in_relationships | test you]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a> She may test to determine if that moment of weakness was isolated or part of your recurring personality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>

### The Cost of Premature Vulnerability
An example from a dating advice website illustrates this: a high school girl lost attraction for a young man who broke down crying about his father's funeral early in their budding relationship. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> Feeling unsettled by his emotional display, she later tested him by asking him to stay up all night for a song on the radio in exchange for a photo. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> When he fell for the trap, she lost all attraction and broke up with him. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>

Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited until she was more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper side, she might not have pushed him away. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a> In early relationship stages, many women are not ready for the full spectrum of a man's emotional side. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> Exposing your soul to a woman who hasn't yet seen your strength and confidence can backfire. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>

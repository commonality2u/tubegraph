Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose her and yourself [00:00:00]. Several common mistakes can lead to losing respect and confidence in relationships.

## Avoid Seeking Approval Instead of Advice

One common mistake is failing to distinguish between seeking approval and genuinely seeking advice [00:00:09]. While women enjoy helping and bond emotionally through giving support, many men ask for advice in a way that suggests they are actually seeking approval [00:00:17].

Asking a girl for advice can quickly create a connection [00:00:32]. However, the problem arises when men ask for opinions not to genuinely hear them, but to be reassured they are making the right decision [00:01:11]. This often manifests as phrasing like, "What do you think if I go out with the guys tonight?" [00:01:17], which secretly conveys, "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" [00:01:24].

When decisions are based on fear of her reaction rather than personal values and principles, a man loses respect [00:01:31]. Women quickly notice when a man's decisions are based on pleasing them, causing respect to diminish as she perceives a need for her approval [00:01:36]. This also makes a man easier to manipulate and more predictable, which women may test [00:01:55].

The key is to ask for her opinion because you genuinely want it, not because you fear her reaction [00:02:08]. Your personal decisions, such as travel plans or going out with friends, should not be based on her happiness or require her approval [00:02:13].

## Embrace Leadership in Shared Decisions

In situations involving shared decisions, such as choosing an activity together, the man should demonstrate leadership [00:02:42]. If you suggest an activity (e.g., movies) and she proposes another (e.g., pool), going with her preference means you've allowed her to become the leader, leading to a loss of respect [00:02:47].

Instead, refuse her alternative and reiterate your original preference [00:03:10]. If she insists on her choice, respectfully state that you don't want to do her activity, but she is free to go if she wishes, while you will proceed with your plan alone [00:03:17]. Over time, this approach can lead her to accept your leadership and follow you [00:03:26]. Her emotions should not control your life or dictate your desires [00:04:02]. A woman desires a man who is a leader [00:04:00].

## Avoid Signaling Expectation of Rejection

Another mistake is conveying the message that you expect a woman to reject you [00:04:07]. Examples include bringing up her social media posts with other men or questioning her about delayed message replies [00:04:11]. Such actions communicate an anticipation of rejection [00:04:26].

A crucial rule to remember is that most women love to make you feel like you haven't yet impacted them [00:04:43]. They may show interest but will generally not reveal early on that they are emotionally attached or seeking a serious relationship [00:04:50]. This behavior is often an unconscious test of your [[Confidence and decisionmaking in relationships | confidence]] [00:05:00]. If you get upset because she didn't respond, it implies she has more power than you, which is not attractive [00:05:16]. She seeks strength, meaning you need to demonstrate it [00:05:21].

To navigate this, adopt the mindset that if a woman rejects you or implies she doesn't want you, she is likely testing your [[Confidence and decisionmaking in relationships | confidence]] [00:05:31]. Never discuss these perceived rejections with her [00:05:47]. If she delays replies, tries to make you jealous, or talks about exes or celebrity crushes, do not focus on it or engage in discussion about it [00:05:50].

While this behavior is often unconscious, men should be aware of women who exhibit it in an exaggerated or manipulative way [00:06:01]. If a woman tests you disrespectfully or tactlessly early in an interaction, and there's no established relationship, it's a sign of potential toxicity or manipulation [00:06:25]. While you could play her game, doing so lowers your [[Strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships | standards]] and attracts similar types of women [00:06:44].

[[Setting boundaries and avoiding manipulation | Setting clear boundaries and maintaining strong standards]] signals that you know what you want and are prepared to walk away from anything that doesn't align with it [00:06:54]. Manipulative men attract drama queens, and "nice guys" attract controlling women because they lack boundaries [00:07:05]. Focusing on outsmarting a woman who insists on testing you early on is a waste of time if you're seeking a high-quality partner [00:07:16]. You attract what you are, so having high [[Strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships | standards]] increases the likelihood of attracting a high-quality woman [00:07:22].

## Understand Timing for Emotional Vulnerability

The third mistake is leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction for you [00:07:33]. While vulnerability can build intimacy, it's emotional suicide if a proper foundation of certainty and trust hasn't been established [00:07:46].

Women are nurturing by nature, but their support must be earned [00:07:59]. A high-quality woman will support her man if he has proven himself worthy [00:08:04]. Leaning on a woman too early, before she is fully sure about you, can be perceived as weakness [00:08:12]. If your strength and [[Confidence and decisionmaking in relationships | confidence]] haven't been established, showing vulnerability can trigger fear and anxiety in her, potentially prompting her to test you [00:08:17]. These tests determine whether your weakness was an isolated incident or a recurring part of your personality [00:08:29].

An example from a dating advice website illustrates this: A high school boy revealed his deep emotional pain about his father's funeral to a girl he was interested in, breaking down crying [00:08:47]. Although she sympathized, she felt unsettled by his early emotional display [00:09:00]. When he later asked for a photo, she tested him by demanding he stay up all night waiting for a specific song on the radio, promising the picture as a reward [00:09:23]. He complied, and she lost all attraction, breaking up with him days later [00:09:31]. Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited for her to be more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper side, she wouldn't have pushed him away [00:09:37].

In the early stages of a relationship, some women are not ready to handle the full spectrum of a man's emotional side [00:09:47]. While men desire a woman who accepts their insecurities, exposing your soul before she has witnessed your strength and [[Confidence and decisionmaking in relationships | confidence]] can backfire [00:09:52].

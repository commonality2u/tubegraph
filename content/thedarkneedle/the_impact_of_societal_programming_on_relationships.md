Traditional societal narratives often train individuals, particularly men, to view romantic partners as the ultimate goal or reward for personal achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This widespread conditioning significantly shapes how relationships are approached and can lead to ineffective dating strategies.

## The "Main Character" vs. "Side Quest" Mindset

The prevalent societal message, reinforced by media like movies where the hero's ultimate reward is often a woman, and social media influencers who display women as symbols of their success, brainwashes people into believing that a woman is the reward for hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This mindset suggests that actions like making money or building one's body are primarily for the purpose of "getting a woman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This ingrained belief places women on a high pedestal, preventing individuals from seeing them as simply a "side quest" in their own life story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A common mistake derived from this societal programming is making the girl the "main character" in one's own life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. For example, the speaker recounts an experience where he researched a girl's master's degree in rehabilitation sciences to impress her and initiate conversation, only to be completely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His error was talking about something *she* liked, which made him appear to be seeking her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Instead, an effective mindset to adopt is: "I am the main character. She's just a side quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. In this view, a woman is seen as a side character whose role is to add enjoyment to one's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Communication Strategies to Counter Societal Programming

To overcome the pitfalls of societal programming in [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | dating]], specific communication strategies can be employed:

### Choosing the Topic and Focus
When two people are conversing, the one with more perceived value is typically the one who chooses the topic of conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Many individuals mistakenly try to discover a girl's interests and then talk about those things to impress her, which often leads to being "friend-zoned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Instead, talk about something *you* enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This doesn't mean talking *about* yourself exclusively, but rather about topics you genuinely care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. The best approach is to speak about emotions, not just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, instead of discussing gym nutrition science, ask why someone enjoys training and talk about the emotions behind working out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. The core principle is never to talk about something you don't care about simply to impress someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Demonstrating Self-Sufficiency
Always remind yourself that you don't need to prove anything to a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This conveys that she is not the most important thing in your life and not the main character in your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

For instance:
*   If she claims you're lying about a story, agree and laugh: "Yes, I'm a liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   If she calls you stupid, agree: "Yeah, I'm stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   View her as an "NPC" (Non-Player Character) in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   If she interrupts you, don't try to finish your sentence or return to the topic. Just let her talk and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This indicates that her opinion isn't paramount to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

The underlying message is: "Whether people listen to me or not, I'll still be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Complete Honesty
Honesty is a powerful tool for forming connections and making a girl attached to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. The person in a lower position is often the one who lies, fearing the other's opinion or needing their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Therefore, never lie to a girl; always convey honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Attractive women, having experienced many interactions, often assume men will lie at some point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When they encounter genuine honesty, it creates a powerful impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

To demonstrate honesty, especially under pressure:
*   Share stories that might make you look bad. For instance, admitting you lost a fight or were beaten up makes it more believable that you're being truthful, as there's no logical reason to invent an embarrassing story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows honesty even when it's unflattering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   A compelling example involved a student who, when asked why he worked out, honestly replied "to get girls," causing both the coach and a girl listening to laugh and open a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This unvarnished truth conveyed confidence and that he didn't care about her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   Be honest even if it means delivering an unfavorable opinion, such as telling a girl an outfit doesn't look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Being honest in situations that put you under pressure shows that you are the main character and are extremely confident, caring little about what she thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the [[role_expectations_in_relationships | role expectations]] often imposed by societal programming.

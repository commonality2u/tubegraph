Attracting women is a skill that can be learned, and lack of success in dating often stems from a lack of knowledge, not personal flaws in appearance or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Understanding how women think and applying specific strategies can lead to effortless attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## The Friend Zone Phenomenon

One significant reason for failure in dating is falling into the [[avoiding_awkward_silences_and_the_friend_zone | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. A common misconception, often portrayed in romantic movies, is that becoming a good friend first will eventually lead to a romantic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### The Reality of the Friend Zone

In reality, once a man is in the [[avoiding_awkward_silences_and_the_friend_zone | friend zone]], a woman will almost never see him as a potential romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Instead, she will treat him like "one of her girlfriends in mail form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Attempting to make a romantic move from within the [[avoiding_awkward_silences_and_the_friend_zone | friend zone]] will likely cause the woman to "freak out" and possibly start avoiding the man altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Solutions to the Friend Zone

While the [[avoiding_awkward_silences_and_the_friend_zone | friend zone]] is a common predicament, it does have solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. A dedicated video will soon delve into how to get out of the [[avoiding_awkward_silences_and_the_friend_zone | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

## Common Dating Mistakes that Lead to the Friend Zone

### 1. Playing in Her Field

In dating, a woman's "currency" is sex, while a man's "currency" is commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. The man chooses the direction of any interaction â€“ whether the goal is sex or a long-term relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

If the goal is sex, the woman becomes the "prize." However, if the goal is commitment or a long-term relationship, the man becomes the "prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. It is always easier for a man to play in the "commitment field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

*   **Be Sexual, Not Horny**:
    *   **Sexual**: Being comfortable and unashamed discussing sexual topics, seeing it as normal and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   **Horny**: Being sexually needy, aggressively seeking sex, having an agenda, and being dependent on a specific outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Never appear desperate for sex, as this automatically places you in the "sex field" and makes the woman the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A woman will not continue a conversation if she feels she is the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### 2. Giving Attention Too Easily

To internalize that you are the prize, do not give a woman your attention and approval too easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This is a common mistake where men give excessive attention merely because a woman is attractive, leading her to take them for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

*   **Examples of excessive attention**:
    *   Immediately telling her she's beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   Agreeing with everything she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
    *   Complimenting her excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   Giving her more attention than other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

You are the prize, so be selective with your attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Just as a man is not entitled to a woman's body, a woman is not automatically entitled to a man's attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Only invest time and energy in a girl who is reciprocating that investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### 3. Giving Excessive Compliments

Compliments are often ineffective and can make a man seem like he is "just another guy looking for sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Attractive women live in a state of abundance regarding male options; they are frequently approached and receive compliments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Telling her she's beautiful is not new information and can lead her to categorize you as just another man trying to get with her for superficial reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### 4. Relying on Logic Instead of Emotion

When interacting with a woman in dating or a relationship context, understand that she does not think with her rational mind but reacts based on her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The words themselves matter less than the *feelings* those words evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

*   **Example**: If a woman calls you "skinny" and you logically respond by saying you're working out, her attraction will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Avoid justifying your actions or trying to impress her with rational arguments, as attraction is an emotional and instinctual response, not a conscious choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Subcommunication and Attraction

What a man communicates indirectly (subcommunication) often matters more than his direct words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

*   **Bragging about achievements**: While seemingly demonstrating high value, it often subconsciously communicates insecurity and a need to prove worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **"Nice Guys" vs. "Bad Boys"**: "Nice guys" who spoil women with gifts and expensive dates often get ignored because their actions subcommunicate a need to buy attraction or prove worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Conversely, "bad boys" who act dominant or unpredictable subconsciously send messages of confidence, high status, emotional independence, and that they don't need to prove anything, making them appear as high-value men and attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

You don't need to be a "bad boy" to attract women; you can be respectful and kind while still being highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Understanding female nature and the instinctual rules that govern their emotions is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. If you are single or have not had a fulfilling relationship, it's not a personal flaw but simply a matter of changing your behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

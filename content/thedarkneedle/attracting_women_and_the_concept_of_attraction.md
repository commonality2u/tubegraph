This article explores the concept of [[understanding_attraction_as_a_skill | attraction]] and provides insights into how to effectively communicate with women, drawing from a "secret" approach to [[psychology_of_attracting_women | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The aim is to help men understand how to talk to women, get inside their minds, and make them eager for future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Fundamental Mindset for Attracting Women

The first step in [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | attracting women]] is to change your internal mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. When speaking with a woman, avoid overthinking the conversation topic or how you're going to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

### Don't Place Her on a Pedestal
A crucial aspect of the [[fundamental_mindset_for_attracting_women | fundamental mindset for attracting women]] is to recognize that a woman is "just a human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Do not place her on a pedestal simply because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. Internalizing this fact is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

### See Yourself in a Higher Position
You need to perceive yourself as being in a higher position, with her in a lower one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This perspective will be explained further in the context of interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>.

## Understanding Attraction for Women

Attraction is the single most important and fundamental concept for success with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Without grasping how it works, success in dating will be elusive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

Unlike men, women often act based on how they feel, making decisions driven by emotions rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. Their actions are emotion-based, meaning they essentially cannot control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | Attraction]] is a subconscious response women have towards certain behaviors exhibited by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. To trigger attraction, these behaviors must be incorporated into your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

Key facts about female attraction:
*   Women do not control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.
*   Women do not control who they are not attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   Attraction occurs on an unconscious level and is uncontrollable by conscious thought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### The Subconscious "Radar"

Imagine a woman's subconscious mind as a "radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. When you start talking to her, this radar activates and begins scanning you to determine if you are suitable for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This radar operates independently of her conscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. If the radar "wants" you, her conscious mind will not be able to refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This explains why some women are drawn to "bad guys" despite their logical brain knowing better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

A woman's primary biological goal, from birth, is to find the "right man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. This man is not chosen consciously, but rather sought out and selected by her internal radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. When you speak to a woman, this radar is scanning you to determine if you appear to be better than her, or if she is better than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. The radar assesses this by observing how you interact with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. If you treat her in a way that shows you see yourself as better, the radar will understand this, and she will become attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

## Demonstrating Higher Value Through Body Language

Many [[common_misconceptions_about_attracting_women | common misconceptions about attracting women]] exist regarding body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. The most effective approach is to forget traditional advice and focus on three key points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>:

1.  **Avoid Leaning Towards Her:** Leaning towards a girl subconsciously signals excessive interest, which can be a turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Instead, make it a habit to lean away while talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
2.  **Be Willing to Walk Away:** If a girl says something you disapprove of, almost start walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. Attractive women are not used to men walking away, as they are accustomed to being chased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. This demonstrates high value and increases attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Sit Comfortably and Be at Ease:** The person with higher value in a conversation is the one who sits comfortably and doesn't care about the other person's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Adopt this mindset: sit comfortably, do what makes you feel at ease, and disregard how she perceives you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This means not overthinking hand placement, leg position, or posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Being comfortable and not caring about impressing others is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. When you act this way, the woman will sense that you see yourself as better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

## Conversation Strategy: The 50/30/20 Rule

When communicating, follow this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>:
*   **50% of the conversation:** About her and her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>.
*   **30% of the conversation:** About the environment or anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.
*   **20% of the conversation:** About you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.

The reason for this distribution is that the person who talks excessively about themselves is often the one seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### Talking About Her (50%)
The conversation should center on her: her likes and dislikes, childhood, life plans, dreams, hobbies, and how she perceives her own positive and negative traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This utilizes a "listen like a therapist" approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.

### Talking About the Environment/Anything Else (30%)
In this phase, speak freely without overthinking what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Talk about anything and everything, even if it seems silly, like talking to a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. The goal is to avoid appearing as if you're trying to convey a specific, serious idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. If an argument arises, avoid getting angry or debating to prove a point; remember you don't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### Talking About Yourself (20%)
When talking about yourself, never try to appear amazing or boast about achievements and adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Instead, always make fun of yourself a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. Tell stories that make you look silly or crazy, not great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. This demonstrates that you don't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Be Mysterious (Authentic Approach)
Your personality should have an element of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. This doesn't mean faking your personality, but rather not revealing too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29:00">[09:29:00]</a>. Giving detailed answers to every question can signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.

Examples of a mysterious approach:
*   **Her:** "Where do you work?"
*   **You:** "Hold on there, speedy kitten. We've just met, and you're already interviewing me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>
*   **Her:** "What are you doing Saturday night?"
*   **You:** "Something exciting but secret, sorry, can't tell you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>
*   **Her:** "Have you ever been in a relationship?"
*   **You:** "I don't know you that well yet. I don't discuss private stuff with strangers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>
*   **Her:** "So what's your name?"
*   **You:** "Take a guess. I'll give you a candy if you get it right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>

Not revealing too much too early ensures there's always more she'll want to know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

## Handling Her "Tests"
The woman's subconscious radar will often prompt her to perform "tests" to determine if you are genuinely the "right guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. These tests can cause men to panic and lose focus, potentially making her doubt your authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. The approach to dealing with these tests will be discussed in future content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

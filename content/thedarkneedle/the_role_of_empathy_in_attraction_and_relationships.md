Empathy is considered a key part of a woman's nature and can be one of her biggest "weaknesses" in the context of [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction|attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. When a woman feels empathy for a man, it can become difficult for her to say no, and she may feel a strong [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships|attraction]] towards him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Strategies for Using Empathy

### Sharing Weaknesses
A powerful technique involves sharing your weaknesses with a woman before she discovers them on her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For example, if you don't know how to dance, admitting this beforehand demonstrates [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction|confidence]] because it shows you don't care about her judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This admission can also make her feel empathy for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

### Avoiding the Pity Strategy
While empathy is powerful, it is not recommended to use a "pity strategy" to win over a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. This approach is unlikely to work consistently and could lead to losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Instead, it's advised to use empathy while simultaneously maintaining your strength and masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Asking for Care
If you are already in a relationship and fall ill or need assistance, asking your partner to take care of you can leverage her natural inclination to nurture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Women naturally love to care for others, so asking her to look after you or get medicine for you can strengthen your connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Showing Spontaneity and Losing Control
In appropriate situations, showing a slight loss of control, like a child wanting a hug or gentle touch, can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Being spontaneous and letting go of a constantly strong, composed demeanor, especially when she does something cute or wears something appealing, can make her like you more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. This demonstrates spontaneity and a lack of fear in showing admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This approach is also one of the best ways to avoid the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

#### Important Considerations:
*   This technique should not be used all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   Avoid using it on a first date or when first talking to a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   Start gradually, waiting until at least the second meeting before incorporating such behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

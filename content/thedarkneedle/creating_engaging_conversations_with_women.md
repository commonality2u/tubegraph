To foster extraordinary power in [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversations with women]], a specific formula can be used to create what is known as the "magic phrase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This approach aims to allow you to talk to any woman, anytime, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While it may seem like just an icebreaker, the techniques can be applied in various situations, whether approaching someone new or interacting with colleagues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Pitfall of the Introduction Phase

The initial introduction phase of a conversation is often the most challenging, where men frequently lose attractiveness before the conversation truly begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. A common mistake is immediately bombarding women with boring "get to know you" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### Why Questions Fail

Asking too many questions not only bores the woman but also prevents her from actively engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This creates a dynamic where the man gives the woman all the power in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. For example, a question-and-answer exchange like "Hi, what's your name? Jessica. What is your job? XYZ. Oh, great job, which city are you from?" is perceived as dull by both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

When a man constantly seeks topics to make the conversation enjoyable, and the woman is passively waiting for him to entertain her, the woman quickly becomes bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. The goal is to make the woman *want* to talk, listen, and participate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## The Golden Rule: Use Statements Instead of Questions

A fundamental principle for [[how_to_structure_conversations_with_women | structuring conversations with women]] and gaining conversational power is to "use statements instead of questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This approach directly influences her mind and makes her want to talk to you, shifting the conversational power into your hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Avoiding "Interview Mode"

Using statements prevents the conversation from becoming an "interview mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Instead of merely requesting information, statements allow you to add something to the conversation and encourage the other person to open up more naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Think about conversations with friends or family: they are usually filled with statements, stories, and jokes, rather than a barrage of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Speaking in statements can create the same feelings of familiarity and comfort with someone you've just met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Creating the "Magic Phrase"

The rule for creating the magic phrase is simple: anytime you think of asking a question, turn it into a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

The "magic phrase" is constructed by:
1.  Turning a question into a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:03">[08:05:03]</a>.
2.  Ensuring the statement is about *her* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:07">[08:07:07]</a>.
3.  Including a reasonable assumption (a "cold read") about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:02">[08:08:02]</a>.

#### Example of the Magic Phrase

Instead of asking, "Where are you from?" try saying, "You don't seem like you're from here. Are you European?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

Here's why this works:
*   **Focus on Her**: The subject of the sentence is the woman, and people, especially women, love to talk about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This immediately raises her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Opens a Topic**: Unlike a simple question that just requests information, a statement opens a topic that matters to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   **Sparks Curiosity**: Whether your assumption is correct or incorrect, she becomes curious about how you knew or why you made that assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This engagement increases her interest significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

#### More Examples of Cold Reads:
*   Instead of "What do you do?", say "You seem like a creative person, I bet you work in design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Instead of "Where did you grow up?", say "You don't seem like you grew up around here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

Women are interested in hearing opinions about themselves and what you observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This approach leads to more engaging, interesting, and fun [[engaging_discussions_beyond_mundane_questions | engaging discussions beyond mundane questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. When you make observations and cold reads, she will want to talk to you and understand your reasoning, transforming the conversation dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

## Elevating Interest: Emotions

While statements increase interest, a crucial element for a successful conversation is the presence of emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. [[Effective communication and decisionmaking with women | Emotional connection]] is not built on words or commonalities, but on the *feelings* behind what you're talking about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

To deepen the conversation:
*   **Go Beyond Facts**: Instead of basic questions about her university or job, explore how she *felt* about these experiences and how they influenced her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Explore Relationships**: Ask about the *feelings* associated with her relationships, like with siblings, and how they shaped her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Dive into Motivations**: If she's in a demanding profession like a doctor, ask what motivates her sacrifices or how it *feels* to save a life, rather than just stating observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Share First**: To encourage women to open up, share something deep and personal about yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Demonstrate leadership by sharing your dreams and aspirations, and she will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.
*   **Connect Feelings**: Look for the emotions underneath facts and connect those feelings with your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Evoke Emotion**: Topics like childhood memories, travel, and music are excellent because they tend to put women in an emotional state, making connection easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

By combining the "magic phrase" (statements with assumptions about her) and adding emotions to the conversation, you can significantly heighten her interest and engage her effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

In today's modern world, societal factors such as equality, feminism, and social media have significantly reshaped society, leading men to lose their "original nature" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. This shift has caused men to abandon embracing [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | masculinity]] in favor of logical thinking, believing they need to be nice and find common ground with women to attract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

Despite these changes, women's natural essence has remained consistent; they are emotional beings who do not primarily control their actions through logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. The speaker argues that only men have changed, and the solution for men seeking to attract women is to return to their natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

## Modern Shifts in Male Behavior

Several areas highlight how modern societal changes have impacted male behavior, often causing men to adopt [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | feminine traits]] that are detrimental to attraction:

### Indecisiveness
Indecisiveness is identified as a [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | feminine trait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Men often struggle with leading women because trust is lost early on due to indecisiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Unlike women who might spend an hour deciding what to wear, men should be decisive, knowing what they want and ordering promptly at a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. Sticking to decisions, even if a woman suggests changing them, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

### Romanticism
Romanticism is a purely [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | feminine trait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. Many young men fall into the trap of believing that being romantic will make a girl like them more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. However, the speaker states that a woman loses [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | attraction]] when a man becomes romantic; instead, the woman should be the romantic one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. While occasional romantic actions are fine, a man should never be the primary source of romance in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. A man should internally believe he is not a romantic person, as it is not a [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | masculine trait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### Jealousy
Jealousy is presented as a [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | feminine trait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. While men are attracted to jealous women, jealousy is "completely forbidden" for a man to show <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Men should never monitor a woman's actions or ask about people she talks to, and must act as if it doesn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Women may sometimes unconsciously try to evoke jealousy, and men should show no reaction, as this increases [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. If cheating is discovered, the response should be to end the relationship immediately, not to act possessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

### Emotional Reactivity vs. Rationality
A key difference is that a woman is a "reaction," while a man is the "action" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. In a relationship, the woman should react to the man's actions (e.g., getting angry, sad, or happy because of him) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. If a man reacts to her actions, it means she is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. Men should remain calm and unaffected, "like a rock in the middle of a storm," even when faced with frustrating situations, unless their respect is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

A man is a rational being, while a woman is emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Women can be moody, changing their minds based on fleeting emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>. Men, however, should not be moody; their decisions should be based on logic and what "needs to be done," not just what they feel like doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This [[traits_perceived_as_masculine_versus_feminine | masculine trait]] of rationality is why women are attracted to men who make logical choices, such as eating healthy food even if it's not the tastiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Even if a man struggles with self-improvement, he should present himself as rational to a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Excessive Concern with Appearance
Historically, caring about physical appearance has been associated with women, not men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. However, modern men have become "overly focused on their looks," competing to wear stylish, flashy clothes and excessive accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>. A man's appearance should focus on three simple things: regular exercise, simple clothes with basic accessories, and good personal hygiene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Spending more than five minutes a day looking in the mirror can lead to women losing respect and not seeing a man as a "real man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Men who are overly appearance-focused often fail with women, and even if a man enjoys taking care of his looks, he should not show it to a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

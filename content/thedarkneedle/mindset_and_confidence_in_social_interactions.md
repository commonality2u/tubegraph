True [[honesty_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | honesty and confidence in social interactions]] stem from a mindset that embraces authenticity and eliminates the need for pretense or excessive overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. By dropping "shields" and allowing natural thoughts to flow, individuals can foster genuine connections and avoid the pitfalls of seeking validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Embracing Authenticity

A fundamental aspect of [[mindset_and_selfesteem_in_relationships | mindset and self-esteem in relationships]] is the practice of being genuine and direct. When interacting with others, particularly in romantic contexts, it is crucial to speak what is on one's mind without attempting to appear "cool" or force a specific outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Any other approach is considered a "crutch" or a "shield" to hide behind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

An example of this authentic approach is a direct and honest introduction. Instead of relying on pre-prepared lines, one can simply state their genuine interest, such as "Hey, you're cute. I wanted to get to know you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This approach openly communicates attraction without shame or pretense, removing any barriers to achieving one's intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Shameless Interest

A key technique for showing interest is "Shameless Interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This involves being upfront about attraction and intentions, for example, by directly asking "Are you single?" to clarify one's purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This directness eliminates ambiguity and creates a clear, black-and-white understanding of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

While showing interest is important, it is crucial not to appear "entirely sold" on the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. There's a difference between showing attraction and expressing complete desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. For instance, saying "I like your hair" demonstrates interest without being a generic compliment like "Your hair is beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Compliments can lead to the "friend zone" or make one appear weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. A lover expresses interest, while a friend offers compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It is also acceptable to mention something one doesn't like, maintaining a balanced perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## The Power of Laughter and Spontaneity

The way a person laughs can significantly impact their social interactions. Research suggests that a powerful, loud laugh, reminiscent of ancient tribal leaders, conveys strength and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Conversely, quiet laughter can be a sign of a weaker disposition or a desire to avoid drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While modern society often views loud laughter as impolite, actively cultivating a more powerful laugh can positively transform one's [[importance_of_social_skills_for_success | social life and interactions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Laughter is recognized as a key element in human connection and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

> "If you can change your laugh and make it a powerful one like a Viking leader, you won't believe how much your social life and interactions with women will change." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

Maintaining excessive seriousness can be detrimental to social connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. People are generally drawn to individuals who are spontaneous, natural, and don't take life too seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Overthinking or worrying about what to say hinders genuine interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. When one acts naturally and avoids trying to appear "cool," they are more likely to capture attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

## Non-Verbal Communication and Assumed Attraction

In social interactions, especially when attracting others, the actual words spoken hold less value than the feeling they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. [[importance_of_presence_in_social_skills | Attraction for a woman is linked to the feeling that your words generate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. [[Body language and comfort in social situations | Attraction is 80 to 90% non-verbal]], relying heavily on "subcommunication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This includes:
*   Tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   Body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
*   Breathing patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

Subcommunication bypasses conscious thought and speaks directly to the subconscious, where emotional and sexual desire originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### The "Men with Options" Mindset

A key aspect of [[confidence_and_decisionmaking_in_relationships | confidence and decision-making in relationships]] is the mindset of "men with options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. These individuals assume attraction when they meet new women, because they are accustomed to many women being interested in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This assumption allows them to remain unfazed if attraction isn't immediately reciprocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

In contrast, men who lack options often assume women are not attracted to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. When they encounter a hint of interest, they tend to cling to it, feeling they won't find anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This often stems from an underlying belief that they don't deserve the women they desire, leading them to try "extra hard" to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. However, trying too hard subtly communicates a lack of options, which is generally unattractive to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### Cultivating Assumed Attraction

To adopt the "men with options" mindset, individuals should assume attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. This involves looking the person in the eyes, introducing oneself, and stating the reason for approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. If feeling good and having something genuinely attractive to say, it can be expressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. However, if feeling nervous or uncertain, it's better to avoid overthinking and simply introduce oneself and state the purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The objective is to determine if the other person is interesting and worth one's time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Ultimately, the words spoken during a first interaction are less important than **how one shows up** and **how they make the other person feel** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. Personal regret from missed opportunities can serve as a powerful lesson in taking action and embracing the authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

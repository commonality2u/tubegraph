Attracting women is simpler than commonly believed, requiring a return to basic principles rather than superficial tips like having a strong body, money, or learning seduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many men who successfully enter healthy relationships and attract women don't possess these superficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The secret lies in a particular formula and its application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## The Foundation: Mindset and Self-Perception

Success with women is primarily a [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | state of mind]], as what is in your mind will reflect in your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. A significant reason many men struggle to attract women is that they don't feel they deserve the company of an attractive woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The crucial statement to remember is "she feels what you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Women judge men based on the feelings circulating inside them, not their looks, words, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. These feelings manifest in your [[building_character_and_living_by_a_code_of_ethics | personality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For example, nervousness often leads to rejection because the woman senses a lack of [[developing_a_confident_mindset | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Conversely, a [[developing_a_confident_mindset | confident]], calm, and relaxed approach elicits a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, you must demonstrate that you consider yourself a man whom women naturally desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Avoiding Approval-Seeking Behavior

A common pitfall is trying to win a girl over by pandering to her every whim or putting her on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This behavior often stems from an inner sense of inadequacy and a hidden deficiency, prompting men to go to extreme lengths to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The best way to impress a woman is by *not* trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When you stop seeking her approval, she becomes genuinely impressed because she's accustomed to men trying to woo her, and a different approach captures her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The quest for validation is deeply rooted in [[the_importance_of_mindset_and_selfperception | self-perception]] and [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Men who constantly seek approval often struggle with low [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | self-esteem]], sacrificing their power for acceptance or validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This signals an underlying fear of rejection, leading them to engage in actions to avert it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. An approval-seeking mindset communicates desperation and an lack of confidence, which is a major attraction deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Indifference to Outcome

Men who effortlessly attract women do not tie themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Rejection is an insignificant component of the dating landscape for them; their primary concern is to enjoy the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. When you are indifferent to the outcome, you don't fret about her response, allowing you to focus on making the most out of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Not Placing Women on a Pedestal

It is a common tendency for men to lose control at the sight of an attractive woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Physical attractiveness is often not something a woman worked for, so there's no reason to award her extra points or place her on a "divine pedestal" solely based on looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Behaving unusually or jittery around an attractive woman will likely ruin the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

By avoiding extra niceties solely based on her looks, an intriguing phenomenon occurs: she starts to seek your validation because you didn't readily offer it like others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This categorizes you as a different and unique guy, sparking her genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Maintaining Standards and Principles

A man who understands attraction never settles; he chooses the women he dates rather than accepting whoever comes along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. He has [[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships | high standards]] and adheres to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

A [[building_character_and_living_by_a_code_of_ethics | man of value]] places his [[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships | principles]] above all else, even the woman he is with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He is not afraid to step back if his [[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships | principles]] are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Unlike the average guy who might apologize or compromise his beliefs to prevent a woman from leaving, a [[building_character_and_living_by_a_code_of_ethics | high value man]] will not compromise his [[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships | principles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He is confident in his [[instinctive_human_desire_for_value_and_appreciation | worth]] and is not afraid to stand alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Making Her Strive for Attention

People tend to [[instinctive_human_desire_for_value_and_appreciation | value]] things they strive hard to obtain more than things given effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The same applies to relationships: women tend to [[instinctive_human_desire_for_value_and_appreciation | value]] men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. When you don't react like the average man, she starts to believe there must be something special about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. It's crucial to learn how to make a woman strive for your attention and not be an "open book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

A strategy involves showing interest and then quickly showing disinterest, or offering a compliment with a subtle challenge. For instance, a [[building_character_and_living_by_a_code_of_ethics | high value man]] might say, "You're pretty sure, but I'm not convinced we get along. You seem like too much of a goody two shoes for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This provokes a strong emotional reaction and curiosity, making her wonder why you're different and prompting her to find out more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. When a woman has to work for your attention, she becomes incredibly curious because you're not afraid to challenge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Authenticity and Not Changing Yourself

A common mistake is modifying your behavior or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, often stemming from a fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Adapting to her preferences is akin to being a dead fish in a stream, lacking control over your direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Reshaping your life to suit hers sends a message that you view her as higher [[instinctive_human_desire_for_value_and_appreciation | value]] and that you need to change to match that [[instinctive_human_desire_for_value_and_appreciation | value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

You should not alter who you are just to make a woman feel at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. If she doesn't appreciate aspects of you, she doesn't deserve you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. If she can't accept you as you are, she's the one who needs to change and adapt to your reality if she wants to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. A [[building_character_and_living_by_a_code_of_ethics | high value man]] is not overly concerned with other people's opinions or judgments; he shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

## Abundance Mentality

A [[building_character_and_living_by_a_code_of_ethics | high value man]] understands that there is no shortage of [[strategies_for_being_attractive_without_compromising_masculinity | attractive]] women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. He doesn't fixate on one woman or put all his hopes in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. If one woman rejects him, he knows there are plenty of other opportunities, seeing abundance, not scarcity, when it comes to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

This approach to dating is a [[mindset_shifts_for_dating_success | mindset shift]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Remember to put these [[mindset_shifts_for_dating_success | strategies into action]], as theory without practice is futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

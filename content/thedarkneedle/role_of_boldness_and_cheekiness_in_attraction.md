Impudence is defined as a lack of modesty or boldness, often with a slight disregard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While it might seem negative, in the context of attraction, it is presented as a trait that women instinctively find appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. An impudent man is perceived as capable of survival, a primary trait women look for in a man from an instinctive, not logical, perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This perception stems from an evolutionary understanding that a self-interested and "harsh" individual is more likely to survive challenging situations compared to a "kind and peaceful" one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This underlying principle still applies even in modern circumstances where survival is not an immediate concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

The presence of impudence and [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | boldness]] can lead a woman to become deeply attached and even obsessively so, in ways she may not understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This trait is primarily conveyed through speech, especially at the beginning of an interaction, and should be applied with moderation and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Impudence in conversation comprises four key elements:

## Be Cheeky

Cheekiness, the first element of impudence, involves having a mischievous manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. It aims to make someone wonder, "Did he really just say that or do that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This approach breaks the mold and disrupts the "boredom trance" that often characterizes formal or predictable interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. When you deviate from typical formal interactions, you interrupt her pattern and capture her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Being cheeky means acting with too much familiarity too early, as if you don't know your place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. In contrast, many men become overly cautious and formal, which can lead to a lack of physical or emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Neutrality in disagreement is seen as weakness, and taking an extreme stance is often more influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

One effective method for being cheeky is offering unsolicited advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. For example, telling a blonde-haired girl, "You'd look really beautiful with black hair," demonstrates excessive familiarity and grabs her attention by surprising her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This unexpected comment creates an emotional response, as women rarely experience surprises in conversations with new acquaintances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

## Be Bold

[[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | Boldness]] is considered the most attractive trait to all humans, not just in romantic contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. It involves taking risks, whether real or involving potential embarrassment, and focusing entirely on the present action without dwelling on future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

In interactions with women, boldness means taking the first step, whether it's initiating conversation, flirting, or making physical moves like holding a hand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Bold actions, even simple ones, have a significant impact on others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. People are drawn to bold individuals because they are unpredictable, and repetition is often perceived as boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

Examples of demonstrating boldness:
*   If a girl is talking excessively or raising her voice, a bold response could be, "Shut your trap," a phrase typically reserved for close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shock factor pulls her out of her normal reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Directly addressing a girl who is staring at you with, "I just totally caught you staring at me," is a playful yet bold statement that surprises her and highlights your assertiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The sooner you introduce boldness into a conversation, the more you can establish an emotionally charged and [[psychological_strategies_to_enhance_attraction | attractive]] tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Be Shameless

[[shamelessness_as_an_attractive_trait | Shamelessness]], when attractive, involves having the courage to say things as they are and voicing what you're thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It's about saying what is generally not supposed to be said, similar to how a child might blurt out an observation everyone else is thinking but is too shy to articulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. However, it's crucial that this is done without being hurtful or rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Examples of attractive shamelessness:
*   Reflecting on a past comment she made and stating how you truly felt about it, such as, "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive," without holding back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   Asking a personal, edgy question that everyone might be thinking but no one dares to ask, such as, "Does [girls night] mean you don't shave your legs?" which can then lead to deeper, more intimate conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   Pointing out an obvious observation, like noting a person's height difference and laughing about it, demonstrates that you are unashamed to state what comes to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   "Connecting the dots" by filling in what she might have left out of a story, such as suggesting the reason a dating app relationship failed was "the sex got boring or no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

A key piece of advice is to always "point out the elephant in the room," especially in group settings, by saying what everyone is thinking but is too reserved to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

## Be Slightly Disrespectful

To master impudence, you should be slightly disrespectful, not by insulting or treating her poorly, but by giving her the same level of respect you would give your best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Unlike how people treat formal acquaintances or authority figures, close friends are often spoken to more casually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Most men make the mistake of treating women with excessive respect, walking on eggshells, which hinders any emotional reaction or connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Over-respect can make a woman believe she is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

One way to be slightly disrespectful is by not responding directly to her questions immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Instead of treating her questions as sacred, you can ignore them initially and redirect the conversation, only to return to the question later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This shows she isn't controlling the conversation and makes the interaction more interesting and non-linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. This creates a space for surprise and [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | unpredictability]], triggering attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. It also makes her feel that she needs to "win you over," rather than you submitting just because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

By applying these elements of impudence—cheekiness, boldness, shamelessness, and slight disrespect—you project the image of a strong man who doesn't fear or give excessive attention, leading women to chase you and value your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

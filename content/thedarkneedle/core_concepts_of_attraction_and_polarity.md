This article explores fundamental principles of attraction, emphasizing the concept of polarity and how understanding it can significantly impact one's romantic life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It delves into the idea that [[basic_principles_of_attraction | attraction]] (or [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | sexual electricity]]) is built on a crucial principle: [[the_role_of_opposites_in_romantic_attraction | Opposites Attract]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## The Principle of Opposites Attract

The concept of "sexual electricity" is likened to a battery with positive and negative sides, where polarity generates an electric charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Without this polarity (e.g., two negatives or two positives), no electricity is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

A common misunderstanding of "[[the_role_of_opposites_in_romantic_attraction | Opposites Attract]]" is that it refers merely to superficial physical traits, such as a man being attracted to a feminine woman due to physical differences, or a woman being attracted to a taller man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. In reality, this principle is foundational to all attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Friendship vs. Attraction

A key distinction is drawn between friendship and attraction:
*   Friendship occurs when two similar people meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | Attraction happens when two opposite individuals meet]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Historically, this principle was naturally understood, as [[understanding_male_and_female_attraction | men were men and women were women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. However, modern society, influenced by equality, feminism, and social media, has caused men to lose their natural masculine essence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Many men now try to think more logically, believing they need to be nice and find common ground to attract women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Despite these societal changes, [[understanding_male_and_female_attraction | women's natural essence has not changed]]; they remain emotional beings who do not primarily control their actions through logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. For a man, the solution is to return to his natural state and embody the opposite traits of a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This approach is central to the "[How to Attract Women]" series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

## Key Traits for Men to Embody (Opposite to Feminine Traits)

To create attraction, a man must be the complete opposite of a woman's traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

### 1. Decisiveness (Opposite of Indecisiveness)
Indecisiveness is a feminine trait; women can spend a long time deciding simple things like what to wear or order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. When a man shows indecisiveness, a woman loses trust in his ability to lead, which is a major barrier to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

A man must always know what he wants, make quick decisions, and stick to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Even if a woman suggests changing a decision (e.g., a meal choice), a man should maintain his original choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This [[importance_of_decisiveness_and_logic_in_building_attraction | decisiveness]] leads her to follow his lead or ask for his help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### 2. Non-Romantic (Opposite of Romanticism)
Romanticism is a purely feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. While many women claim to want a romantic man, a man becoming overtly romantic leads to a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. A man is naturally attracted to a romantic woman who expresses affection, but he should not be that way himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Romantic gestures can be nice occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, but a man should never be the primary source of romance in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. For example, if a woman sets a romantic mood, enjoy it, but do not initiate such gestures yourself, like setting up candles and flowers or showering her with love words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. A man must believe and project that he is not a romantic person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 3. Non-Jealous (Opposite of Jealousy)
Jealousy is a feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Men are attracted to women who show jealousy, but for a man, jealousy is forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. A man should never:
*   Ask about people she talks to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   Follow or monitor her actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   Show any reaction if she tries to make him jealous by mentioning other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Acting unconcerned increases her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

If a man discovers actual infidelity, he should end the relationship immediately rather than becoming jealous or possessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Even if he feels jealous, he must suppress this emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### 4. Action-Oriented (Opposite of Reaction-Oriented)
A woman is typically a reaction, while a man should be the action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She should react to his actions (e.g., getting angry, sad, or happy because of him), never the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. If her actions cause him to react, she is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

A man should be like a rock in a storm, unaffected by minor inconveniences or harsh words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. He should remain calm in unexpected situations, such as a restaurant being full or sudden rain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The only exception is when his respect is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### 5. Rational/Logical (Opposite of Emotional/Moody)
A woman is an emotional being, often moody and changing her desires frequently (e.g., food cravings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. A man, as a rational being, should not be moody <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. His decisions should be based on logic, not passing emotions, and he should do what needs to be done, not just what he feels like doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

This rationality is why women are attracted to men who care for their health and make logical choices, even if it means eating healthy food that isn't the tastiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Even if a man doesn't always live this way, he should project it when with a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For example, he should not cancel plans due to a change in mood unless there is a valid excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. In a crisis, a man should remain calm and rational, like a man inspecting car damage after an almost-accident, while a woman might panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

### 6. Simple Appearance (Opposite of Excessive Concern with Appearance)
Excessive concern with appearance is a feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Historically, caring about physical appearance has been associated with women, not men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Men who are overly focused on their looks, competing with stylish or flashy outfits, often fail to attract women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

For a man, three main aspects are sufficient for appearance:
*   Regular exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   Wearing simple clothes with minimal accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   Maintaining personal hygiene, including good fragrance and being well-groomed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

A simple skincare routine (under 3 minutes a day) is acceptable, but spending more than 5 minutes daily looking in the mirror will cause women to lose respect and not see him as a "real man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Even if a man enjoys taking care of his looks, he should not display this excessive focus to a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

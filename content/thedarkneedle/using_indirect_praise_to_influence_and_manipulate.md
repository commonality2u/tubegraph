The video outlines [[techniques_to_influence_thoughts_and_actions | psychological secrets]] aimed at making others admire, like, and become obsessed with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. These methods can be used to become central in your environment or to [[psychological_manipulation_in_relationships | manipulate]] people to meet your needs, effectively turning them into "toys in your hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The core skill involved is "triggering weak points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>, with the "thirst for validation" being one of the most common and easiest to [[manipulation_strategies_in_communication | manipulate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

## Identifying Weak Points
Human behavior, while generally stable, exhibits "spikes" â€” moments of significant increase in emotional response or repetition of a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. These spikes occur when a sensitive nerve is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. If these emotional responses or repetitions relate directly to the person, they indicate a "gap in their defenses" or an "internal deficiency" that they subconsciously desire to be filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Recognizing these weak points allows you to pinpoint the void a person suffers from, like a "radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## The Thirst for Validation
People who exhibit a "thirst for validation" often seek to prove their specialness and gain admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. They might frequently talk about achievements, impressive actions, or romantic successes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. These individuals typically like to feel in control of their social circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Why Indirect Praise is Key
To [[encouraging_admiration_and_influence_in_social_circles | influence]] those with a thirst for validation, "praise" is the bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. However, praise must be given "indirectly" and "intelligently" to affect their subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

*   **Ineffective Direct Praise:** Directly complimenting someone (e.g., "Your style is nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>) is useless and can make you seem like you're "sucking up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Its effect quickly dissipates, and the person will forget it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

*   **Effective Indirect Praise:** The goal is to make the person *feel* praised without directly stating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This requires [[psychological_influence_through_language_and_phrasing | careful phrasing]] and context.

    *   **Seeking Advice:** Ask them for advice on a problem (even a made-up one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. When they offer a solution, respond with statements like, "Wow, you're absolutely right! I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This makes them feel intellectually superior and valuable without direct flattery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

    *   **Third-Party Validation:** Introduce a scenario where another person was talking about their accomplishment or impressive quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, if someone runs six miles, instead of saying "Wow, that's a lot," remain silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. When they ask why you're silent, say, "The other day Henry and I were talking about you, and we were debating whether you could run 6 miles without stopping. He told me 6 miles is a really big number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This approach makes them feel validated and appreciated because they know others are discussing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This conversation will resonate with them for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This technique is similar to the [[use_of_barnum_effect_in_social_skills | Barnum effect]] in how it leverages general statements to feel personal.

    *   **Joking about Positive Traits:** Make a joke about something they are proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. If they are tall, you might say, "How's the weather up there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If they got a girl's number, joke about it later, "Dude, how did you even pull that off?" while laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This reinforces their pride indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### The Addictive Effect
When you effectively hit a person's weak points, especially the thirst for validation through indirect praise, it's like giving them a "drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. As the effect wears off, their brain craves more and associates this positive feeling with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. Without consciously realizing it, they will want to talk to you and meet you again, becoming "addicted" to your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

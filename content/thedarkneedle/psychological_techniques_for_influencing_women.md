To convince someone to adopt your perspective or fulfill your desires, a two-step process is suggested: first, understanding their inner mind, and second, consciously choosing words to influence their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept is also applicable when trying to meet, attract, or win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Step 1: Entering Their Inner Mind by Building Connection

The quickest way to access someone's inner mind is by establishing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Creating a connection means intentionally producing a "click" or bond with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is easier to persuade someone with whom you have a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Role of Non-Verbal Communication

The brain constantly and unconsciously processes a vast amount of non-verbal information, such as facial expressions and body language, including how a person sits, walks, and moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The human body can be thought of in three parts—head, body, and feet—all of which send non-verbal messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

Building a connection relies on the principle that your physical actions affect your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. By observing others' body and face movements, you can gauge their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If you then subtly copy their actions, you may begin to experience similar emotions, due to the link between body and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

For example, walking with your head up and smiling can elevate your mood, while walking with your head down, slowing your pace, and dragging your feet can depress it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This demonstrates how posture directly influences mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Matching and Adapting Mood

To understand someone else's mood and [[psychological_secrets_to_influence_people | influence]] them, you should adjust your own mood to match theirs, thereby creating a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

**Steps to Match and Change Mood:**
1.  **Read the person:** Observe their posture and define their mood (e.g., happy, sad, curious) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Mirror their mood:** Use your body to subtly adopt their posture and express their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  **Immerse yourself:** Use inner dialogue to reinforce the mood, and recall past memories where you felt that way, fully experiencing the emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
4.  **Approach and maintain:** Engage with the person while maintaining the adopted mood until you are on the same emotional wavelength and a connection is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. You will "feel" the connection when it happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
5.  **Shift their mood:** Once connected, gradually change your own gestures, posture, and smile to shift your mood to the desired one, and observe the other person's mood change along with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This process allows you to influence another person subconsciously through non-verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

:::attention
There is a significant difference between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Adapt subtly to aspects of others' movements without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Avoid direct imitation, which is copying gestures like a mirror, as this can cause embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Step 2: Speaking to Their Awareness with Words

After establishing a connection, you can enhance your chances of influencing someone, including women, by strategically using words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The impact comes not just from *what* you say, but *how* you say it, having a psychological effect on the subconscious to bypass refusals and increase agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Specific Verbal Techniques

*   **Emphasize the Obvious:** State something as obvious to make others believe it is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    > "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
    > "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
    > "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>

*   **Questions That Aren't Really Questions:** State what you want them to agree with, and add a question tag at the end, ensuring your voice tone decreases, not increases, at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    > "You already know everything about that, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    > "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
    > "Probably it's time for another drink, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
    > "My plane is about to take off. There's no problem if I skipped a line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    :::caution
    This approach is generally useful for everyday life and shouldn't be relied upon for major life decisions like marriage or large financial requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    :::

*   **"Let's..." for Disguised Orders:** Using "Let's" instead of "Should we..." makes a suggestion sound like a disguised order, reducing the likelihood of refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    > "Let's walk a bit more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
    > "Let's have another one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
    > "Let's go to my place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

*   **Get Them to Say Yes:** The more a person says "yes," the more their mind becomes "yes mode," making them more likely to continue agreeing. Save your main request for after they've agreed to several smaller points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

*   **"This or That" (Limited Choices):** Offer two options, both favorable to your goal, avoiding the option of refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    > "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>
    > "Do you want water or wine, red or white sir, or still or sparkling?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>
    :::caution
    Avoid overused lines like "my place or your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
    :::

*   **Anticipate the Future:** Tell people how you expect them to react positively, influencing their actual reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    > "I know you'll be thrilled about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
    > "I know you'll want to repeat the experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    > "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you, I know you'll be impressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

*   **Logical Leaps ("Therefore" / "This Means That"):** Connect a true statement with a desired conclusion using "therefore" or "this means that," creating a perceived logical link that may not genuinely exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
    > "You're watching this video [true], this means that you like it [maybe true]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
    > "We've been together for 3 months, therefore I must be serious about this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
    > "I've been working at this company for 3 years and have proven my loyalty. This means that it's time to take action and discuss my position in the company and my salary" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

*   **"Order and Order":** Present two commands, where the first is the true desired action, immediately followed by a second, easily achievable command. The person tends to hear only the second, but often follows the first without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
    > "It's late and you're tired. Take out the garbage and come to bed early." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
    > "Come over to my place to have a drink, and tell me everything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>

*   **"I Shouldn't Tell You This But...":** This phrase creates a feeling of loyalty and trust, making others feel special and encouraging them to treat you as a confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Emphasize with "But":** The information that follows the word "but" is what receives the most attention and emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    > "He is always late to work, but he's good at what he's doing." (Emphasizes his competence) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
    > "He's good at what he's doing, but he's always late to work." (Emphasizes his lateness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
    > "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly to new environments." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
    > "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>
    > "I really like you, but I feel better without a partner at this time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>

*   **The "Ideal" Question:** Using "ideal" or "ideally" prompts others to reveal their true desires and envision perfect scenarios, rather than focusing on limitations or what they don't want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This creates positive images and provides valuable information for [[psychological_strategies_to_enhance_attraction | influence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    > "What do you ideally want?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
    > "What are you ideally seeing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
    > "What would you ideally like to happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
    > "What would be the ideal result?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
    *In a job interview:* "So, ideally what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" or "Who would be your ideal candidate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a> You can then adapt your impression and answers to match their ideal description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **"Tell It Without Telling It" (Negative Framing):** Express your viewpoint or give orders by stating what you *won't* do or what they *shouldn't* do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    > "I can't tell you to leave him, the decision must be yours." (Implies they should leave him) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
    > "I won't be the one to tell you that you're wrong." (Implies they are wrong) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
    > "I don't even want to think about the stress you're feeling now." (Acknowledges their stress) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    > "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me." (Implies they should pay you back) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

*   **"Yes Means No":** Offer to do something you don't genuinely want to do by stating "I could... if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    > "I could give you a ride home if you want." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    > "I could do it if you want." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>

*   **"It's Not Important But It Is":** Precede unwelcome feedback or advice with phrases that downplay its importance, making it easier for the other person to receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    > "I know that you won't consider my advice, but I'm worried about your unhealthy lifestyle." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
    > "Maybe you won't care, but your deodorant is too weak and doesn't last long. Have you thought about keeping one for backup at the office?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>

*   **"I Don't Know If You Realize...":** A polite way to demand attention or express a complaint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    > "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
    > "I don't know if you realize how long I've been tolerating this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>
    > "I don't know if you realize how long I've been waiting my turn." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

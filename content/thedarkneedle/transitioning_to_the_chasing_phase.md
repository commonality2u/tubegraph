In romantic relationships, a key dynamic involves letting the woman chase the man, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While many women might claim they would never chase anyone, they are naturally drawn to a man they are pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Understanding the "art of chasing" is crucial for fostering deep attraction and a lasting relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Types of Chasing

There are two primary types of chasing when it comes to women: logical chasing and emotional chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### [[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | Logical Chasing]]
[[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | Logical chasing]] occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear benefit she perceives, such as his wealth or high social status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. She might seek a relationship for financial gain, gifts, or a comfortable lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

However, this type of chasing presents two major issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
*   **Rarity**: High status or significant wealth is uncommon, possessed by only a small percentage of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Lack of Meaning**: This type of pursuit does not lead to a strong, meaningful relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A woman attracted to wealth might appear excited, but her interest is in the money, not in the man himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. She will likely remain on the lookout for someone who can fulfill her core emotional needs, which money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. For a relationship based on genuine love and mutual pursuit, [[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | logical chasing]] is not beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### [[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | Emotional Chasing]]
[[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | Emotional chasing]] happens when a woman pursues a man due to genuine feelings and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions are beyond her control; she desires to be with him and is willing to do anything for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This is the type of chasing that fosters true love, mutual enjoyment, and long-lasting relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A woman will only develop deep feelings and genuine love for a man if this emotional chasing occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Two Stages of Romantic Relationships

To create [[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | emotional chasing]], relationships typically involve two main stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>:
1.  **The Hunting Stage**: When the man actively pursues the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
2.  **The Chasing Stage**: When the woman starts pursuing the man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

These stages are foundational for emotional attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The dynamic can be likened to someone initially offering cigarettes for free until the recipient becomes addicted and willing to pay and chase for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Similarly, in relationships, a man initially gives attention, pulls back, and then returns with more attention. Over time, the woman craves this attention, begins seeking it out, and implicitly "pays the price" (subconsciously, this "currency" for women is sex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### [[the_hunting_phase_in_romantic_relationships | The Hunting Phase]]

[[the_hunting_phase_in_romantic_relationships | The hunting phase]] is about the man taking the initiative and being the "chooser" <a class="yt_timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
*   **Initiation**: As a man, you choose the girl you want and initiate conversations, take the first step, and ask her out on dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.
*   **Hunter Statements**: While you take initiative, you must not chase or follow her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This is reflected in how you ask for a date. Instead of asking "follower" questions that put her in charge (e.g., "When are you free?"), use "hunter" statements that convey leadership and direct action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>:
    *   **Follower**: "When are you free to go out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>
    *   **Hunter**: "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever, you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
    *   **Follower**: "Can I get your number?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>
    *   **Hunter**: "Put your number in my phone, let's stay in touch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   You should tell her what you are going to do, not ask what she wants to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Your confidence in [[maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | leading her]] makes her more comfortable following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Handling Rejection/Excuses**: If she declines a date with an excuse, do not suggest another day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Simply respond with "All right, no problem. Let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Post-Date Contact**: After a date, do not send messages immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Take a step back for about a week, then initiate contact again to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This system allows you to take initiative without chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. If she messages you first during this period, it's fine to respond, but you should only initiate contact once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Date Conduct**:
    *   **Punctuality**: Do not wait more than 10 minutes for a late date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Leaving shows her you have boundaries and better things to do, preventing her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. It's generally better to be on time rather than deliberately late, as women are aware of such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
    *   **Emotional Connection**: The goal of the date is to [[creating_excitement_in_interactions | jack up the energy of the interaction]] and create emotional impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. Avoid boring questions (e.g., "What do you do?") and instead ask questions that spark emotions and [[creating_excitement_in_interactions | emotionally resonate]] with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Examples include: "Remember the last time you did something so exciting you couldn't stop thinking about it?" or "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   **Kiss Test**: When the conversation reaches a high emotional level, conduct a "kiss test" to gauge her readiness for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
    *   **Ending the Date**: End the date when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having a great time, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Crucially, leave without promising another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a> to maintain mystery and [[creating_attraction_through_uncertainty | create attraction through uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Identifying the Transition to the Chasing Phase

You will know you've successfully transitioned to the chasing phase when the woman starts consistently messaging you every day, calling you daily, and actively wanting to meet you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This indicates she has developed feelings and is starting to like you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Actions During the Chasing Phase

Once the woman is emotionally attached and in the chasing phase, your approach changes:
*   **Maintain Scarcity**: Do not always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. When she calls, don't always answer. If she asks to meet, sometimes say you are busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:03]</a>. This prevents her from getting bored and her feelings from cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   **Purposeful Distancing**: This distancing is only effective once she is already attached and showing consistent interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. If done too early in the initial stages, she will lose interest because she hasn't developed feelings yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   **It's Not Manipulation**: This approach is not deceitful; it's about understanding human biology and what women desire in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. Women want a challenge, drama, and a strong man who doesn't follow her in everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Her "Chase Test"**: If she distances herself to see if you will chase her, stay calm and do not pursue her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

Always remember: be the hunter, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

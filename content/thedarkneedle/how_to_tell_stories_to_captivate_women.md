Women are easily [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracted]] to men who know certain secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article focuses on key [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversation techniques]] to captivate women, particularly through storytelling.

## The Art of Storytelling
A significant percentage of men (95%) do not know how to tell a story that captivates a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Simply telling stories that portray you as impressive or adventurous to make her see you as smart or strong is a fast way to fail with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

### Why Stories Work
A woman wants to discover things about you on her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. She doesn't necessarily trust everything you say, so she looks for small clues to determine your status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Stories are a natural way to capture attention and, if told correctly, can drop subtle hints about your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. When listening, a woman reads between the lines to make judgments about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### What Not to Do
Avoid telling stories that accidentally categorize you negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. For example, a story about a Monday night hangover and not having a job can lead her to categorize you as unmotivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. You also don't want to come off as bragging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### How to Tell a Captivating Story
Positive details about your life should be hidden within a larger story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The story itself doesn't have to be positive, but she must be able to uncover positive traits about you through it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

When you reach a moment that makes you look impressive, never emphasize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Pass through it as if it's not a big deal, as if you're not trying to prove anything to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Don't tell too many stories; always [[leaving_women_wanting_more_through_mystery_and_intrigue | leave some mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

#### Example: The Hangover Story (Improved)
Instead of:
> *"On a Tuesday afternoon, you were lying in bed with a hangover, and someone kept knocking on your door until you finally answered it only to find some annoying religious preachers trying to convert you to some strange new religion."* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>

Try this version to subtly convey ambition:
> *"Tuesday afternoon, I was sleeping in. It was the first good, comfortable sleep I had in a couple of weeks since I had been grinding hard trying to take my business to the next level. Monday night we landed an amazing contract and my team and I finally decided it was time to celebrate. Now Tuesday morning I'm lying in bed feeling the kind of hangover I haven't had in years and I keep hearing a knock on the door. I really don't want to get out of bed. Well, the knocking stops for like 10 minutes but then starts up again and now they're ringing the bell too. Finally, I throw on some clothes, head downstairs and open the door thinking it's my neighbor or something urgent instead I find two guys in suits standing there with big smiles holding up a pamphlet. One of them says have you accepted the wisdom of our great leader and I'm standing there half asleep, still hung over looking at these guys like bro, I don't even remember what I accepted last night."* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>

This revised story allows her to conclude you are an ambitious man without you stating it outright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Make Her Want More
One of the most important things to learn about women is how to make them want more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attraction]] forms when she is thinking about you, not necessarily when you are with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Principles
*   **Small Taste vs. Full Bucket**: Like food, a small taste leaves you wanting more, while an abundance can lead to disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Apply this to sharing your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Mystery and Intrigue**: Do not reveal everything right away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Tease her a little and [[leaving_women_wanting_more_through_mystery_and_intrigue | leave some mystery and intrigue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. Women love using their imagination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Anticipation**: During the first few meetings, make her feel anticipation and excitement when you part ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Say something like, "Remind me to tell you about [blank] the next time we meet." Fill the blank with something that will pique her curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. She will keep thinking about you until she sees you again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Anticipation can be a wonderful aphrodisiac <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

## Breaking Awkward Silences
Many men do not recognize the value of knowing how to break awkward silences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. While women are capable of talking for hours, they often remain silent during awkward pauses when with a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Why Men Should Break the Silence
1.  **She Wants a Leader**: By nature, a woman wants you to be in control of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. When you break the silence, you send a subconscious message that you are a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
2.  **Problem-Solving**: The part of a woman's brain responsible for [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] looks for a man's ability to solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Awkward silence is seen as a problem, and she subconsciously tests you to see if you can solve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Breaking the silence demonstrates both leadership and problem-solving abilities, which are highly [[psychology_of_attracting_women | attractive]] qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

[!NOTE]
Awkward silences usually happen only during the first few dates because they are a subconscious test from the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### How to Break Awkward Silences
1.  **Use Humor**: The tension, not the silence, is the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Turn it into a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: "Wow, that was really awkward, huh? One of us needs to say something fast," or "Well, that was awkward" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This instantly releases tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
2.  **Change the Location**: If the conversation loses energy, suggest a change of scenery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: "Hey, let's step outside and get some fresh air," or "I want to introduce you to one of my friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. A new setting generates new stimuli and conversation topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
3.  **Have Pre-Prepared Topics**: Use "canned responses" (pre-planned topics) strategically to shift the conversation to a deeper level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Example**: After a pause, say as if thinking deeply, "I was wondering, are you always this nice to strangers since we just met? What were you thinking when I approached you? What was your first impression of me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a> This uses the silence to talk about the situation itself, allowing her to express thoughts and feelings, making the [[creating_engaging_conversations_with_women | conversation more engaging]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

## How to Listen to Women
Your job when a woman is talking is to remove the idea from her mind that you're just there to try to win her over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. A guy trying to win a woman over will rush to speak, try to impress, and constantly interrupt to talk about himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

[!TIP]
When a girl starts speaking, you need to listen, and make her feel that she is the one winning *you* over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Here are steps to listen effectively and make her think about you:
1.  **Get the Whole Message First**: Don't rush to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Sit back, relax, and let her finish her thoughts completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Interrupting makes you seem like you're trying too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
2.  **Amplify**: Reinforce what she said and show you understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If she talks about enjoying the beach, respond with, "Isn't it amazing how just sitting by the ocean can make you feel so calm and free?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> This amplifies her positive emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
3.  **Echoing**: Rephrase her words in your own way, not just repeating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If she talks about a refreshing trip out of town, respond with, "Yeah, sometimes just getting out of the city and leaving everything behind for a while feels so refreshing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This shows true understanding and deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
4.  **Empathy**: Convey "I understand how you felt" without explicitly saying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Mention the emotions she likely felt, rather than just commenting on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If she was stuck at the airport due to a canceled flight, instead of "Wow, what a terrible airline," say "You must have felt so frustrated just sitting there knowing there was nothing you could do about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Another way**: Comment on her passion for something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. If she's enthusiastic about photography, say, "You really have a deep love for photography, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> This shows you notice her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
5.  **Captioning**: Bring up things she mentioned earlier in the conversation, especially with humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If she mentioned a terrifying but thrilling skydiving experience earlier, and later is nervous about a job interview, say, "Come on, you jumped out of a plane, how scary can a job interview be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> This shows you were paying attention and reminds her of a positive self-associated experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. People love it when others remember details about their lives, especially things they are proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

By applying these listening techniques, you become someone who truly understands her, which will make her think about you all night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

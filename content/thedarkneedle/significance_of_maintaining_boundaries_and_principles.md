Maintaining strong boundaries and adhering to one's principles is crucial for attracting women and fostering healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57">[09:57]</a>. This approach communicates self-respect and high value, which women find attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40">[14:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33">[15:33]</a>.

## Prioritizing Principles and Self-Respect

A "high value man" prioritizes his principles over any girl and demonstrates a strong willingness to walk away if these principles are crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57">[09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02">[10:02]</a>.

For instance, in a disagreement where a girlfriend threatens to leave, an average man might immediately apologize and compromise his values to prevent her departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08">[10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16">[10:16]</a>. In contrast, a high-value man would respond with indifference, indicating he won't compromise his principles, and would be willing to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22">[10:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>. This behavior signals that he has other options and does not fear losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32">[10:32]</a>.

## Authenticity and Genuineness

It is essential that what you present aligns with your true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10">[13:10]</a>. If your words and actions do not match your authentic self, you will come across as fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:14">[13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:58">[13:58]</a>. Avoid doing anything that goes against your nature simply to please a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45">[13:45]</a>. Being honest with your personality is a powerful way to make a girl feel safe, as she will sense she is with someone trustworthy and genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50">[13:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54">[13:54]</a>.

## Embracing Disagreement and Challenge

Do not be afraid to engage in debates or disagreements from time to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31">[14:31]</a>. If you consistently play by her rules and agree with everything she says, you inadvertently signal that you don't know how to demand the respect you deserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35">[14:35]</a>. This suggests a fear of negative consequences from disagreements and shows a lack of self-belief, leading to a fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42">[14:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48">[14:48]</a>.

Women seek a challenge, and you will never be perceived as a challenge if you agree with them on everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33">[15:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34">[15:34]</a>. A mix of emotions, including respectful disagreement, contributes to a long-lasting attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37">[15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40">[15:40]</a>.

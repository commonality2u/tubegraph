The core principle in dating is to let the woman chase the man, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While many women might claim they would never chase anyone, a woman is naturally drawn to the man she is pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This article explores the art of chasing, outlining the two main types of chasing and the stages involved in a relationship dynamic where the woman ultimately pursues the man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Types of Chasing

There are two distinct types of chasing when it comes to women: [[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | logical chasing]] and [[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | emotional chasing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Logical Chasing
[[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | Logical chasing]] occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear benefit she perceives, such as his wealth or high status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Her interest stems from the desire for financial gain or a comfortable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

However, this type of chasing has significant drawbacks:
*   **Rarity and Difficulty** It is extremely rare and difficult for most people to achieve the level of wealth or status that would provoke logical chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Meaningful Connection** [[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | Logical chasing]] does not lead to a strong, meaningful relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A woman might stay for financial success but will always seek someone who can fulfill her core emotional needs, which money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This approach is only viable if one intends to be a "sugar daddy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Emotional Chasing
[[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | Emotional chasing]] happens when a woman pursues a man due to her genuine feelings and love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions are beyond her control; she cannot stand being away from him and is willing to do anything for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This type of chasing fosters love, enjoyment in the relationship, and contributes to its longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A woman will never truly love or develop deep feelings without [[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | emotional chasing]] taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Two Main Stages of Relationship Dynamics
In a relationship, there are two primary stages: the [[the_hunting_phase_and_building_attraction | hunting stage]] and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These stages are foundational for creating emotional chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

> [!example] The Cigarette Analogy
> Imagine a friend gives you a cigarette. You try it and like it. This continues for a while until you start craving it and seeking it out yourself. Then, when you ask for it, he requires payment. You become addicted, chasing him and paying for the cigarette <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. In this analogy, the friend giving the cigarette is in the hunting phase, and you becoming addicted and paying is the chasing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
>
> This mirrors romantic relationships: a man initially gives attention, pulls back, then gives more, making the woman crave it and eventually seek it out, unconsciously "paying the price" (e.g., with intimacy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

## The Hunting Phase
The [[the_hunting_phase_and_building_attraction | hunting phase]] is characterized by the man taking initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. As a man, your role in the [[navigating_the_dating_market | dating market]] is to choose the girl you want, necessitating you to take the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Taking Initiative
*   **Initial Contact** When meeting a girl for the first time, you typically initiate conversation, take the first step, and ask her out on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Hunter Statements vs. Follower Questions** Although you take initiative, you should not "chase" in a submissive way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. Avoid "follower questions" that put the ball in her court for decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Instead, use "hunter statements" by telling her what you plan to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>:
    *   *Follower:* "When are you free to go out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
    *   *Hunter:* "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever; you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
    *   *Follower:* "Can I get your number?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>
    *   *Hunter:* "Put your number in my phone, let's stay in touch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   Tell her what you're going to do; she desires a man who knows what to do and acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Confidence in leading makes her feel comfortable following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Handling Rejection** If she declines a date with an excuse, do not suggest another day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Simply respond, "All right, no problem, let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Space** After a successful first meeting, avoid messaging her immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Take a step back for about a week before messaging again to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This weekly initiation pattern ensures you take initiative without chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If she initiates contact during this phase, it's fine to respond, but you should only initiate once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Date Dynamics
*   **Punctuality** Do not wait for a date for more than 10 minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. If she is late, leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This holds her accountable and shows you have better things to do than wait, preventing her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. While some advise showing up late on purpose to make her chase, being on time is generally better as women today are perceptive to such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Conversation** Focus on engaging her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Avoid generic, boring questions like "What do you do for work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Instead, ask emotionally resonant questions, such as:
    *   "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>
    *   "If you were guaranteed not to fail, what would you want to become?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>
    *   "Who is the person you care about the most in your life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
    *   [[techniques_to_avoid_running_out_of_conversation_topics | This approach]] aims to trigger her emotions during the date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Kiss Test** When the conversation reaches a high level of emotional involvement, you can perform a "kiss test" to see if she is ready for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Ending the Date** End the date when the conversation is at its peak and you are both having a great time, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Do not promise another date; leave to maintain mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Continue this process until the girl consistently messages you daily and engages with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This indicates she is developing feelings for you and is ready to transition to the chasing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## The Chasing Phase
Once a woman starts messaging you daily, calling you, and wanting to meet frequently, she has entered the chasing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. At this point, you need to adjust your availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Strategies for the Chasing Phase
*   **Limit Availability** Do not always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. If she calls, don't always answer. If she asks to meet, sometimes say you're busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Availability** Making yourself constantly available once a girl becomes attached can lead to her quickly getting bored and her feelings cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. This strategy ensures the relationship remains long-lasting and enjoyable by making her chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Timing is Key** This distancing should *only* occur once the girl is already attached and initiating contact daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. If you distance yourself too early, before she has developed feelings, she will lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   **Not Manipulation** This approach is not manipulative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Women naturally desire drama and a challenge in a relationship; they want to chase a strong man who challenges them, not one who is too nice and always follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Her Distancing** When a woman starts chasing, she might occasionally distance herself to see if you will pursue her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. If this happens, stay cool and do not chase her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Ultimately, always remember to be the hunter, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

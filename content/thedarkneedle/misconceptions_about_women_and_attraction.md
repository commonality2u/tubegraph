[[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | Attracting women]] is a skill, nothing more and nothing less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Your appearance and financial status play a very small role in creating [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] in a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. As a person, you don't need anything to [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Being single and not succeeding with girls is simply a lack of knowledge about how to [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attract a woman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Busting Common Myths About Attraction
It's crucial not to take your failure with [[understanding_female_attraction | women]] personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Social media is often filled with influencers who claim you need to be tall, go to the gym, have money, or grow a beard to [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, personal experience shows that success with [[understanding_female_attraction | women]] can skyrocket by researching and studying [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | female psychology]], regardless of initial appearance or financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

Observing couples in public reveals that many men with "extremely beautiful women" are not all tall, physically strong, rich, or bearded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. The way a woman is [[understanding_female_attraction | attracted]] to a man has evolved due to factors in place for millions of years, not the modern world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. As a man, all you need to do is understand these factors and how [[understanding_female_attraction | women think]] to [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attract them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. If you are single, it's likely due to certain behaviors that make it impossible for a woman to consider a relationship with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The "Playing Field" Dynamic
When dating, you should always "play in your own field, not in hers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. In the dating market, a woman's currency is sex, while a man's currency is commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.
A conversation or date will always have two possible directions: sex or a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. As the man, you are the one who chooses the direction, which is biologically ingrained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

*   If the goal is sex or a one-night stand, the woman is the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   If the goal is commitment or a long-term relationship, the man is the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

It will always be easier for a man to play in the "commitment field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While sex is natural and women enjoy it, it should not be your primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Being Sexual vs. Horny
1.  **Program your subconscious not to want just sex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This means being sexual but not horny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Sexual:** Comfortable, adult, not ashamed of the topic, normal and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   **Horny:** Sexually needy, aggressive, dependent on a certain outcome, desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    *   Never be horny or desperate for sex around a girl, as this automatically puts you in the sex field, making her the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A woman will not continue a conversation or relationship if she feels she is the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

2.  **Understand and internalize that you are the prize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. If you give a woman your attention and approval too easily, she won't value you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This is a common [[mistakes_men_make_while_interacting_with_women | mistake men make]], giving too much attention just because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This includes telling her she's beautiful right away, agreeing with everything, or complimenting her excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
    *   As the prize, you need to be more selective in giving attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
    *   Women are not automatically entitled to your attention and approval, just as you are not entitled to touch her body <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
    *   Only give your time and energy to a girl who is investing her own time and energy into the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This makes you valuable and worth chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## The Friend Zone
One of the biggest factors behind failure with [[understanding_female_attraction | women]] is the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. The common idea from romantic movies that "you have to be a good friend before you become a good lover" is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In reality, once you fall into the friend zone, a girl will never see you as a potential partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. You will remain just a friend, treated like "one of her girlfriends in mail form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If you try to make a move, she will likely "freak out" and avoid you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The Compliment Trap
One of the biggest [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | mistakes guys make]] is showering women with compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Compliments will not help you and may make you seem like "just another guy looking for sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. An attractive woman lives in a state of "abundance when it comes to male options" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. She is constantly approached by men and used to receiving compliments from all types of men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

Since these [[understanding_womens_attraction_to_men_with_options | women have many options]], they will likely categorize you as just another guy trying to get with them for one reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Telling her she looks beautiful is not new information; she already knows, and the last thing she needs is another man telling her how great she looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Logic vs. Emotion in Attraction
When talking to a woman, understand that you are not speaking to a rational being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. While women are intelligent, when they interact with a man, date, or enter a relationship, you need to forget about logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. In these moments, she reacts based on her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The words you say won't matter as much as what your words make her feel emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

For example, if a woman calls you skinny and you respond logically by saying you're working out, her [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] towards you immediately decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Do not talk to a woman with logic, justify your actions, or try to impress her with rational arguments, because [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] is an emotional and instinctual response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Subcommunication and "Bad Boys"
When a man brags about achievements to impress a woman, she doesn't focus on what he says as much as what he communicates indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. She picks up that he feels insecure and inadequate, resorting to bragging to prove his worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. This is why women are strongly [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | attracted]] to "Bad Boys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

"Nice guys" often wonder why "Bad Boys" treat women badly yet are loved, while they shower women with gifts and get ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It all comes down to **subcommunication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*   When a "nice guy" spoils a woman, he thinks he's showing he's amazing and can take care of her, but the exact opposite happens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   When a "bad boy" acts arrogant, dominant, or unpredictable, he subconsciously sends the message that he is a man of higher value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The woman subconsciously perceives him as confident, holding high status, emotionally independent, not needing to prove anything, and making her feel lucky to have his attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This makes him appear as a high-value man and thus [[understanding_female_attraction | attractive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

You don't have to be a "bad boy" to [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. You can be respectful and kind while being highly [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attractive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. All you need to do is understand this instinct and [[understanding_female_attraction | female nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

## Women Are Not Complicated
Stop believing the nonsense that [[understanding_female_attraction | women are complicated]] or hard to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. [[understanding_female_attraction | Understanding women]] is actually very easy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Women are emotional beings who operate based on a set of instinctual rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Once you understand these rules, you will be able to [[understanding_female_attraction | understand any woman]], regardless of her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

If you're single or have never been in a fulfilling relationship, don't take it personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The problem is never with you or the [[understanding_female_attraction | women]], but simply with your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. All you need to do is change your behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

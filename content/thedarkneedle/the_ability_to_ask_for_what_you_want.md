The ability to ask for what you want is considered one of the most attractive traits to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Demonstrating This Trait

*   **In a restaurant setting** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>: When a waiter approaches, a common mistake young men make is asking others what they should order and basing their choice on that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Instead, you should order confidently what *you* want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This is a habit to consistently adhere to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
*   **In everyday situations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>: If you're in a taxi and feel hot, ask the driver to open the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. These seemingly small actions play a significant role in fostering [[understanding_attraction_as_a_skill | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.
*   **At work** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>: If you feel you're doing a lot of work but aren't paid enough, you should approach your manager and ask for a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

## Handling Rejection or Denial

It is not an issue if your request is denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. For example, if a taxi driver cannot open the window because he's sick, his refusal does not negate the positive impact of you making the request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Avoid Faulty Thinking
> Many people fear asking for what they want due to the thought: "What if I ask and they say no? I'll feel embarrassed in front of the girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This is faulty thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The crucial aspect is that you asked for what you desired, and you should not feel embarrassed if the request is denied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

Moving forward, it is advised to always ask for what you want, regardless of the situation, without hesitation or overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

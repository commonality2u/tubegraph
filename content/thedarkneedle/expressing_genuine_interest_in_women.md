## The Power of Authenticity
When [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching women]], true [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] stems from authenticity, not from acting with fake [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | confidence]] or hiding behind a shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Instead of trying to appear cool or force an outcome, simply saying what is on your mind is the most effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Any other method is considered a "crutch or a shield to hide behind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Being spontaneous and not taking things too seriously is a crucial quality for attracting women and living happily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Overthinking or worrying about what to say hinders this natural flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. Women are drawn to men who are at ease with themselves, enjoy the moment, and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### The Problem with Hiding Intentions
Women continuously assess how they should feel about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. If you are not completely honest and genuine about your [[setting_clear_intents_in_interactions_with_women | intentions]], they will sense it through your face, body language, and subtle reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The goal is to create an interesting and attractive conversation that fosters comfort and openness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Many men struggle with what to say when [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching women]], often asking for specific lines or openers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. However, the root problem is nervousness and the belief that this needs to be hidden from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This leads to overcompensation due to feelings of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Relying on scripted lines prevents comfortable [[effective_communication_with_women | communication]] with women long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

## Shameless Interest
The "authentic approach" involves never trying to hide your [[setting_clear_intents_in_interactions_with_women | intentions]] or pretending you're not [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attracted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In fact, it is beneficial for her to know you are [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attracted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

This concept is called **Shameless Interest**â€”expressing interest without any shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. An example of this is directly asking "Are you single?" as it conveys clear [[setting_clear_intents_in_interactions_with_women | intention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Other examples include:
*   "Stop being so cute, you made me forget what I was going to say." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   "What an incredibly adorable person you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
*   "I can already tell that I'm going to like you. Should we just skip everything and get married already?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
*   "If you're trying to make me like you, it seems to be working." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>

This technique can be used during initial meetings or on a second date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. If the interaction is casual (e.g., classmate, coworker), it is advisable to start with casual conversation and apply this approach on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

The primary reason men get stuck in "gray areas" with women is their fear of [[balancing_interest_and_disinterest_when_pursuing_women | showing direct, genuine interest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Straightforward interest clarifies the situation, making things black or white <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This approach is simple, honest, and authentic, requiring no games or excessive cleverness, but it does require courage, which women find [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attractive]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Shameless Interest vs. Compliments
While showing interest is important, you should not appear to be "entirely sold on her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. When an [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attractive]] woman is approached, she usually assumes interest due to her ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Hiding your [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] can make you appear weak or lead to being put in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The key is to show her that she [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attracts]] you, but not that you desire her completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. For example, saying "I like your hair" is Shameless Interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. However, saying "Your hair is beautiful" is a compliment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Compliments are often heard by women and can lead to being perceived as a friend or seeming weak because you didn't express your interest honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

A lover expresses interest, while a friend offers compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. When speaking to a woman, express what interests you about her, and if there's something you don't like, communicate that too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## The Role of Non-Verbal Communication
The actual words you say when [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching a woman]] hold less value than the feeling they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | Attraction]] is primarily non-verbal, accounting for 80% to 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This "subcommunication" includes your tone of voice, body language, eye contact, and breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Subcommunication directly influences the subconscious, where emotional and sexual desire originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

Men who are successful with women assume that women are [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attracted]] to them because they are accustomed to many women being interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If a woman is not interested, it doesn't bother them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. Conversely, men who lack options often assume women aren't [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attracted]] to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. If they find a woman who shows interest, they cling to her, fearing they won't find anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This stems from a deep-seated belief that they don't deserve the women they desire, leading them to try too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

Trying too hard subtly communicates a lack of options, which is not [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attractive]] to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Women are drawn to men who have options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Assuming [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] means looking her in the eyes, introducing yourself, and stating why you approached her directly, e.g., "Hey, you're [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attractive]], what's your name?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

If you genuinely feel you have something awesome or attractive to say, express it, as this will come across in your subcommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. If you are nervous or uncertain, do not overthink it; simply introduce yourself and state your reason for approaching her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Your mission should be to find out who she is and if she is interesting enough to spend your time talking to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Anything beyond this is "over effort" and will work against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. What is remembered is how you showed up and how you made her feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

## Regret of Missed Opportunity
Not expressing interest can lead to deep regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. The regret of not approaching someone due to overthinking can result in missing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Learning from such mistakes can benefit others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

When interacting with women, especially attractive ones, men will often be tested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>. These "tests" are a way for women to gauge a man's confidence and see if they can throw him off balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.

## Why Women Test Men

Women test men to understand their confidence levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>. If a man remains unfazed and shows he "couldn't care less," he passes the test, which increases her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Conversely, if he becomes defensive, insecure, or tries to justify himself, he fails, causing her attraction to fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## Common Forms of Tests

Tests typically come in the form of snide remarks, tricky questions, or unreasonable requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   "I bet you use that line on all the girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>
*   "How many women have you slept with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>
*   "Buy me a drink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>

## How to Pass These Tests: Agree and Amplify

The easiest method to pass these [[understanding_and_handling_conversational_tests_from_women | conversational tests]] is to "agree and amplify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>. This means agreeing with what she says and taking it to an exaggerated, almost absurd level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### Examples of Agree and Amplify in Action

Here's how to apply the "agree and amplify" technique to common tests:

*   **Test:** "I bet you use that line on all the girls." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>
    *   **Response:** "Yeah, I wake up every morning surrounded by women. Is that good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>
*   **Test:** "How many women have you slept with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>
    *   **Response:** "Today? Not that many." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>
*   **Test:** "Buy me a drink." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>
    *   **Response:** "Sure, would you like my ATM PIN too?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>

Passing these tests by maintaining confidence and using humor like "agree and amplify" can significantly increase a woman's attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

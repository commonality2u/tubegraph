The qualifying technique is a powerful method used to make a girl interested in you by subcommunicating that you have many options and are selective in your choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This approach shifts the dynamic, making her feel like she needs to impress you, rather than you chasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Why Girls Ignore You <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

A girl might ignore you for one of two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
1.  **It's a test**: This usually happens if she was previously interested in you or you've already gone out with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **She sees you as having limited options**: This is the more common reason if she wasn't interested from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. She perceives that you don't have many other options and are chasing her because she's the only one you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

When you give a girl too much attention, making her feel like she's your only focus and you'll do anything to please her, she might perceive you as having low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Mistake of Faking Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>

A common mistake is trying to lie or hint that you have many options when you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. This approach has two negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>:
1.  **She'll discover you're lying**: Lying is a significant attraction killer as it shows you're willing to do anything for her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.
2.  **She'll realize you're seeking her approval**: Even if she believes you have options, trying to convey this means you're still seeking her approval, which is a major turn-off in [[strategies_for_maintaining_confidence_and_selfworth_in_dating | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> Avoid making up stories about imaginary relationships or hinting that you have many options, as this can worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

## What is Qualifying? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

Women are not primarily concerned with how many actual options you have, but rather how you interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If you treat a woman in a way that suggests you have options, she will assume you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

Qualifying means screening or filtering potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. It's an action typically taken by someone who has a lot of choices and needs to narrow them down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you subtly communicate that you have many options because only someone with options would engage in this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This technique helps solidify a girl's attraction, moving beyond casual flirting to making her feel like you're choosing her over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The goal is to make her feel like she's starting to win you over and impress you based on her personality and qualities, not just her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The mantra is: "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

If you don't qualify her, she might perceive that you're just trying to "get into her pants" or that you lack options and would settle for any girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. When you do qualify, she gets the impression that you are choosy because you have options and have selected her for a specific, meaningful reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Ways to Qualify a Girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

Here are three effective ways to qualify a girl and make her feel special and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>:

### 1. The Qualifying Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
Ask a question that encourages her to share positive qualities about herself, then acknowledge those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

**Example 1**:
"You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason I'm drawn to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. I just feel really comfortable talking to you and I don't know why that is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>

This prompts her to think about how to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. When she shares, accept her for it by saying, "Wow, that's really cool, I like that about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This makes her feel special and that you're genuinely interested in who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

**Example 2**:
"You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, and I'm kind of curious about you now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

Always accept what she tells you; otherwise, she'll feel rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. When you accept her for her personality, it sets you apart, especially for attractive women who are often only valued for their looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>
Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've noticed in her, then end with a question that invites her to confirm it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. When she agrees, she'll start acting more consistent with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**Example 1**:
"You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open, and that's so refreshing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

Once she says "yes," she will naturally become more open with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This technique makes her feel like you recognize something valuable and unique about her, fostering a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

**Example 2**:
"You know what I like about you? You're so bold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. Like, you don't filter yourself at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. You just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. It's refreshing; it makes me feel comfortable around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

The key is to make the statement open-ended, positive, and vague enough so she can't definitively say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. When you accept her for being something, she steps into that frame and becomes that person around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

Common qualities to look for and acknowledge include: open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, and easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. For extremely attractive women, a powerful statement is: "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This is effective because people tend to value qualities they are not usually recognized for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>; pretty girls often wish to be seen as smart, and smart girls wish to be told they are pretty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>
Often, girls will try to qualify themselves to you without prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Your role is simply to notice and acknowledge her for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

**Examples of a girl qualifying herself**:
*   Bragging about herself in hopes of your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touching you or showing direct interest, wanting you to like her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asking if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you notice a girl intentionally trying to impress you or get you to like her more, you should acknowledge and appreciate her effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is cool, tell her you like her, or use physical affirmation like putting your arm around her to show she's winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

If you don't acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, when you do acknowledge and accept her, she'll feel great and continue to engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This principle applies beyond dating; acknowledging appreciated qualities in anyone can make them feel seen and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Important Considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

[[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication | Effective communication]] and social skills are fundamental to success in life, reportedly accounting for 85% of overall success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. These skills are common among successful individuals like CEOs, company executives, and world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The core of effective communication lies in understanding and satisfying a deeply ingrained human instinct: the "hunger for value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. When this hunger is properly addressed, individuals will be drawn to you and responsive to your influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## Core Principles

### Satisfying the Hunger for Value
Humans inherently desire to feel valuable in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. By learning to properly "feed this Instinct in others," you can become a highly admired individual within your social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

*   **Example of Positive Influence:** A math tutor recounted an experience with a slow-learning student whom he praised for his hard work, stating that this trait would eventually lead him to surpass his classmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This positive reinforcement, considered a form of [[manipulation_strategies_in_communication | positive manipulation]], motivated the student to study with increased energy, primarily to please the tutor and prove he deserved the praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Making Them Feel Impressed and Influential
To leave a lasting impression and influence someone, the golden rule is to make *them* feel like they are the ones who impressed and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of trying to show how amazing you are, highlight their amazing and remarkable qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

### Focused Conversation
Make the conversation revolve around the other person and focus on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. There are two primary ways to achieve this:

1.  **Let them talk about themselves and build on their narrative:** If someone shares an experience, avoid shifting the focus to your own similar experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Instead, keep the focus on them by asking follow-up questions that delve deeper into their story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Active listening is crucial here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
2.  **Redirect a general topic towards them:** When a conversation begins on a general topic (e.g., the weather), pivot by asking about their personal preferences or experiences related to that topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This gives them value and fulfills their instinct, making them feel influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Allowing Others to Earn Your Admiration
When someone begins to try and earn your admiration, it signifies that you have already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This applies broadly, including in [[effective_communication_with_women | interactions with women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Don't try to prove yourself:** Show that you don't need to prove any idea or point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   **Handling Interruptions:** If someone interrupts you during a conversation, often the best approach is to let them talk or change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Insisting on returning to your previous topic can be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This demonstrates that you are not trying to assert yourself or prove anything, which is a display of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The strongest person in society does not need to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   **Persistent Interruptions:** If someone *constantly* interrupts, it's appropriate to calmly and directly ask them to let you finish what you're saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. As a man, society expects clear and direct expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. If they continue, it's acceptable to disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Recognizing Their Presence as a Person
Value people for who they are, not for their job, wealth, or actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   **Avoid Interrogative Questions:** Refrain from asking intrusive questions about their job, education, or personal habits (e.g., "Do you still smoke?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The person should feel that your interest is in them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Do Not Offer Unsolicited Advice or Lectures:** Avoid lecturing or telling people what they need to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Advice should only be given when explicitly asked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This demonstrates that you accept them as they are, problems and all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Never Place Yourself Above Others:** Do not put yourself in a superior position by giving unsolicited advice or trying to fix their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid Correcting Trivial Facts:** If someone states a minor factual inaccuracy that doesn't impact the conversation's meaning, do not correct them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This is a common bad habit that offers no meaningful gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Giving Opportunity for Admiration
Encourage others to strive for your admiration:

*   **Ask for Opinions and Suggestions:** Most people prefer to talk about themselves and their opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. By asking for their opinion on a topic and genuinely listening, you allow them to express themselves and feel valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Listen to Suggestions:** If someone offers advice or suggestions, listen to them without immediately shutting them down or treating them as if they don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   **Never treat anyone as if they don't understand or as if you're better than them** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Treat everyone as your equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   If a suggestion isn't suitable, politely state you need to think about it rather than outright rejecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### Authenticity vs. Improvement
The advice "be yourself" can be detrimental when applied to self-improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Just as one might change unhealthy habits (like smoking) or improve their physical fitness, social skills are a skill that requires practice and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

Many common beliefs suggest that attracting women requires a strong physique, wealth, or specific seduction techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, most individuals in healthy [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | relationships]] and those who effectively attract women do not possess these superficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | Attracting women]] is described as surprisingly easy, requiring a return to the basic principles of [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The key to success with women is fundamentally a state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, as one's internal state is reflected in their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## "She Feels What You Feel"

A crucial principle to remember is "she feels what you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Women assess men not based on their looks, words, or financial status, but on the feelings they exude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. These feelings shape a man's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.
For example:
*   Nervousness significantly increases the chance of rejection, as the woman perceives a lack of [[Importance of confidence and selfworth in relationships | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Approaching with [[Importance of confidence and selfworth in relationships | confidence]], calmness, and relaxation leads to more positive responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

It is therefore essential to demonstrate that you view yourself as a man women naturally desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Avoiding Approval-Seeking Behavior

Men often struggle with low self-esteem, leading them to seek approval or validation from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This behavior, often stemming from a hidden sense of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, is a major deterrent to [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

Key points to avoid:
*   **Pandering to her whims**: Don't treat a woman as though she's on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Trying excessively to impress or saying things just to please her indicates an inner deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Trying too hard**: The best way to impress a woman is by not trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. When a man makes a "song and dance" to get her attention, she's unlikely to be impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Her interest is piqued when a man *stops* seeking her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Fear of rejection**: Men seeking approval often have an underlying fear of losing the woman, even before interaction begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. This leads them to act in ways that might avert rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, continually seeking validation to confirm they are "on the right path" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Negative impact**: When a woman senses a man craves her approval, she can lose interest almost instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Indifference to Outcome and High Standards

Men who effortlessly attract women do not tie themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Rejection is viewed as insignificant, merely a component of the dating landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their primary concern is to enjoy the experience, regardless of the woman's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. When indifferent to the outcome, a man focuses on making the most of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

A high-value man maintains his standards and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. He:
*   **Doesn't lose control**: Avoids behaving unusually or jittery around attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Physical attractiveness, which women don't necessarily work for, should not automatically award them "extra points" or place them on a "divine pedestal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Doesn't settle**: Unlike many men who settle for available options when their ideal woman seems unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, a man who truly understands [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] always goes for the best and chooses the women he wants to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
*   **Puts principles first**: A man of value places his principles above everything, including the woman he's with, and is not afraid to step back if they are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He is confident in his worth and ready to stand alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Creating [[Creating attraction through uncertainty | Uncertainty]] and Proving Worth

Women tend to value men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. When a man doesn't react like an average man, she begins to perceive something special about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
This can be achieved by:
*   **Not being an "open book"**: Don't be easily read <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Showing interest, then disinterest**: A "high value man" might compliment a woman but then express a reservation, like "you're pretty sure, but I'm not convinced we get along. You seem like too much of a goody two shoes for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This unexpected response provokes a strong emotional reaction and leaves her wondering, making her curious and eager to learn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Challenging her**: When a woman has to work for a man's attention, she becomes incredibly curious because he isn't afraid to challenge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This categorizes him as different and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Authenticity and Abundance Mentality

A common mistake is modifying one's behavior or lifestyle to fit a woman's preferences, stemming from a fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Changing to suit a woman's preferences sends a message that she is of higher value and that one needs to change to match her value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Do not alter who you are**: If she doesn't appreciate certain aspects of you, she doesn't deserve you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. If she can't accept you as you are, she's the one who needs to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Shape your own reality**: A high-value man is not overly concerned with others' opinions or judgments; he shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **See abundance, not scarcity**: He understands there is no shortage of attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a> and doesn't fixate on one woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If one woman rejects him, he knows there are many other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

Ultimately, understanding these psychological principles and applying them in practice is crucial for leveling up one's dating game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

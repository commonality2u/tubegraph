The dynamics of romantic relationships can be understood through two primary stages: the hunting stage and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. These stages form the foundation for fostering emotional chasing, where a woman develops genuine feelings and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Understanding the Dynamic: Hunt, Then Be Chased

In essence, the man begins in the hunting phase, providing initial attention or "value," which then leads to the woman craving and seeking that attention herself, thereby entering the chasing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This process occurs subconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## The Hunting Phase: Taking Initiative

The hunting phase is characterized by the man taking initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. As a man, your role in the dating market is to be the "chooser," selecting the girl you desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This means:
*   Initiating conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Taking the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   Asking her out on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Asking for a Date: Hunter vs. Follower

While you take the initiative to hunt, it's crucial not to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. The way you ask for a date can subtly communicate whether you are a hunter or a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Follower Questions:** These put the decision-making power in her hands, asking her to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   "When can I see you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>
    *   "When are you free?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
    *   "What do you like to do for fun?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
    *   "Where do you want to go for our date?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>
    *   "Would you like to go out with me sometime?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
    *   "Are you free on Saturday?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

*   **Hunter Statements:** Instead of asking what she wants, you tell her what you're going to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever; you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
    *   "Message me; I've got a fun idea." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   "Put your number in my phone; let's stay in touch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   "We should grab a drink the next time we're both free. Let me know what your week looks like." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

A woman desires a man who knows what to do and acts on it, rather than one who timidly asks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Your confidence in leading her will make her feel more comfortable following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

### Handling Date Refusals

If you ask a girl out and she provides an excuse for not being able to meet on a specific day (e.g., "I have to meet a friend on Sunday"), do not suggest another day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Simply respond with: "All right, no problem. Let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### Post-Meeting Communication

After meeting or a date, avoid sending messages or trying to talk to her immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Instead, take a step back and after about a week, send a message to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Stick to this system of initiating contact once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

If she messages you during this phase, it is acceptable to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The rule is that *you* only initiate contact once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Continue this pattern until she starts messaging you daily, indicating she's developing feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### During the Date

The primary goal during a date is to increase the energy of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

#### Punctuality
*   **Her Punctuality:** Do not wait more than 10 minutes for a girl who is late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Leaving if she's significantly late holds her accountable and shows you have other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Your Punctuality:** While some suggest showing up late on purpose to make her chase, being on time is generally a better approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Women are more perceptive now and may catch onto such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

#### Conversation
All conversation during the date should aim for an emotional impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Avoid common, boring questions like "What do you do for work?" or "How was your day?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Instead, ask questions that resonate emotionally and set you apart:
*   "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>
*   "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
*   "If you were guaranteed not to fail, what would you want to become?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
*   "Who is the person you care about the most in your life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>

#### The Kiss Test
When the conversation reaches a high level of emotional involvement, you can perform a "kiss test" to gauge her readiness for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. If she's emotionally charged, she's unlikely to refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

#### Ending the Date
Ensure the date doesn't become boring by ending it when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having a great time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. The final step is to leave without promising another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This helps [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintain mystery]] and avoids the common mistake of saying "let's meet again" or "I'll call you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## [[Transitioning to the chasing phase | Transitioning to the Chasing Phase]]

Continue giving her space and meeting once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. You will know you've successfully transitioned to the [[transitioning_to_the_chasing_phase | chasing phase]] when she starts messaging you daily, calling you, and consistently wanting to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. At this point, she begins to pursue you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. However, it's crucial not to distance yourself too early in the hunting phase, as she hasn't developed feelings yet and may lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Distancing yourself should only happen once she is already attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Remember, the goal is to be the hunter, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

This guide provides techniques for approaching women and initiating conversations to obtain contact information, emphasizing confidence, strategic approaches, and specific opening lines that aim for a positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Mental Preparation and Mindset

Maintaining a calm and relaxed demeanor is crucial before approaching someone, as nervousness can convey a lack of confidence and lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. To overcome anxiety, taking action is the best way to build confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Building Confidence: The "Ask for Time" Exercise
To ease into approaching women, start with small interactions instead of immediately jumping into full conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. A simple exercise involves approaching 10 women daily and asking them for the time, ensuring you are not wearing a watch and your cell phone is off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This exercise can significantly boost confidence, making you feel more at ease after a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Environment

Selecting the appropriate location for an approach is important.

### Places to Avoid
*   **Nightclubs**: These environments are generally not ideal for beginners due to high competition from other men, women often being on guard from frequent approaches, and loud music making [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversation]] difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### Recommended Locations
*   **Calmer spots**: Parks, malls, and coffee shops are more suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Hobby classes**: Yoga, salsa dancing, or aerobics classes often have a higher ratio of women to men, providing more opportunities with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   **Other options**: Restaurants, public libraries, or malls also offer suitable environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## The Approach Strategy

### The 5-Second Rule
Once you identify a woman you'd like to approach, do so within 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Delaying increases the likelihood of your brain creating excuses, leading to hesitation, nervousness, and potentially not approaching at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Optimal Approach Direction
*   **Never from the front**: Approaching directly allows her to anticipate your intentions and raise her "wall of resistance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Never from behind**: This can startle her, causing her to instantly avoid you and potentially ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Always from the side**: This is the most effective approach as it does not startle her, nor does she fully see you coming, preventing her from putting up her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

### Non-Threatening Posture
When approaching from the side, walk past her, tilt your head in her direction, and begin the [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Ensure your chest is facing the other direction, meaning you are talking over your shoulder. This non-threatening posture makes her more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Effective Conversation Openers

Direct approaches and "witty pickup lines" are typically ineffective as women are "strongly programmed to turn down every approach of this kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Such approaches often lead women to assume you are only looking for casual sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. The key is to make her comfortable in your presence before attempting to move forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### Avoid Canned Openers
While some specific openers are suggested, avoid being overly rigid with memorized lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Always observe the woman and the environment, adapting your approach to be as natural as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Non-Direct Openers to Get Comfortable
These openers are designed to demonstrate you are not immediately "hitting on" them, lowering their defenses:

*   **The "Cell Phone Story" Opener**:
    1.  Pretend to be on your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    2.  As you pass by your target, look over your shoulder and pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    3.  Holding the phone to your ear, say, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    4.  Then, to her, say, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men. Is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    5.  After her response, hang up and say, "I am in a hurry, but my friend said never to trust anything a female says, half the time she would be lying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    6.  When she disagrees, you can say, "Yeah, I mean it can't apply to all females." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> This successfully opens the conversation and gets her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Stating you're in a hurry also lowers her defenses and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **Contextual Openers (e.g., at a restaurant)**:
    *   If she is eating or drinking, you can ask, "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>
    *   Follow up with, "I'm new to this place and can't really figure out what to order. I think I should order this dish; is there anything else you can suggest?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>

*   **Observational Openers (e.g., commenting on attire)**:
    *   Observe what she's wearing and comment on it. For example, "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on, what's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>
    *   Follow up with, "Yeah, it caught my attention, that's why I asked you about it. By the way, I'm John." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

*   **Guessing / Assumption Openers**:
    *   Instead of asking "What do you do?" or "Where do you come from?", make a guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   Example: "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> If she asks why, explain: "Well, you have the Californian look about you. Look at the way you're dressed, I have a friend who dresses exactly like you and she is from California too. All you guys tend to dress like Barbie dolls. Why is that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
    *   The key is that your guess or assumption will prompt her to ask "Why do you say that?", helping you open the [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversation]] successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Beyond the Opener: Keeping the Conversation Going

After the opener, it's crucial to avoid awkward silences and transition the [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversation]] to spark strong emotional attraction, not just casual talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Techniques such as the "qualifying technique," "listen like a therapist," body language, the "push and pull technique," and creating mystery are all relevant for this stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Engaging the Group (if applicable)
If approaching a woman in a group, instead of focusing solely on your target, spend more time talking to her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This makes your target feel a bit jealous and curious, as you are making her work for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

*   **Example**:
    1.  Ask your target, "Hey, are they your friends?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
    2.  If she says yes, respond, "Be a good girl, introduce me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>
    3.  Once introduced, start talking more to one of her friends and completely avoid your target for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This often results in the target trying harder to get your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

## Physical Touch as Escalation

Physical touch significantly doubles the impact of what you say and is essential for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. If a girl allows you to touch her, it means her defenses are down, allowing for further physical escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### Easy Physical Touch Routines
*   **Hands**: Stare at her hands, grab her fingers, and say, "Oh nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
*   **Forehead**: Stare at her forehead, say "You have something on your forehead," then lightly clean it with your fingers and say, "Okay, all clean now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>
*   **Hair**: Stare at her hair, comment on its color or style, then touch it and ask, "Is this real hair?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>
*   **High Five**: Say something like, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team, give me a high five," then give a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Obtaining Contact Information

If you've built sufficient attraction and had a good [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | conversation]], getting her phone number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The "Curiosity & Urgency" Method
1.  Transition to sharing an interesting story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
2.  During the story, say, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," then continue your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
3.  Keep her curious about what you noticed until the story ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
4.  When she asks again, check the time and say, "Oh, I'm running late, I have to go." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>
5.  Hand her your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
    *   This method leverages her curiosity and ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. You can even call immediately to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Providing a Motive
Always provide a clear motive for her to give you her number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Example Motive**: "My friends are having this party on Saturday, it's one of the coolest events which happens only once a year. I have free passes, you should come." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> Then, hand her your phone and say, "Here, punch in your number, I'll let you know the timings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>

Asking randomly for a number (e.g., "Can I have your phone number?") will often lead to rejection or her forgetting you later because insufficient [[creating_emotional_attachment_through_conversation | attraction]] was built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

### Exiting After Getting the Number
The moment you receive her phone number, it's important to exit the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Lingering can make it awkward and potentially reverse the [[creating_emotional_attachment_through_conversation | attraction]] you've created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

To attract women, it is essential to cultivate two contrasting personalities, rather than just one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This approach aims to create intrigue and reinforce perception of your strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Why Have Contrasting Personalities?

Having opposing personality traits helps to keep a woman engaged and thinking about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. If your personality is consistently one-dimensional, such as always being the "strong man" 100% of the time, she may perceive it as forced and not believe in your strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

By incorporating an opposite side, you can:
*   **Create Confusion and Curiosity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>: When a woman observes unexpected behavior that contrasts with your typical persona, it causes her to ponder "who is this person really?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This constant reflection leads her to think about you frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This strategy is part of [[creating_psychological_intrigue_in_relationships]].
*   **Reinforce Strength** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>: Women are naturally attracted to strong men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Paradoxically, showcasing a less rigid side can affirm your underlying strength, as it demonstrates confidence and authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Increase Mysteriousness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>: An unpredictable blend of traits makes you more mysterious, prompting her to delve deeper into understanding you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Practical Application

Examples of contrasting personalities include:
*   **Kindness with a Darker Side** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>: If you are generally kind, incorporate a "darker more mischievous side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This can be seen as an alternative to the [[nice_guy_versus_bad_boy_stereotypes_in_dating]].
*   **Composed with Spontaneity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>: If you possess a strong, calm, and composed personality, allow moments of unexpected spontaneity. For instance, if a song plays loudly while walking with her, suddenly start dancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This unpredictable behavior will confuse her initially but make her think about you constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

By consciously adding a contrasting side to your personality, you can achieve surprising results in attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This principle is a core aspect of [[the_role_of_opposites_in_romantic_attraction]] and is key to [[creating_mixed_emotions_in_a_relationship]].

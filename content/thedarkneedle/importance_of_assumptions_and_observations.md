When initiating conversations, particularly with women, using assumptions and observations—often referred to as "cold reads"—is extraordinarily effective in building connection and engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach helps to overcome the initial hurdle of the "introduction phase," which is frequently the hardest stage and where men often lose attractiveness before the conversation truly begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## The "Magic Phrase"

The "magic phrase" is a formula designed to make any woman interested in talking to you and wanting to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, granting you "extraordinary power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This phrase involves transforming a question into a statement about the woman, including an assumption about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

Traditional introductions often lead men to bombard women with boring "get to know you" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This "interview mode" is dull for both parties and shifts the power dynamic of the conversation to the woman, as the man is trying to make it enjoyable for her while she waits for him to entertain her or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Why Assumptions and Observations Work

Using statements and observations instead of questions shifts the conversational power to the man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This is based on a "golden rule" to remember: "use statements instead of questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

When you use a statement with an assumption about her:
*   **Focuses on Her:** The subject of the sentence is the woman herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. People, especially women, love to talk about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This immediately "hits a sensitive cord" and raises her interest in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Opens a Topic:** Instead of merely requesting a piece of information (like "Where are you from?"), a statement opens a topic that matters to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This is akin to someone discussing a topic you love, instantly engaging you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Creates Curiosity:** Regardless of whether your assumption is correct or incorrect, the woman becomes curious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. She'll wonder how you knew or why you made that assumption, leading her to think and analyze the situation, which significantly increases her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Avoids Interview Mode:** This approach prevents the conversation from feeling like an interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Instead of just requesting information, you are "adding something to the conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Builds Familiarity and Comfort:** Speaking in statements, rather than questions, can create feelings of familiarity and comfort with someone you've just met, similar to how conversations flow with friends or family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Encourages Engagement:** This method encourages people to open up and share more about themselves freely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **Shifts Conversational Power:** By using statements, the conversation transforms from you trying to impress her and asking questions to her wanting to ask you and learn why you said what you said or made that assumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

## How to Formulate Assumptions and Observations (Cold Reads)

The rule is simple: Anytime you think of asking a question, turn it into a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This second component of the magic sentence is called "cold reads" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Examples of Converting Questions to Statements with Assumptions:

*   **Instead of:** "Where are you from?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
    *   **Say:** "You don't seem like you're from here. Are you European?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
*   **Instead of:** "What do you do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
    *   **Say:** "You seem like a creative person, I bet you work in design." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>
*   **Instead of:** "Where did you grow up?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>
    *   **Say:** "You don't seem like you grew up around here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>

Women appreciate hearing opinions about themselves and become interested in what led you to your guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. It's crucial to make sure the assumption you make is reasonable and accurate; avoid saying anything random <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

Using statements, sharing observations, and making cold reads leads to more engaging, interesting, and fun conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. It allows you to talk to women in a way that doesn't bore them but instead engages, interests, and intrigues them, while simultaneously creating feelings of comfort and familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

While this approach significantly increases a woman's interest, a crucial element to elevate her interest to a higher level is through emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. [[importance_of_emotional_questioning | Emotional connection]] is built on feelings, not merely words or commonalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Exploring her feelings and emotions, rather than just facts, helps to build this connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

Many men face challenges in their love lives due to a lack of proper [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | understanding of dating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This isn't their fault, as society hasn't provided an instruction manual for dealing with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The modern dating landscape, amplified by social media and dating apps, has led to women receiving hundreds of approaches, potentially contributing to a perception of superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. If a man isn't tall, well-built, handsome, and financially stable, a woman might see herself as superior and look down on him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Dating Marketplace

Dating can seem confusing but becomes clearer when viewed from a broader perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Dating is a marketplace with governing laws, much like an economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These aren't strict rules but general principles and patterns that are often true, resulting from millions of years of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Going against this evolutionary momentum leads to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The most effective strategies align with these laws, not against them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

The laws of the relationship economy are rooted in the primal biological instinct to reproduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Men and women have evolved different strategies to fulfill this instinct, which often conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In early human times, men's best strategy was to impregnate many women, while women's best strategy was to reject many men and secure commitment from one man for long-term security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. These ancient primal drives still shape human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

This leads to a fundamental conflict:

> Women are The Gatekeepers of sex, men are The Gatekeepers of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Women use sex to attract men and secure their commitment, while men use the promise of commitment to attract women and gain a sexual relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. In the relationship market, sex and commitment are like currency, exchanged resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Understanding Commitment as Your Currency

Men's "currency" in the relationship market is commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. There are four levels of commitment:
*   **Level One: Your Attention and Approval** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>
    *   This is what a woman seeks when she first becomes aware of your presence in the relationship market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Level Two: Non-exclusive Dating** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>
    *   You both decide you like each other and start spending time together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Level Three: Explicit Exclusive Relationship** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>
    *   You both clearly agree to be in a committed, exclusive relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Level Four: Marriage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
    *   The ultimate commitment, a dream for most women from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The "ego problem" often appears at Level One, before you both decide you're interested in each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. If you give a woman your attention and approval too easily at this stage, she won't value you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many men fail by giving women too much attention simply because they find them attractive, leading to undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This includes complimenting her looks immediately, always agreeing, overloading her with praise, or giving her significantly more attention than other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Your attention and approval are valuable resources that women desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Just as you're not entitled to a woman's body or sexual relationship, women are not entitled to your attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. These should only be given to a girl who invests her time and energy in talking to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This selective approach makes you valuable and worth pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. To maintain [[setting_boundaries_and_maintaining_standards_in_dating | boundaries]] and prevent her ego from overshadowing you, you must value your commitment because it is your currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## Elevating Your Status

When a woman's ego makes her see herself as above you, the goal is not to give in or try to bring her down, but to elevate yourself above her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This is achieved by [[developing_a_confident_mindset | placing a high value on yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Success with women is largely a [[mindset_shifts_for_dating_success | state of mind]]; she feels what you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 1. Winning the Game of Chicken

The "game of chicken" is a challenge where two people head towards each other to see who backs down first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. In relationships and conversations, someone always surrenders first, handing over their power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This happens when you prioritize the other person's value over your own, causing you to "blink first," give up your position, or hand over your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

"Blinking" or surrendering means:
*   Backpedaling when you sense you've said something "wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Changing your confident demeanor into a "nice guy" act when a woman expresses dislike for "players" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Ironically, "players" often succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   Your mind going blank when a woman yawns or frowns during your [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Hesitating before kissing a girl because you're unsure if she wants it, prioritizing her desire over your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

> People notice and respect you instantly when they realize they can't intimidate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

When a woman senses you're not intimidated by her, she assumes you're better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Men who succeed with women often do so because women know they cannot control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Your status is defined by your attitude towards yourself and women, and by your [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]] and courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. You must be willing to play the game of chicken and never back down first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. A woman assesses your status based on your attitude and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

For example, if you state a preference (e.g., liking a YouTuber) and she disagrees, do not back down, retreat, or feel the need to justify yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Justifying your opinions, preferences, or interests signals that her opinion of you matters more than your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### 2. Communicating from a Position of Implicit Status (Non-Reactive)

The best way to communicate [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | confidence]] and power without boasting or seeming arrogant is by being non-reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

**Examples of Reactive Communication:**
*   **Criticism**: If a woman criticizes your attire, reacting by explaining or trying to justify your choice (e.g., "a lot of girls like these sneakers") is reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. Even a clever, defensive remark (e.g., "it's a good thing I'm not trying to impress you") is still a reaction, giving her control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Requests**: If a girl asks you to buy her a drink and you refuse by trying to be clever or edgy, you are still reacting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Compliments**: If a woman compliments you (e.g., "I like your sneakers"), reacting by getting nervous, explaining where you bought them, or feeling an immediate need to compliment her back demonstrates reactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

**Examples of Non-Reactive Communication:**
*   **Criticism**: When a woman critiques your clothing, stay completely calm and simply say, "Thanks for the advice," then continue the conversation as if nothing happened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **Compliments**: When a woman compliments you, simply say, "Thanks, that's kind of you," and carry on the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

This non-reactive style conveys high status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. A woman notices when you are unaffected by what she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. This approach contributes to [[overcoming_rejection_and_maintaining_attraction | maintaining attraction]] and self-worth.

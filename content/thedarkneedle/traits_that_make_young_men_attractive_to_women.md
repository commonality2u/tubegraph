The most attractive man to women is a young man who possesses the traits commonly found in an older guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. These [[personality_traits_that_make_women_attached | certain traits that if you possess them will make any woman in the world obsess over you]] to the point where she won't even understand where that feeling is coming from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Many women are attracted to the idea of being with an older man, not because of superficial reasons like money, but because [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction is not something logical]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Just as a man is naturally drawn to a younger woman, a woman is naturally drawn to an older man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A young man who possesses these traits and [[psychology_of_attracting_women | makes a woman feel the same emotions]] she would with an older man will be more attractive than any other man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## 1. Obsession with a True Passion

Older men often possess a trait not commonly found in young men: an obsession with something specific, a clearly defined passion or hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This passion is something that becomes more important than anything else, discovered after exploring and experimenting with life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

While having a passion is always an [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attractive trait that draws women in]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>, the type of passion an old man has will multiply a man's attractiveness tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Defining True Passion
True passion is enjoyed purely for its own sake, without caring about the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. It's about engagement through creativity and production, not just consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Pleasure can be derived from two main sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>:
*   **Consumption:** Enjoying things like playing video games, watching movies, or eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. These are generally not considered attractive hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Production and Creativity:** Enjoying activities that involve creation and effort, like programming, gardening, cooking, building a strong physique, hiking, going to the gym, martial arts, painting, pottery, or metalworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This type of passion [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracts women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

### Displaying Your Passion
[[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attraction]] is emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>, so simply stating you have a hobby won't create attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. There are two ways to showcase this trait:

1.  **Prioritize your hobby over her:** Demonstrate that your passion is important by scheduling your activities and sticking to them, even if it means declining an immediate invitation from her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This requires forcing yourself to go to your activity even if you don't feel like it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
2.  **Talk about your passion with deep emotion:** Express the feelings you get from your hobby, such as the satisfaction of reaching a goal or the enjoyment of the effort involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Don't just state it; convey your emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### Developing This Type of Hobby
If you don't currently have this kind of hobby, exploring activities that require effort yet are enjoyable can unlock a real sense of enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

## 2. Complete Confidence in Decisions

An older man becomes completely confident in his decisions due to his life experiences, reaching convictions and beliefs that are impossible to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. When he makes a decision, it is firm, and no woman can change his mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Showing Your Certainty
To display this trait, you must stick to your guns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Even when faced with difficult decisions that your partner disagrees with, and despite her pleas or arguments, you must hold your ground if you are convinced your decision is the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

An example of this is a situation where one partner wants to move to a slightly better but more expensive apartment, while the other believes staying in the current affordable place is more strategic for long-term financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Standing firm on a financial decision, prioritizing stability and long-term goals over temporary luxury, can earn a woman's respect and strengthen her trust in a man's rational decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Saying no and standing your ground, even on small matters, can make you more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## 3. Not Being Treated Like a Child

A woman will never treat an older man as if he were her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. In a relationship, a man either takes on the role of a father figure or is treated like a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. It is crucial to never allow a woman to treat you like a little child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The concept of how to give a woman the feeling that you play a fatherly role in her life is a significant topic that can be explored further in discussions about how to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract a woman]] and [[authentic_approach_to_attracting_women | make her love you effortlessly]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

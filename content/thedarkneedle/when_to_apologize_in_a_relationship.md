The concept of respect is fundamental in a relationship, but the type of respect that fosters attraction and love is different from the ordinary respect given to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

There are two types of respect in this context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>:
*   **Grandfatherly Respect**: This is the kind of respect one might feel for an elderly, kind man or for friends. It's the type of respect that keeps a man in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Emperor-like Respect**: This is a powerful, inspiring, and impressive respect, akin to what one might feel for a Roman Emperor. Men who receive this type of respect are the ones women fantasize about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. The goal is to cultivate this "Emperor-like" respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

Attractive respect is when a woman *wants* to respect you, rather than you trying to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>. This type of respect is built on two elements: power and a subtle, enjoyable form of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.

## The Role of Power
Power in a relationship means your life remains the same after meeting her as it was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay consistent, and any changes should be for your own reasons, not hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

Women often test men by trying to make them change, especially early in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. If you succumb to these tests and change your style, habits, or even friends due to her influence, you will lose your power and her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. Your opinions should also not change because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

To maintain power:
*   **Do not change for her**: Politely decline requests to change without arguing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. For example, if she dislikes an outfit, simply say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. Speak through your actions, not endless justification or debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Do not sacrifice your happiness**: Sacrificing your happiness or interests for a girl will often lead to the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. For instance, if you quit a hobby like video games solely because she told you to, you lose your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. A girl should never be the reason for your change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

## When to Apologize
A common mistake is apologizing unnecessarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>. If you didn't do anything wrong, do not apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. Always ask yourself if you actually made a mistake before apologizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

There are three types of situations regarding apologies:

### When You Are at Fault
*   **Situation 1: You didn't do anything wrong, but she's upset.**
    *   Do not apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. Instead, tease her a little and joke around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

*   **Situation 2: You made a small mistake.**
    *   Examples include forgetting her birthday or a minor gift in an established relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   Your apology should be brief: simply say "sorry" and then give her some space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
    *   If she's upset and doesn't talk, view it as a trap; don't beg for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. Let her come back to you naturally when she's ready <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.

*   **Situation 3: You made a very big mistake.**
    *   Examples include cheating or something serious and unforgivable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
    *   In this case, there's no harm in going out of your way to apologize, such as buying a gift or going to her place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

### When She Is at Fault
*   **Situation 1: Minor offense or drama from her.**
    *   Do not show any reaction, anger, or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. As a man, you shouldn't be full of drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

*   **Situation 2: She made a small mistake.**
    *   Do not get angry, but hold her accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
    *   For example, if she cancels a date last minute, respond with something like, "You're messing up your chances with me" and hang up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>.
    *   If she calls back to apologize, tell her, "Alright, I'll give you another shot. Write me an apology letter and email it to me within 24 hours," and be serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
    *   If she refuses, say "Have a nice day" and hang up, not calling her again unless she contacts you first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. She should face [[setting_boundaries_in_relationships|consequences]] for her mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>.

*   **Situation 3: She made a big mistake.**
    *   If she commits a major mistake like cheating, you should not get angry, but you should end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
    *   Forgiving her in such a situation will cause her to permanently lose respect for you, and she will never truly love you, potentially only staying to exploit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.

### Maintaining Emotional Control
Never let a girl make you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. If her actions make you react emotionally, it indicates she is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. Even if she says nasty things, do not show anger or lose your cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. Be like a rock in a storm, acting as if nothing gets to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Often, a girl might be testing you to see how you react to extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. Reacting predictably means failing the test, losing power, and losing her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. This is a crucial aspect of [[emotional_communication_in_relationships|emotional communication]].

## The Role of Fear and Investment
The type of "fear" a woman enjoys and wants to feel in a relationship is linked to her investment in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. The core principle is: Investment = Attraction = Respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

Many men mistakenly believe that their investment in a woman (e.g., expensive dates, luxury gifts) will win her over, but this often leads to the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. What truly matters is *her* investment in *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. The more time, effort, and money you spend on her, the more attached *you* become, but her feelings remain unchanged if she isn't investing in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.

To cultivate attractive respect, reverse the situation: the more she invests in you, the more attracted she will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. You still need to invest, but only enough to make her comfortable investing in you; then, let her take the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

As she starts to invest, her fear of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Humans tend to fear losing something they've invested heavily in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. This fear is the second key component of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. When power and this enjoyable fear combine, a woman will not dare to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

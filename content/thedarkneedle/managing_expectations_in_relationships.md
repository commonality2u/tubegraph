To foster deep interest and connection in a romantic pursuit, it's essential to understand and manage a partner's expectations. The goal is to make a person think about you continuously by entering their mind through two "doors": uncertainty and expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This strategy aims to create intrigue and make her constantly wonder about your intentions and next moves.

## The Door of Uncertainty

Uncertainty is key to making a woman think about you, which can lead to love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Scientifically, women are attracted to men whose emotions are somewhat mysterious, creating uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Your goal is to avoid fully revealing your feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

When interacting, a woman's subconscious seeks answers to three main questions:
*   Do you really want her? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   How much are you interested in her? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Who likes the other more? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

If you don't provide these answers, you maintain her intrigue and presence in her thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Women are perceptive and will try to gain certainty, so avoid making your intentions too clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

### Strategies to Maintain Uncertainty

To prevent her from gaining certainty, implement the following behaviors:

#### 1. Don't Compliment Her
Attractive women often have elevated egos, partly due to social media and dating apps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. They may assume your interest even from a simple interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. While she can know you're interested, she shouldn't be certain you *want* her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Avoid compliments:** Especially during the early stages of getting to know her, refrain from compliments like "you're beautiful" or "your eyes are gorgeous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Talk normally:** Interact without giving compliments or insults <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

#### 2. Don't Ask for a Date

Avoid expressing a desire for future dates or confirming enjoyment of a past one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **After a date:** Don't say "we should go out again" or "I had a great time, we should do this again sometime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   **Impact of certainty:** Expressing clear enjoyment gives her certainty, ending her intrigue and reducing the amount she'll think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Creating intrigue:** If you part ways without mentioning a next time, she'll wonder if you enjoyed it or want to see her again, prompting her to analyze the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Initial texting:** Never ask for a date at the very beginning of texting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

#### 3. Don't Ask Her for Anything

Avoid requests that signal a need for her or her affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

*   **Examples:** Don't ask for her social media, a hug, a kiss, or for her to call you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Avoid neediness:** Refrain from messages like "why don't you reply to me?" or "why don't you call and check on me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Stand out:** By not seeking her approval or affection, you differentiate yourself from many other men who do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Spark curiosity:** This behavior makes her question your interest ("Does he not like me? Why does he keep talking to me?"), leading her to think about you and desire to learn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.
*   **Balance:** Don't be overly cold or completely indifferent, as this gives a clear "no" answer, providing her with the certainty she seeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

#### 4. Don't Always Be Available

Maintaining some distance is crucial for building attraction and avoiding clinginess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

*   **Communication timing:** Don't always respond to messages immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Meeting frequency:** If you went out today, wait about a week before suggesting another outing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.
*   **Daily interaction:** Don't talk to her every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Time for reflection:** For a girl to develop feelings, she needs time apart from you to think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. She'll remember you throughout her day, and attraction builds when you're not physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Overcoming fear of being forgotten:** If you fear she'll forget you, she likely will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. In the modern world, many men are constantly available; by not being afraid to lose her, you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. She'll forget those who cling to her, but not the one who isn't afraid of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

#### 5. Trust the Process

Resist the internal urge to provide certainty, especially if she is the only person you're pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Self-control:** You will feel a desire to compliment, suggest meetings, ask for things, be constantly available, or worry about her forgetting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Develop discipline:** Have a "sense of adventure" and control these urges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This approach fosters self-control beneficial in all areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## The Door of Expectations

The second door to a girl's mind is through managing [[role_expectations_in_relationships | expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. The rule is to always be the opposite of her expectations and never let her fully predict your actions or understand you completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

### How to Defy Expectations

*   **Do the opposite:** When you create uncertainty, she'll think about you and try to predict your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Whatever she expects, do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This keeps her in an "endless loop" of thinking about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   **Break patterns:** The human mind expects repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. If you call every day, she'll expect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Therefore, always do the opposite of your usual pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   If you've gone out three times this week, go out once or not at all next week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   If you've been messaging daily, stop for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   If you always laugh with her, sometimes meet without laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Keep her guessing:** Make her feel puzzled and unable to figure you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Avoid mirroring:** Do not mirror her response times in messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This gives her control and comes across as ingenuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Instead, vary your response times: sometimes respond immediately, sometimes take your time, and other times don't reply at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Act naturally:** Do what feels right for you and don't worry about her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This approach makes you seem less interested while making you unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

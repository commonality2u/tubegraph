The core of [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | communication and attraction dynamics]] lies not just in what is said, but how it is communicated non-verbally. This concept, known as subcommunication, is paramount when seeking to [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:52">[09:30:52]</a>.

## The Power of Authentic Self-Expression

Initially, the fear of approaching someone can lead to overthinking, wondering what to say or if one might be unwelcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, pushing past this hesitation and saying what is genuinely on one's mind can lift a "huge weight" and lead to a more natural interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This authentic approach means not trying to act with fake confidence or forcing things to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>. It's about letting natural thoughts flow out and allowing the other person to see you as you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>.

### The Role of Laughter in Subcommunication

A study on the psychology of laughter suggests that loud, powerful laughter was historically associated with strong, tribal leaders who weren't afraid to draw attention to themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. Conversely, quieter laughter was adopted by weaker individuals who sought to avoid attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. While modern society often views loud laughter as impolite, the way one laughs is a developed trait, not innate, and can be consciously changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

Developing a powerful, confident laugh can significantly change social interactions and [[understanding_female_attraction | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Just as a man is drawn to a woman with an attractive laugh, a woman is instinctively attracted to a man with a strong, confident laugh, even experiencing sexual attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. Laughter is one of the most important elements in human connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### The Dangers of Excessive Seriousness

Thinking that being serious most of the time creates presence and strength is a common misconception, often influenced by media depictions of "gang leaders" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>. In reality, excessive seriousness and a lack of laughter can be detrimental to one's social life, including relationships with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. People generally prefer not to be around those who are always serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

Being spontaneous and not taking things too seriously is a crucial quality for [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Women are drawn to men who are at ease with themselves, enjoy the moment, and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. Any time attention has been captured from a girl or group of girls, it was likely due to acting naturally and not trying to appear "cool" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

## The Authentic Approach: Shameless Interest

When approaching women, many men feel nervous and try to hide it, believing they need to say specific things to compensate for feelings of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. However, relying on pre-prepared lines doesn't solve the underlying problem and can hinder comfortable [[effective_communication_with_women | communication with women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

The most effective approach is to be direct and authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. This means stating your intentions clearly, such as "Hey, you're cute, I wanted to get to know you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This is called **Shameless Interest**, where one expresses interest without any shame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. There is no need to hide attraction or pretend not to be interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>. In fact, showing clear, upfront interest, even by asking "Are you single?" upfront, makes intentions clear and eliminates "gray areas" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. This straightforwardness is simple, honest, and authentic, though it requires courage, a quality women are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

### Shameless Interest vs. Compliments

There's a significant difference between showing shameless interest and giving compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. While it's acceptable to show attraction, it's crucial not to convey that you are "entirely sold" on her or "desire her completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.

*   **Shameless Interest:** "I like your hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This conveys genuine observation and interest. You can also mention what you don't like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
*   **Compliment:** "Your hair is beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>. This is something she hears often and can lead to the "friend zone" or make you seem weak, as it hides honest interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

A "lover" expresses direct interest ("I'm interested in you"), while a "friend" gives generic compliments ("You're beautiful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## The Essence of Subcommunication

The actual words spoken when talking to women hold little value on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. [[Understanding female attraction | Attraction for a woman]] is tied to the *feeling* your words generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. When you approach directly and state your interest, it communicates confidence and a lack of concern about her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>.

Attraction is 80 to 90% non-verbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. This means *how* you say something is more important than *what* you say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | Subcommunication]] includes:
*   Tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>
*   [[body_language_and_selfconfidence_in_attracting_women | Body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>
*   Eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>
*   Breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>

Subcommunication speaks directly to the subconscious, where emotional and sexual desire originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

## The [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | Mindset]] of "Men With Options"

Women are naturally attracted to men they perceive as desirable to other women â€“ men who have multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. There are key differences in the subcommunication of men who have options versus those who don't:

*   **Men with options** assume women are attracted to them. They are used to being desired, so they project this assumption when meeting new women. If a woman isn't attracted, it doesn't bother them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.
*   **Men without many options** typically assume women aren't attracted to them due to past experiences. When they encounter even a hint of interest, they "cling" to the woman, fearing they won't find anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. They try "extra hard" to compensate for a deep-seated belief that they don't deserve the women they desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

Trying too hard subtly communicates a lack of options, which is unattractive to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>. The key is to assume attraction, look her in the eyes, introduce yourself, and state why you approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. The goal is to determine if *she* is interesting and worth *your* time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>. Over-effort works against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>.

The first words spoken are often not remembered; what truly matters is how you showed up and how you made her feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. The regret of overthinking and missing an opportunity reinforces the importance of this authentic, direct approach for [[changing_behavior_to_avoid_being_ignored_by_women | changing behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:00">[12:16:00]</a>.

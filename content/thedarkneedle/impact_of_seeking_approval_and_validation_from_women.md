Seeking approval and validation from women is a common mistake that can significantly hinder a man's success in romantic relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. This attitude fuels insecurity and often pushes women away, rather than attracting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Seeking Approval

*   **Attraction Killer**
    The moment a woman perceives that a man is seeking her approval, she is instantly turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Attraction is not something she can consciously control, and seeking validation acts as a powerful barrier to genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. A woman will not show real interest if you are constantly trying to gain her acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.

*   **Communicates Low Value**
    Constantly agreeing with a woman to keep her comfortable projects a weak vibe, indicating that you are trying to [[techniques_to_trigger_a_womans_desire_for_approval | seek her approval or permission]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Playing by all her rules and agreeing with everything she says indirectly communicates that you lack self-recognition and fear losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. Women are generally drawn to a challenge and will not find a man appealing if he agrees with them on everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

*   **Leads to the "Friend Zone"**
    Trying to solve a woman's problems is a quick way to end up in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. While listening to her problems is acceptable, actively solving them for her places you in the "provider zone," akin to a big brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This behavior subconsciously communicates low value, and she will view you as someone to turn to in times of trouble or emotional distress, but not as a potential lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Women typically seek an ear to listen, not a solution from men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

*   **Reveals Insecurity and Weakness**
    Discussing personal problems or insecurities with women is an attraction killer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. Sharing your issues or weaknesses, past failures, or ongoing struggles indirectly conveys that you are not strong enough to handle your own problems and require her help or sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. This creates a dull impression that undermines attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

    > "You should be tough enough to deal with your problems yourself. Women want to see you overcome the problem instead of just discussing it with them." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>

*   **Diminishes the Challenge**
    Confessing true feelings too early in a relationship can lead a woman to feel she has "conquered" you, removing the tension and attraction built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. When a woman knows you are interested, it can diminish her attraction, as females cannot control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a>. Keeping her "confused and insecure" by not revealing your interest too soon can help maintain attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

*   **Loss of Control**
    Getting angry or upset by a woman's actions signals a lack of control on your part, indicating that she holds power over your emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Remaining calm and composed, like "a rock in the storm," shows resilience and prevents you from failing her tests of your reactions in extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

## How to Avoid Seeking Approval

*   **Don't Put Her on a Pedestal**: Do not give a woman excessive importance solely based on her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Emphasize that you value personality over physical appearance, as personality is a rare trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. This approach makes you seem "special" or "different," which is often what women seek in a potential mate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Talk Less, Listen More**: To avoid trying to convince her of your worth, let her do most of the talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Make the conversation about her, placing her at the center of the discussion to prevent focusing on yourself and inadvertently seeking her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.
*   **Don't Always Say "Yes"**: Avoid falling into the trap of constantly agreeing to her requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Make her work a little to earn a "yes" response by setting conditions or requiring her to request more persistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. This applies to random requests, not important or urgent ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Composure**: Never allow a woman's actions to make you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. Even when faced with nasty comments, remain calm and composed, acting as if nothing affects you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. This demonstrates self-control and resilience.

Ultimately, the young man in the story illustrated many traits of a low-value male, sabotaging his chances by putting the woman on a pedestal, agreeing too much, desperately seeking her approval, confessing his feelings prematurely, attempting to solve her problems, and failing to maintain a balanced level of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. His story serves as a cautionary tale against [[the_dangers_of_seeking_approval_from_women | seeking approval and validation]].

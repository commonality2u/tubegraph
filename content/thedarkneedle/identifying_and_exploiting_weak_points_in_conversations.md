## Understanding Weak Points

Making someone obsessed with you requires triggering their "weak points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Every human has four weak points, and in 99% of people, at least one of these is significantly stronger than the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The key is to identify and use this dominant weak point to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

This process involves two steps:
1.  Learning to detect a weak point during a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  Being aware of what these weak points are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Detecting Weak Points During Conversation

Human behavior often follows a "straight line," with occasional "spikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A "spike" indicates that you have hit a sensitive nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

When conversing with someone, their tone, speech speed, attention, and presence are typically "normal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. A spike occurs when:
*   You make them laugh or bring up a topic that significantly grabs their attention, leading to a noticeable change or significant increase in their emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.
*   They repeat a phrase or sentence, often when they don't get the desired reaction from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

When a spike occurs or repetition happens, observe if it's directly related to them personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. If so, you may have found an "opening" â€“ an internal deficiency they are subconsciously waiting for someone to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Types of Weak Points and Exploitation

Once you recognize these weak points, you can pinpoint the void a person suffers from by listening to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

### 1. Thirst for Validation

Some individuals have an excessive need for appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They constantly try to prove their specialness and seek admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This is evident if they frequently:
*   Talk about their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   Retell stories of impressive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
*   Brag about attracting or keeping a partner's interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   Like to feel in control of their social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

**Exploitation: Indirect Praise**
The "bait" for this weak point is praise, but it must be given indirectly to affect their subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Direct compliments are ineffective and can make you seem insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

To give indirect praise:
*   **Seek Advice**: Ask for their advice on a problem (real or made-up). When they offer a solution, respond with, "Wow, you're absolutely right, I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This makes them feel intellectually superior and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
*   **Third-Party Validation**: If they mention an achievement, stay silent and don't react initially. They will likely ask why you asked. Then, reveal that someone else (e.g., "Henry") and you were debating their ability to do it, implying the other person thought it was a significant feat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This makes them feel validated and appreciated for being talked about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Joking Praise**: Joke about something they are proud of. For example, if they are tall, ask "How's the weather up there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. If they got a woman's number, later joke, "Dude, how did you even pull that off?" while laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This reinforces their pride indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

People with a thirst for validation are described as the easiest to manipulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### 2. Fear of Failure

Individuals with a very big, life-changing goal (e.g., getting into a competitive university, securing a difficult job) often hear positive encouragement, but an internal voice reminds them of potential failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. This fear creates a void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

**Exploitation: Emotional Reassurance and Hope**
Your goal is to make them express their fears of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. By being a good listener, they will naturally talk about these fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The best approach is not to offer solutions or advice (unless asked), but to provide emotional reassurance and lift their spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

*   **When to give advice**: Only when directly asked for guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
*   **When to just listen**: If they are venting about a past problem with no real solution, simply listen without offering solutions or changing the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **When to give reassurance**: When they are talking about a problem related to their emotions (e.g., stress, uncertainty about the future), especially concerning the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

To give proper reassurance:
1.  **Listen First**: Stay silent and let them express their worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
2.  **Provide Hope**: After they finish, tell them stories of people who were in similar or worse situations but still succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. For instance, if they fear failing a coding course, you could say your cousin "was in the same position as you and now he's an engineer at Microsoft" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. If they express exhaustion, confirm that the person in your story felt the same initially but eventually understood it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. These stories can be real or fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

Filling this void of fear can make you like a "drug they depend on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### 3. Psychological Trauma (Male Rejection)

One common psychological trauma discussed is male rejection by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Men often feel inadequate or that something is wrong with them (appearance, personality, finances) after rejection, even if the reasons were unrelated to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

**Exploitation: Indirect Reframing**
When someone you know has been rejected, you need to indirectly convince them that either the problem was with the woman, or that he is superior to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Avoid direct statements like "You're better than her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. The goal is for him to reach this conclusion himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

*   **If single**: Present facts that highlight issues with the woman. For example, mention she was in a long, failed relationship and is now depressed, or that even someone known for success with women (e.g., "Bob") was also rejected by her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   **If in a relationship**: Praise his current partner by saying she is "so much better than the one who rejected you" in terms of personality or looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

This approach makes him feel his value is rising and helps him realize the rejection was meaningless and unrelated to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### 4. Thirst for Sex (for self-protection)

This weak point cannot be exploited by men but is explained for self-protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. A woman does not experience this "thirst" in the same way a man does because sex is generally more available to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

A woman can use a man's sexual desire against him, manipulating him by holding out what he wants without fully giving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. She might keep him chasing, offering only a "small taste" when he is about to give up, then pulling it away again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Understanding this dynamic can protect men from being manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## The Addiction Mechanism

When you consistently hit someone's weak points, it's likened to giving them a drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. As the effect wears off, their brain craves more and associates the positive feeling with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This subconscious association leads them to want to talk to you and meet you again, becoming "addicted" without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

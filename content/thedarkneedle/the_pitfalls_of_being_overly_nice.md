Being "the nice guy" who constantly tries to please others can be a significant obstacle in relationships, particularly with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This behavior, often mistaken for kindness, is perceived as weakness and can lead to a lack of attraction and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35">[04:35]</a>. It is one of several [[common_mistakes_men_make_with_women | common mistakes men make with women]] that hinder success in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Illusion of Niceness as Weakness

Many men believe that being agreeable and giving everything upfront will win a woman over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31">[04:31]</a>. However, this approach often stems from a deeper place of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38">[04:38]</a>:
*   **Fear of Rejection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40">[04:40]</a>
*   **Fear of Disapproval** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>
*   **Fear of Not Being Liked** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42">[04:42]</a>

Instead of showing kindness, this behavior demonstrates weakness, which women are adept at sensing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36">[04:36]</a>. High-quality women are not looking for "pushovers" or men who hand over their power for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The man who is ready to take anything available is the one who fails the most with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. A woman wants a man who knows exactly what he wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. The [[the_importance_of_avoiding_neediness_in_interactions | needy and desperate man]] is the one who fails the most with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Embracing Strength and Boundaries

A truly good man knows how to stand his ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52">[04:52]</a> and is not afraid to say "no" without flinching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>. Masculine leadership involves leading, protecting, and even challenging a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>, which sometimes means delivering truths she may not want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04">[05:04]</a>.

> [!TIP] Real men understand how to create tension with purpose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07">[05:07]</a>, which is crucial for building desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11">[05:11]</a>.

Women naturally test boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13">[05:13]</a>. If these boundaries are not enforced, a woman will lose respect, and attraction will diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>. [[The dangers of seeking approval from women | Seeking approval]] by being the "safe option" often leads to being friend-zoned, [[consequences_and_ethics_of_manipulative_behaviors_in_relationships | manipulated]], or ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20">[05:20]</a>.

## Cultivating Power and Standards

To overcome the pitfalls of being overly nice, men must shift from operating out of approval to operating from a place of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25">[05:25]</a>. This involves:
*   **Saying "no" and meaning it without explanation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>
*   **Holding one's frame** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29">[05:29]</a>
*   **Maintaining one's edge** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30">[05:30]</a>

The ability to walk away from a situation or relationship that doesn't meet one's standards is a powerful stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31">[05:31]</a>. When a man sheds the "disease to please," he not only attracts more women but attracts *better* womenâ€”those who are drawn to strength, not submission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36">[05:36]</a>.

> [!NOTE] While it's not necessary to be a jerk to succeed, being a doormat is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43">[05:43]</a>. A man who is firm, clear, and unshakable is the one a woman respects and chooses to stay with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46">[05:46]</a>.

Subcommunication is a critical aspect of attraction, accounting for 80% to 90% of a woman's attraction to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It refers to the non-verbal cues that convey meaning and emotions, influencing how others perceive you on a subconscious level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## What is Subcommunication?
Unlike verbal communication, which focuses on the explicit words spoken, subcommunication encompasses *how* those words are delivered and the accompanying non-verbal signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Key elements of subcommunication include:
*   **Tone of voice** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   [[building_connections_through_nonverbal_communication | Body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
*   Breathing patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

These non-verbal cues communicate directly with the subconscious, which is the source of emotional and sexual desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

## Impact on Attraction
The true points of attraction for women are rooted in subcommunication, not just in the words used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. What you say when first approaching someone isn't as important as *how* you say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Women are constantly "reading" men through their subcommunication, deciding how they should feel about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. If you are not completely honest and genuine about your intentions, women can sense it in your face, body language, and subtle reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Assuming Attraction
A key difference in the subcommunication of men who have multiple options is that they assume women are attracted to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. They are accustomed to women being interested, so they naturally assume a new woman will be too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Even if she isn't, it doesn't fluster them or become a big deal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. This contrasts with men who lack options, who often assume women aren't attracted to them due to past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. They may cling to any hint of interest, believing they won't find anyone else and trying extra hard to compensate for feelings of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

### The "Trying Too Hard" Effect
When a man tries too hard to make a girl like him, he subtly communicates a lack of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This behavior is unattractive to women, who are drawn to men who have options and confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Over-effort, or trying to be cool or confident when you're not genuinely feeling it, works against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The most important thing is how you show up and the feeling you create in the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Authentic Approach
An [[effective_communication_strategies | authentic approach]] involves being spontaneous and natural, saying what comes to mind without overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. When you express genuine interest, such as stating "I like you and I want to talk to you," it communicates confidence and a lack of concern for her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. This straightforwardness creates clear understanding and avoids "gray areas" often caused by fear of showing direct interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. While this approach requires courage, girls are attracted to courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

Instead of hiding intentions or pretending not to be attracted, it's beneficial to be upfront about attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. However, there's a distinction between showing interest and being "entirely sold" on someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Showing that someone attracts you is acceptable, but demonstrating complete desire can be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. For example, saying "I like your hair" is [[techniques_for_effective_communication_in_relationships | shameless interest]], while "Your hair is beautiful" is a compliment that can put you in the friend zone or make you seem weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

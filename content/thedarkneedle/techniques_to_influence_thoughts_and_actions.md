To convince someone to see things from your perspective or to get them to do what you want, there are two primary steps: first, get inside their mind, and second, speak to their awareness by choosing the right words to influence their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept can also be applied in social interactions, such as meeting or trying to win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Building Connection: Entering the Inner Mind

The fastest way to enter someone's inner mind is by building a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This involves deliberately creating a match with another person, similar to feeling an instant bond when you "click" with someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is easier to convince someone you connect with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Your brain unconsciously processes vast amounts of non-verbal information, including facial expressions and body language (e.g., how a person sits, walks, and moves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The human body can be thought of in three parts—head, body, and feet—all sending non-verbal messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### The Body-Mood Link

The idea of making a connection is based on the principle that your body's actions affect your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. You can discern others' feelings by observing their body and facial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. If you then copy their movements, you may begin to feel similarly due to the link between body and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

**Exercise: Experiencing the Body-Mood Link**
To illustrate, try walking with your head up, smiling, and looking at the skyline for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Then, walk with your head down, pace slowed, hands in pockets, and dragging your feet for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Notice how your mood shifts solely due to changes in posture, without happy or sad thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Adapting to Someone's Mood

Since changing your posture affects your mood, copying someone else's posture can help you feel what they feel, thus understanding their state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. To connect, adjust your mood to match theirs after observing their posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Define the mood you've noticed (e.g., bored, happy, sad, curious) and name both your mood and theirs to facilitate adjustment <a class="yt
class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

**Steps to Change Someone's Mood (for practice):**
1.  Choose a pleasant person with whom you don't have a serious connection (e.g., a cashier, neighbor) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  Read the chosen person's mood using their body language and mirror their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  Immerse yourself in that mood by repeatedly thinking of the word defining it and recalling past memories when you felt that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
4.  Approach the person while maintaining this mood and speak normally until you are both on the same emotional wavelength, establishing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. You will "just feel it" when the connection is made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
5.  Once connected, gradually change your own mood to the one you desire for the other person by shifting your gestures, posture, and smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Observe their mood changing along with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This means you have influenced them at a subconscious level through nonverbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

**Caution:** There is a significant difference between adapting and imitating. Adapt subtly to aspects of others' movements without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Avoid direct mirroring, which is imitation and can cause embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Psychological Influence Through Language and Phrasing

Beyond non-verbal communication, you can improve your chances of influencing others by the way you use words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This involves using words to have a [[psychological_influence_through_language_and_phrasing | psychological effect on the other person's subconscious]] to minimize refusals and increase agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This requires making a connection first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Specific Verbal Techniques

*   **Emphasize the Obvious:** State that something is obvious to make others believe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Examples: "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Ask a Question That Is Not Really a Question:** State what you want them to agree with and add a question tag at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. The tone of your voice should decrease at the end, unlike a usual question, to avoid inviting a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   Examples: "You already know everything about that, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>, "Probably it's time for another drink, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
    *   *Caution*: This approach is useful for everyday life but not for major commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Get Them to Say Yes:** Use "let's" as a disguised order instead of questions that allow refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. The more someone says "yes," the more their mind is trained to comply, entering a "yes mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Save your main request for after they've said "yes" multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Examples: "Let's walk a bit more" vs. "Should we walk a bit more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

*   **Offer Two Options (Both Desired by You):** Provide choices where both options are suitable for your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
    *   Example: "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait, or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This avoids asking if they want to drink at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

*   **Anticipate the Future:** Tell people how you expect them to react to something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I know you'll be thrilled about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, "I know you'll want to repeat the experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

*   **Logical Leaps:** Use "therefore" or "this means that" to create a connection between two concepts, even if the connection isn't inherently true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The first concept should be true; the second is what you want others to agree with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
    *   Examples: "You're watching this video (true), this means that you like it (maybe true)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, "We've been together for 3 months; therefore, I must be serious about this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

*   **Order and Order:** Give the command you truly want first, then immediately follow it with an easier, definitely-to-be-followed command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The person will usually hear the second command and subconsciously follow the first without questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   Example: "It's late and you're tired; take out the garbage and come to bed early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

*   **The "But" Technique:** What follows the word "but" receives the most attention and emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **The Ideal Question:** Use "ideal" or "ideally" in your questions to make others focus on perfect outcomes rather than limitations, creating positive images in their minds and providing you with valuable information to influence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   Examples: "What do you ideally want?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, "Who would be your ideal candidate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. If asked in a job interview, make sure to give the impression you are that ideal candidate by using their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Tell It Without Telling It:** Express your viewpoint and create images in others' minds indirectly, without explicitly stating them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I can't tell you to leave him; the decision must be yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> (implies they should leave him), "I don't even want to think about the stress you're feeling now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a> (draws attention to their stress).
    *   Giving orders by telling someone *not* to do what you actually want them to do: "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a> (implies they *should* worry about paying you back).

*   **"Yes Means No" (Indirect Offers):** Offer to do something you don't really want to do using phrases like "I could... if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I could give you a ride home if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

*   **"It's Not Important But It Is" (Indirect Feedback):** Use phrases like "I know that you won't consider my advice but..." or "Maybe you won't care but..." to deliver feedback that the other person might not like or want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I know that you won't consider my advice, but I'm worried about your unhealthy lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, "Maybe you won't care, but your deodorant is too weak" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   **"Shut Up and Listen" (Indirect Demand for Attention):** A pleasant way to demand attention using phrases like "I don't know if you realize..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, "I don't know if you realize how long I've been waiting my turn" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

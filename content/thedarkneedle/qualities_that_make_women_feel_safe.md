A core element for a woman to deeply connect with a man is her feeling of [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | safety]] with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This sense of security is crucial for a woman to start loving, becoming attached to, and staying connected to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Without it, relationships can fail, as demonstrated by a friend's marriage that ended because his wife "didn't feel safe with him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Historical Perspective on Female Safety Needs

Looking back to the era of primitive humans, women lived with men and their children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. For a woman to feel safe, a man needed specific qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. While strength and height might seem obvious, they weren't the sole determinants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. A strong man might flee from danger, leaving his family vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Conversely, a seemingly weaker man who stood and fought showed true protective capability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Through such experiences, women became genetically programmed to seek a man with the "ability to be dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## The "Ability to be Dangerous"

For a woman to [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | feel safe with you]], she needs to perceive that you have the capacity to cause harm if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This psychological trigger explains why some women are [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | attracted to "bad boys"]] or even criminals: they appear strong and display a "dangerous side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Not a Literal "Bad Boy"

It's crucial to understand that this does *not* mean you should become a literal "bad boy" or a criminal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, as being a "bad boy" is not a successful long-term relationship strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Instead, you should adopt the [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | traits that attract women]] in "bad boys" while maintaining your own morals and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The right way to show a woman you can protect her is by demonstrating your ability to [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | set boundaries]] for her when needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. If she can [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | disrespect]] or manipulate you, she will perceive you as incapable of protecting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The man who possesses the "ability to be dangerous" also embodies two key qualities:

### 1. Fearlessness

A woman will know you're not afraid by observing that you are not afraid *of her* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. If your behavior resembles a "little boy who's terrified of upsetting his mom," it indicates a lack of control in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. No rational woman is [[understanding_female_attraction | attracted to her child]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Women subconsciously test men, wanting them to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They prefer to feel [[understanding_female_attraction | intense attraction]] and [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | admiration]] for a strong, authoritative man over contempt for a fearful, approval-seeking one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

A primary indicator of fear is lying to a woman to avoid upsetting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. If her emotional state dictates your honesty, you are living for her approval, not your principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Common lies men tell to avoid upsetting women:
*   "I'll be there soon." (When you're late) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   "Yes, I did it already." (When you forgot or haven't started) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   "I didn't know that was today." (When you knew but hoped to dodge it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>
*   "I'm fine, everything's okay." (When you're upset) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   "It didn't cost that much." (When you're afraid she won't approve of a purchase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>
*   "I didn't have a signal/my phone was off/I missed your call." (When you screened her call) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>

Avoid these small lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Stop apologizing excessively and do not fear her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The moment you fear a woman's reaction is the moment you lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. When you tell a woman the truth, even if she doesn't like it, her [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] to you increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### 2. Ability to Confront

To make a woman [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | feel safe]] with you, you must also demonstrate the ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This means being willing to confront *her* and express yourself clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Avoid being a "yes man" who agrees with everything his woman says or does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Women will test you to see if you stick to your opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. They want to know if you are honest with yourself, capable of disagreeing, yet still able to get along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Having your own preferences and expressing them earns a woman's [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | respect and admiration]] and makes her [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | feel safe with you]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

**Examples of Confrontation:**

*   **Respectful Disagreement:** If you loved a movie she hated, state your opinion firmly but respectfully: "Well, you're entitled to your opinion, but I still think it was a spectacular movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Playful Confrontation:** If your relationship allows for it, use humor: "Wow, and here I thought you had good taste. Oh well, I guess I'm the cultured one in this relationship, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>
*   **Setting Boundaries:** If she gives you a hard time for disagreeing, make it clear you're entitled to your opinion: "Look, you asked for my opinion, and I gave it. If you don't like hearing the truth from me, I suggest you think twice before asking what I think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This sets [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

If, after expressing your opinion, she tries to push you into an argument, refuse to argue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. Say firmly and lovingly, "I won't argue about this," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. Don't be afraid to express your opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

When you demonstrate these qualities—fearlessness and the ability to confront—a woman will internally [[psychological_triggers_for_women_in_relationships | feel that you have the ability to confront]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Over time, this builds a unique sense of [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | security]], and she will see you as a man she can rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. Do not be overly nice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>; instead, be strong out of love for her, because women desire men who are strong so they can [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | feel safe]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The feeling of [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | safety]] is paramount among the [[psychological_triggers_for_women_in_relationships | emotions that keep a woman attached]] to you long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

The ability to flirt is a crucial part of seduction, as it shifts an interaction from platonic to romantic, making it clear that a man has sexual intent and is not just looking to be a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## Types of Men and Their Flirting Abilities

When discussing [[pushpull_flirting_techniques | flirting]], men can be categorized into three groups based on their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>:

*   **The Unskilled Flirt (Friend Zone)**: This type of man doesn't know how to flirt at all and often ends up in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Their conversations tend to be 100% platonic, lacking any spark or attraction, similar to two male friends chatting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.
*   **The Awkward Flirt**: This man attempts to flirt but comes across as awkward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This often stems from making common [[mistakes_in_flirting | mistakes in flirting]], such as being too obvious or using non-sexual banter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   **The Skilled Flirt**: This individual knows how to flirt effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. They understand how to influence a woman's mind to be remembered as a high-value person, rather than just someone chasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Common [[mistakes_men_make_while_interacting_with_women | Mistakes Men Make While Interacting with Women]]

Most men make similar [[mistakes_in_flirting | mistakes in flirting]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:

*   **Being Too Obvious**: This approach kills mystery and excitement, making interactions less intriguing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. For instance, directly complimenting a woman's physical looks can suggest you've never been with an attractive woman and eliminates any mystery about your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   **Overly Direct Sexual Intent**: Women are socialized to avoid being perceived as promiscuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. When a man is too direct about his sexual intentions with a woman he has recently met, most women will create an excuse or disappear, activating their "anti-slut defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
*   **Using Non-Sexual Banter**: Many men use the same kind of non-sexual banter with women that they use with their male friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This fails to create sexual undertones or tension in the interaction, akin to giving a high-five instead of holding hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Playing It Safe**: Avoiding bold, riskier moves results in interactions that lack sexual tension or undertones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Becoming an Irresistible Flirt

To avoid common [[mistakes_in_flirting | mistakes in flirting]] and become more irresistible, men should focus on the following techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>:

### [[subtlety_in_flirting | Subtlety]]
Great [[subtlety_in_flirting | flirting]] relies on implication rather than explicit statements, which fosters mystery and intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This approach shows a woman that you are not desperate or "chasing after anything with two legs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. For example, instead of saying, "I bet you'd look amazing in a sports bra," a subtle approach would be, "Really? Well, believe it or not, I love girls who love sports bras" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### Plausible Deniability
Provide a woman with a way to rationalize potential sexual encounters as something that "just happened," rather than a premeditated decision to have sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This helps her avoid feelings of shame or being perceived as promiscuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. An example would be inviting her to your place to "play a round" on an "awesome pool table" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Passing Women's Tests
High-quality women will test men to gauge their confidence and see if they can be thrown off balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. These tests often come as snide remarks, tricky questions, or unreasonable requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

*   **Agree and Amplify**: The easiest way to pass these tests is to agree with her statement and exaggerate it to an absurd level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   *Her:* "I bet you use that line on all the girls."
    *   *You:* "Yeah, I wake up every morning surrounded by women. Is that good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
    *   *Her:* "How many women have you slept with?"
    *   *You:* "Today? Not that many." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>
    *   *Her:* "Buy me a drink."
    *   *You:* "Sure, would you like my ATM pin too?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

### Act Like You're the Prize
Most attractive women are accustomed to being pursued by many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. You can reverse this dynamic by playfully implying that she is the one chasing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This positions you as the prize and frames her as the pursuer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

*   *Her:* "I love sports bras."
*   *You:* "Don't try to make me think of you in a sports bra." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
*   *Her:* (Inadvertently staring at you)
*   *You:* "Are you trying to seduce me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
*   *You:* "I live just around the corner, we can go and grab a drink at my place, but only if you promise not to try anything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>

### [[pushpull_flirting_techniques | Pushpull Flirting]]
[[pushpull_flirting_techniques | Pushpull flirting]] involves a playful mix of pushing a woman away and pulling her back in, both physically and verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This creates excitement, keeps her engaged, and demonstrates that you are a high-value man who isn't easily won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

*   *You:* "You're too cute for me to handle. Shoo!" (Pulls her in by calling her cute, pushes her away by telling her to go away) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
*   *You:* "You're awesome, you're like my little sister." (Pulls her in with a compliment, pushes her away with a non-romantic comparison) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

This dynamic creates intrigue because women, like men, tend to lose interest when something is obtained too cheaply and esteem it too lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This helps explain why women might lose interest in "nice guys" but be drawn to "bad boys" who play hard to get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Imply Her Intentions
Playfully accuse her of trying to seduce you, even in innocent conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. This teasing is often enjoyed by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

*   *Her:* (Discussing home electronics installation)
*   *You:* "Are you already trying to bring me to your place? I'm not surprised." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>

### Use Sexual Allusions
While you cannot directly state you are a good lover, you can use sexual allusions to imply it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

*   *Her:* "Wow, you're good at that!" (After you've made her a cocktail)
*   *You:* (Making eye contact) "I'm good at many things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>

### Encourage Her to "Use" You
Reverse the common dynamic where women accuse men of using them for sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Playfully suggest she is using you.

*   *You:* (After doing something for her) "So, you're already using me? I can already see that soon you'll be using me for other things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a> This is an innocent, funny, and non-offensive way to bring sex into the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

Attracting women is a skill, not an inherent trait tied to appearance or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. As an individual, you don't inherently need anything specific to attract women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Failure in dating or being single is often due to a lack of knowledge about how to attract a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. It's important not to take dating failures personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Deconstructing Misconceptions in Dating

Contrary to misleading advice from [[role_of_social_media_and_dating_apps_in_relationships | social media influencers]] suggesting one needs to be tall, muscular, wealthy, or have a beard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, attraction is rooted in factors that have evolved over millions of years, independent of modern ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Personal experience shows that understanding female psychology can lead to significant success in dating, regardless of initial looks or financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. Many men with diverse appearances are seen with beautiful women, indicating that attraction is not solely based on conventional physical or financial attributes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

The ability to attract women comes from [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | understanding how women think]] and what factors influence their attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. If you are currently single, it's likely due to certain behaviors that prevent women from considering a relationship with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## The Dynamics of the Dating Market

In the dating market, a woman's "currency" is often considered sex, while a man's "currency" is commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### Man's Role in Choosing the Field

When interacting with a woman, there are always two potential goals: sex or a committed relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. As a man, you biologically determine the direction of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   If the goal is sex or a one-night stand, the woman is perceived as the "prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   If the goal is commitment or a long-term relationship, the man becomes the "prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

It is generally easier for men to operate in the "commitment field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. While natural and normal to desire sex, it should not be your primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Being the Prize: Sexual vs. Horny

To play in the commitment field, you must:
1.  **Program your subconscious to not want "just sex"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. This means being "sexual" but not "horny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Sexual:** Being comfortable and unashamed discussing sexual topics, viewing it as normal and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
    *   **Horny:** Being sexually needy, aggressively seeking sex, having an agenda, and being dependent on a specific outcome from the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
    Never appear desperate for sex, as this places you in the "sex field," making the woman the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A woman will not typically engage with a man if she feels she is the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

2.  **Understand and internalize that you are the prize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. If you easily give your attention and approval, you will not be valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. This includes excessive compliments, constant agreement, or giving disproportionate attention just because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. You should be selective with your attention and approval, giving your time and energy only to those who invest similarly in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This approach makes you valuable and worth chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Common Pitfalls to Avoid

### The Friend Zone

The notion that you must become a good friend before a good lover, as depicted in romantic movies, is false <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. In reality, once you are in the friend zone, a woman will rarely see you as a potential romantic partner, treating you more like a "girlfriend in male form" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Attempting to pursue a romantic relationship from the friend zone can often lead to the woman avoiding you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Ineffectiveness of Compliments

Showering women with compliments is often ineffective and can make you seem like just another man seeking sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Attractive women live in a state of "abundance" regarding male options, constantly receiving attention and compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Therefore, simply telling an attractive woman she is beautiful is not new or impressive to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, and she may categorize you as just another guy trying to gain her interest for one reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

## Understanding Female Psychology: Emotion Over Logic

When dating, interacting, or in a relationship, women primarily react based on their emotions rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Your words matter less than the emotional impact they create <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. For example, if a woman calls you skinny and you respond logically by explaining you're working out, her attraction may decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Avoid justifying actions or using rational arguments, as attraction is an emotional and instinctual response, not a conscious choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[effective_communication_in_dating | effective communication in dating]].

### Subcommunication and Attraction

What you communicate indirectly, or "subcommunication," is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Bragging about achievements** may seem like demonstrating high value, but it often subcommunicates insecurity and inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **"Nice Guys"** who spoil women with gifts and expensive dates may think they're showing care, but this often subcommunicates neediness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **"Bad Boys,"** despite treating women poorly, often attract them because they subcommunicate confidence, high status, emotional independence, and that they don't need to prove anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. They make the woman feel lucky to have their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

You don't need to be a "bad boy" to attract women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>; you can be kind and respectful while still being highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The key is to understand this instinct and female nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Women are emotional beings who operate based on a set of instinctual rules, and understanding these rules simplifies understanding women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Conclusion: Shifting Your Approach

If you are single or have not experienced a fulfilling relationship, it's not a personal flaw but a matter of your actions and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. By changing your behavior based on these principles, you can transform your dating success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

## The Foundation of Connection

A woman's feeling of safety is paramount for the development of love, [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | attachment]], and lasting [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | connection]] in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This emotional safety is deeper than mere physical protection; it relates to a man's character and his ability to navigate challenges, including those within the relationship itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

The importance of this safety is highlighted by the story of a friend whose wife, young and beautiful, divorced him five or six years into their marriage because she "didn't feel safe with him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His approach to their relationship was to be "too nice," never standing up to her, letting her cross boundaries, and constantly trying to help her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He believed kindness and compromise would avoid problems, but it resulted in her feeling unsafe and leaving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Historical Roots of Safety

To understand what makes women feel safe, one can look back to the era of primitive humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. In that time, a man needed to possess certain [[qualities_that_make_women_feel_safe | qualities]] for a woman and her children to feel secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. It wasn't simply about being strong or tall, as a physically strong man could still abandon his family in the face of danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Instead, women became genetically programmed to seek a man with the "ability to be dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

> [!DEFINITION] The "Ability to be Dangerous"
> This doesn't mean being a criminal or literally causing harm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. It means having the capacity to cause harm if necessary, or the ability to be strong and assertive when required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. This is why women can be attracted to "bad boys" who appear strong and show this "dangerous side" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It's a natural, genetic draw to men who can make them feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Cultivating Emotional Safety

To make a woman feel safe, a man needs to know how to show his strong and "dangerous" side, while maintaining his morals and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The key is demonstrating an ability to protect her from danger by setting boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. A woman assesses a man's character by how he interacts with her; if she can easily disrespect or manipulate him, she will conclude he is not capable of protecting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

The man who embodies the "ability to be dangerous" possesses two crucial [[qualities_that_make_women_feel_safe | qualities]]:

### 1. Fearlessness

A woman will recognize a man's fearlessness if he demonstrates that he is not afraid of *her* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. The dynamic of the relationship should resemble a strong man with a woman who craves him, not a little boy terrified of upsetting his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. A man needs to be convinced that he is in control of the relationship, and she needs to believe it too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Women often test men, and deep down, they desire a man who pushes back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. They prefer to feel intense [[Maintaining attraction and emotional engagement | attraction]] and admiration for a strong, authoritative man rather than contempt for a fearful, approval-seeking one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

A primary example of fearlessness is a man's willingness to be honest, even if it might upset her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Lying to avoid her "punishment" or because of fear of upsetting her is not acting like a real man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. If her [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotional state]] dictates your honesty, you are living for her approval rather than your principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Common Lies to Avoid
> Men often tell small lies to avoid confrontation or perceived punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
> *   "I'll be there soon" when running late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
> *   "Yes, I did it already" when forgetting a task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.
> *   "I didn't know that was today" to avoid an unwanted task <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
> *   "I'm fine, everything's okay" when in a bad mood or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
> *   "It didn't cost that much" when fearful of her disapproval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
> *   "I didn't have a signal / I missed your call" when screening calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
>
> Stop lying, don't apologize excessively, and don't fear her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The moment you fear a woman's reaction is the moment you lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. When a man tells a woman the truth, even if she gets upset, her [[Maintaining attraction and emotional engagement | attraction]] to him increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### 2. Ability to Confront

Beyond fearlessness, a man must possess the ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This means being willing to confront *her*, to face her, and express himself clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Avoid being a "yes man" who always agrees, even when something is wrong, and would rather avoid disagreeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

Women test a man to see if he will stick to his opinions and if he is honest with himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. They want to know if he can disagree with her yet still get along, and that he has his own preferences and is not afraid to express them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. This behavior earns a woman's respect, admiration, and makes her feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Confrontation in Action
> *   **Respectful Disagreement:** When a woman dislikes a movie you loved, calmly state, "Well, you're entitled to your opinion, but I still think it was a spectacular movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
> *   **Playful Confrontation:** If your dynamic allows, playfully challenge her taste: "Wow, and here I thought you had good taste. Oh well, I guess I'm the cultured one in this relationship, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
> *   **Setting Boundaries:** If she's giving you a hard time for disagreeing, make it clear: "Look, you asked for my opinion, and I gave it. If you don't like hearing the truth from me, I suggest you think twice before asking what I think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This firmly states your right to your opinion and her choice to ask for it.
> *   **Refusing to Argue:** If she insists on arguing after you've expressed your opinion, firmly but lovingly state, "I won't argue about this," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

When a man approaches a woman this way, she will internally feel his ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Over time, she will develop a unique sense of security and see him as a reliable man in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

Do not be overly nice in an attempt to avoid conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This isn't about being harsh or hateful, but about demonstrating strength out of love for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>. Women desire a strong man so they can feel safe, and this feeling of safety is one of the most important [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotions]] that fosters [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | long-term attachment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

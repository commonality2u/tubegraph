Developing effective social skills and charisma isn't about superficial techniques like constant eye contact or repeating someone's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. Instead, true connection stems from deeper qualities related to personality and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. Charisma is built upon three core elements: presence, warmth, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:51">[01:05:51]</a>. For genuine connection, these elements must be applied together, maintaining a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>.

## Cultivating Presence

Presence in social interactions means making the other person feel strong and valued, rather than attempting to showcase one's own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. This is achieved through two main aspects: active listening and personal comfort.

### Genuine Listening

[[effective_listening_skills_in_relationships | Effective listening skills]] are fundamental to presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>. This goes beyond common advice like maintaining eye contact or nodding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:07">[01:57:07]</a>. The key is to genuinely focus on what the other person is saying without simultaneously thinking about what you will say next <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>.

Instead of formulating a response while someone speaks, simply listen and care about their message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:49">[02:18:49]</a>. This authentic attention is felt by the speaker, even if not explicitly shown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:25">[02:37:25]</a>. When you truly listen, you make the speaker feel a connection and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:21">[03:01:21]</a>. This value is something people deeply seek, making them drawn to those who provide it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>.

### Being Comfortable and Spontaneous

Another crucial aspect of presence is being comfortable and at ease in any situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:24">[03:18:24]</a>. Your body language should be relaxed, signaling that you are comfortable with the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:44">[03:28:44]</a>. If you are uncomfortable, others will unconsciously sense it and may perceive that you don't want to be with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:57">[03:30:57]</a>.

To achieve this, simply be spontaneous and at ease, understanding that you have the right to be yourself as long as you don't harm anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:02">[03:40:02]</a>. For example, if you need to sneeze, do it without hesitation or embarrassment, regardless of who is around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:02">[03:59:02]</a>. When you are comfortable doing what you want, others feel closer to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:40">[04:21:40]</a>, and they will, in turn, feel more comfortable around you as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:36">[04:34:36]</a>.

In essence, presence is about relaxing to make others relax with you, and truly listening to the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:03">[04:44:03]</a>.

## The Role of Warmth in Perception

The impact of genuine listening and comfortable presence is amplified by "warmth," which encompasses kindness, gentleness, affection, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Human communication relies heavily on feelings and emotions, with only 7% dependent on words and 93% on body language and feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:03">[05:16:03]</a>.

Your inner feelings and emotions play a significant role in whether others will want to be around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:14">[05:54:14]</a>. For example, if you feel an internal dislike for someone, that energy will be felt by them, preventing a genuine connection, even if your words are neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

Therefore, when interacting, assume the other person is good and look for their positive qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>. Cultivate an inner feeling of admiration and enthusiasm for talking with them, and a genuine desire to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:02">[06:16:02]</a>. This internal feeling will unconsciously emanate from you and touch the other person's heart, fostering mutual connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:42">[06:22:42]</a>. Just as your comfort makes others comfortable, your desire to be with someone will make them want to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:22">[06:36:22]</a>.

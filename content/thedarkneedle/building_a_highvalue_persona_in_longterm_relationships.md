As a man, there are three paths when it comes to relationships with women: being the "nice guy," being the "bad boy," or being the "half bad half nice" individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The "nice guy" often ends up in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, while the "bad boy" experiences frequent breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The goal is to be the "half bad half nice" persona, which can make women fall deeply in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a> without falling into the "nice guy" trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This "half bad half nice" individual can also be referred to as a "gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Principle of Exceptions

Human brains naturally pay attention to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This applies to all social relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:

*   If you are always kind, a small mistake stands out and can lead to resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
*   Conversely, someone who is not naturally kind but does one good thing may be highly praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   You won't earn respect by always serving or being kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It's better to be a "black page that occasionally shows white spots" than a "white page that occasionally shows black spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

When applied to women, being "always nice" means your kindness is not seen as special or appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, if you behave normally or indifferently and *occasionally* do something nice, these gestures will stand out and increase attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Woman's Perception of a Gentleman

When you don't behave as "naturally nice" but rather normally or indifferently, a woman perceives you as a high-value man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Your lack of constant niceness is interpreted as [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | confidence and self-worth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When a high-value man does something nice, it becomes an exception, which she focuses on and remembers for extended periods, deepening her love and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This behavior contributes to [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintaining attraction and mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Key Principles for Building a High-Value Persona

To be a high-value man without being overly nice, while still being a gentleman, focus on two fundamental points: attention and requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

### 1. Managing Attention

It's a misconception that women love constant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For long-term, healthy, and stable relationships, you should not give attention *all the time* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. There are specific situations for giving, withholding, or remaining neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This is critical for [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | building power and maintaining autonomy in relationships]] and [[maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | maintaining leadership in relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

#### Attention Based on Emotional States

Your decision to give attention depends on the type and origin of emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:

*   **Woman feels negative emotions because of you:** Give her attention (e.g., if you made her jealous or angry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **You feel negative emotions because of her:** Do not give her attention, and do not show anger or affectation; ignore it completely (e.g., if she posts a picture with another guy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Replying normally without extra attention is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Woman feels positive emotions because of you:** Do not give too much attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. If she's happy because of attention you gave, you must stop giving it afterward to maintain balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Overdoing it devalues the attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> (e.g., after an expensive dinner, don't text her goodnight) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **You feel positive emotions because of her:** Give her attention; it is necessary (e.g., she wears an attractive outfit, does something you enjoy, or buys you a gift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Woman feels emotions *not* because of you:** Remain neutral and do not give her attention (e.g., work problems, family issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Helping excessively or always chasing her when she's down can place you in the "therapy zone" and lead to an emotionally drained dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Only listen kindly if she's your girlfriend, but avoid excessive attention or overdoing help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

By following this pattern, you will mostly remain neutral, only occasionally giving attention, which increases attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### 2. Handling Requests

There are two types of requests women make: tests of your strength/manipulability, or genuine requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This is crucial for [[strategies_for_maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | strategies for maintaining leadership in relationships]] and demonstrating a [[main_character_mindset_in_relationships | main character mindset in relationships]].

#### Direct Orders

Women often use direct orders, especially in early interactions, to see if you're accustomed to attractive women and won't immediately follow orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Refuse if inconvenient or nonsensical:** If she tells you to "go buy me something," refuse calmly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Accept on your own terms:** If the request doesn't bother you but is still a direct order (e.g., "take our picture," "give me a kiss on the cheek"), don't outright refuse or directly accept. Instead, take control by setting your own conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. For example, if asked to take a picture, respond with "okay, but I want you to give me your best silly sexy gangster face, ready, go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This subtle shift in control is vital for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

#### Indirect Expressions of Feelings

Women often express desires indirectly, by stating things they like (e.g., "I love the beach," "I love pizza") instead of directly requesting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. To avoid being a "nice guy" who immediately fulfills wishes, yet not be unpleasant, the answer is **delaying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

*   **Delay gratification:** If she mentions loving burritos, don't immediately take her for one. Instead, surprise her with one weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. This demonstrates thoughtfulness and that you listened, but also avoids appearing eager or submissive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It also makes you unpredictable, which women appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Fulfill wishes unexpectedly:** Take note of her preferences but act on them at unexpected moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. This shows strength and avoids submitting to her whims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Be kind but firm, making it clear she gets what she wants when *you* decide, not when she demands or complains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. This is a key element of [[creating_a_mysterious_persona_in_interactions | creating a mysterious persona in interactions]] and [[creating_a_perceived_deep_connection | creating a perceived deep connection]].

By applying these principles of managing attention and requests, you can be nice without losing your masculinity and effectively [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | build power and maintain autonomy in relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

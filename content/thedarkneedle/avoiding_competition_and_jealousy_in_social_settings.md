If you find yourself constantly being ignored by women, or chasing a specific girl who never acknowledges you, it's a significant problem in your life that isn't solved by financial status or looks alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many people who are "worse" off still receive attention from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>, indicating that your current situation is likely due to your behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Your behavior needs to change to solve this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Core Problem: Neediness
When you like a beautiful girl, you naturally want her to like you back, leading you to make efforts to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This effort causes you to step out of your natural self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>, adjusting your posture, speech, and overall demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Humans make an effort when they *need* something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. When you make an effort with a girl, it signals that you need her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Neediness
> [[avoiding_the_trap_of_seeking_validation_from_women | Neediness]] is the number one killer of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It's not about explicitly stating "I need you," but rather something a girl senses when she sees you making an effort just to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This neediness is the reason she starts ignoring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

To avoid being ignored, you must not be needy, which means you must stop making an effort and stay in your natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The moment a girl perceives that you've stepped out of your natural self, she will automatically begin ignoring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is why girls you don't even like might end up liking you â€“ because you are simply being yourself around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

## Strategies to Avoid Neediness and Competition

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion
Focus entirely on enjoying your time without caring about the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Be detached from the outcome and stop caring whether the girl approves of you or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

This includes:
*   **Playful Teasing:** Engaging in light, playful actions that demonstrate you're being yourself and not concerned with her judgment. For example, gently tapping her head with a plastic bottle and saying "Shh" when she jokes, or patting her head and saying "Good girl" if she does something you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. These actions show you're relaxed and natural, similar to how you'd act with a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Authentic Responses:** If she shares a minor mishap (like a bad test score or a fall), laugh and joke with her, assuming the situation is appropriate for humor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Your Comfort:** If you smoke, and she complains about the smoke, tell her you'll finish your cigarette instead of moving away. Let her move if she's uncomfortable; prioritize your comfort and routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself
Don't make special efforts in dating that deviate from your normal lifestyle:
*   **Choose Familiar Settings:** For dates, especially early ones, go to places you'd normally frequent with a friend, even if they are inexpensive or free, like parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Ideally, choose places where you are known, as this makes her feel like an addition to your existing life, rather than the reason for a complete lifestyle change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Dress Naturally:** Avoid dressing excessively or spending a long time preparing for a date. Wear something normal and simple, just as you would when meeting a sibling or friend. This shows you're relaxed and not trying hard to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Embrace Flaws:** Don't try to prove her wrong if she criticizes your ability in something. Laugh and agree, or tell her if you genuinely don't know how to do something. Don't be ashamed of your flaws or force yourself to meet her standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. If she tries to set a standard (e.g., "I like athletic guys"), don't chase it. Flip the situation into a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### 3. [[avoiding_approval_seeking_behavior | Never Compete Over Her]]
Never put yourself in a situation where you are competing for a girl's attention with other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Avoid Seeking Attention:** In social settings, some guys try to gain girls' attention by competing with jokes, showing off strength, or telling exciting stories, sometimes even being rude to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. Don't be one of these guys. Competing for a girl's approval indicates neediness, insecurity, and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Stay Natural:** If someone tells a joke or story, don't try to one-up them. Stay calm and natural, as if there were no girls present, and simply enjoy the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
*   **Elevate Others:** One of the strongest ways to impress girls is to elevate the value of other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. If someone tells a joke, laugh heartily. If someone shares a story, don't try to surpass them. If someone does something impressive, clap, laugh, and highlight their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Girls notice when a man doesn't compete and instead displays [[confidence_in_social_interactions | confidence]] and self-assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Don't Be Jealous:** If you see a girl you like with another guy, do not ask her about him or try to know the details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Introduce Her to a More Attractive Friend:** To truly shock a girl and demonstrate your high [[confidence_in_social_interactions | confidence]], introduce her to a friend who is better looking than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. When they meet, never show jealousy or fear that he might take her from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.

### 4. Body Language Reflects Comfort
Your body language should naturally reflect comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Don't overthink specific poses or gestures. Simply be comfortable. If you want to put your hands in your pockets or on your head, do it. Stretch out and lean back. The key is to be in a position that is natural and comfortable for *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Walk and move in a way that makes you feel comfortable, and her mind will pick up on your natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

By applying these behaviors, a girl will perceive that you are someone who doesn't need her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. You will never be ignored again because you didn't put in any effort or chase her in the first place, thus never giving her the chance to ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

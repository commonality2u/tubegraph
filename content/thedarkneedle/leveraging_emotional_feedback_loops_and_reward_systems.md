To achieve desired outcomes with women, the core principle is to induce an [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional state]] where she *wants* to do what you desire, rather than acting out of fear, obligation, or financial interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. This means her behavior must stem from emotions, not logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

## Understanding a Woman's Emotional Landscape

A common pitfall for men is to project their logical understanding onto women's minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. The speaker asserts that "women don't understand this. Women are stupid. A woman's behavior comes from her emotions, not from her logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Unlike men, who might instinctively reciprocate favors based on logic (e.g., paying for lunch next time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>, women's actions are primarily driven by emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

The key to influencing a woman's behavior lies in understanding and controlling her [[emotional_debt_loop_strategy | emotional feedback loop]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:00">[06:39:00]</a>, which controls 90% of her behavior with a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This control is exerted through a system of reward and punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

## Prerequisites for Application

Before applying the reward and punishment strategy, two crucial elements must be in place:

### Intention
Having a clear intention is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>. Many men engage with women without a defined outcome, like being "lost at sea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
It's vital to:
*   **Define your desired outcome** from the very beginning of an interaction (e.g., getting a phone number, setting a date, aiming for a physical encounter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Lead the conversation** based on your intention, rather than waiting for women to give signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Women will not explicitly tell you when to flirt or ask personal questions; these are a man's responsibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid self-validation**: Don't talk to women just to feel better about yourself without a clear objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.
*   **Persist until a clear "no"**: Once you have a goal, move toward it until you receive an undeniable refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Do not make decisions for her, assuming she won't want something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Show clear intentions**: [[instinctive_human_desire_for_value_and_appreciation | Women are attracted to men who are direct and upfront with their intentions]], without social restraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.
*   **Commit 100%**: Make a firm decision to pursue your goal fully, rather than half-heartedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### Attention
Your attention serves as a form of currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. When attention is too readily available, it loses its value, leading to a lack of respect and effort from the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Avoid being constantly available or overly responsive, as this makes your attention seem cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## The Strategy: Reward and Punishment

The fundamental principle is to reinforce behaviors you desire and discourage those you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. While women often instinctively apply this by rewarding confidence and punishing neediness, men typically fail to reciprocate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. It's crucial to remember that women don't inherently know what you like or dislike; you must communicate it clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>.

### Rewarding Positive Behavior
[[strategies_for_rewarding_positive_behavior_and_addressing_negative_behavior | Rewarding good behavior]] strengthens it and spreads positive emotions, fostering a deeper [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | emotional engagement]] and loyalty in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. This makes a woman feel valued and invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

Instead of only making small comments or none at all when a woman does something sweet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>, you should:
*   **Provide more attention**: Lean in, open your body language, focus your gaze, especially when she says something interesting or positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>.
*   **Offer compliments**: Highlight specific qualities or traits you like, even if they appear occasionally, to encourage their recurrence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. For example, if she becomes more attentive, you could say, "I really like how focused you are now; it's refreshing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Delaying the compliment slightly prevents appearing immediately reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **Use physical touch**: When she does something pleasing (e.g., a funny comment, buying a drink), take the opportunity to touch her while thanking her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. This communicates appreciation and that your touch is a positive reinforcement for her good behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Addressing Negative Behavior (Punishment)
[[strategies_for_rewarding_positive_behavior_and_addressing_negative_behavior | Punishment]] aims to weaken undesired behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. It is crucial that punishment:
*   **Does not appear upset or emotional**: You should not seem emotionally affected by her negative behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>, unless the behavior is truly severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
*   **Is subtle, not exaggerated**: Big, dramatic reactions (e.g., turning your back) can be perceived as childish or entertaining, rather than a genuine threat of disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. As you become more socially skilled, aim for increased subtlety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.
*   **Sends a clear message**: You want to convey that you don't have time for unproductive behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

Common mistakes men make include rushing to address complaints or pouting, which teaches women that negative behavior gets them what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Never react based on her negative behavior; give her what she wants because *you* choose to, not because she complained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

Methods of punishment include:
*   **Withdrawing attention**: If a woman starts behaving negatively (e.g., rude jokes, implying you're not good enough, talking about other men), show boredom by reducing your attention, letting your gaze drift, leaning back, and letting your interest fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   **Displaying indifference and changing the topic (Steamrolling)**: If she says something you don't like, it's acceptable to be indifferent and pivot the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:59:00">[11:59:00]</a>. For example, if she mentions her ex and then states, "all men are pigs," you can redirect by saying, "Only the ones who live in barns. Anyway, what happened after you found out your ex had another girlfriend?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a> This technique overrides negative direction to bring the conversation back to productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.

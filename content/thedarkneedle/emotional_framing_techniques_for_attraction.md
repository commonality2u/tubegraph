This article outlines a three-step plan designed to initiate and develop attraction, ultimately leading to a woman "chasing" and accepting an emotional frame set by the man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The techniques focus on leveraging [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | emotional dynamics]] and ambiguity rather than traditional courtship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

### Step 1: Make Her Surrender to Your Emotional Frame ("You're Trouble")

The first step aims to shift the power dynamic by making a woman surrender to the man's [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional frame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This is achieved through a technique called "You're Trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Most men approach women with a subconscious goal of being liked, appearing safe, friendly, or attractive, which women are accustomed to and use to their advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. They expect to control the interaction's emotional tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

By saying "You're Trouble," delivered calmly and confidently, the man is not seeking approval but subtly implying the woman is dangerous, putting her on the defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This removes the "I hope she likes me" energy and replaces it with the expectation that she must prove she's not "chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Women are said to crave men who "see through them" and who challenge their typical patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This technique disarms her by signaling, "I see your game and I'm not playing it," forcing her to recalibrate and react to the man rather than operating on social autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

#### Using Ambiguity

The phrase "You're Trouble" is open-ended, not defining what kind of trouble she might be (seductive, toxic, playful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This ambiguity creates a "psychological itch" as her brain attempts to fill in the blanks, making her want to understand how the man perceives her and regain control of the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

If she starts defending herself or trying to shape his perception, she has already lost control of the frame and is now "chasing" his approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Her attention becomes locked on his opinion of her, placing her within his [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional frame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

#### Application of "You're Trouble"

The technique is applied in two stages:

*   **Stage 1: Early Introduction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
    *   Deliver within the first 5 to 10 minutes of conversation, before she can establish a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
    *   Use when she flirts too easily, smiles excessively, asks too many questions, or acts performatively innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
    *   Deliver with a calm look and a smirk, then remain silent; do not laugh, explain, or soften the statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
    *   Can also be used as a "pattern break" instead of a compliment, such as in response to a cute photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This forces her to adjust in real-time, revealing her authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

    *   **Potential Reactions:**
        *   If she pushes back ("No, I'm not"), she's defending her image, indicating that the words have resonated emotionally. This represents [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | emotional investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
        *   If she plays along ("Maybe I am"), she accepts a new identity that will shape her behavior around the man, allowing him to control the [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | emotional rhythm]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

*   **Stage 2: Reusing the Phrase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>
    *   Repeat the phrase later when she reveals her "real nature" or says something "unhinged" or "revealing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   Deliver quietly and calmly, without a big reaction, to establish it as a recognized pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   After the second use, she may begin calling herself "trouble," internalizing the label and emotionally surrendering to the man's frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Step 2: Keep the Chase Going ("I Like This, Whatever This Is")

This step aims to create "craving" and sustain the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The technique, "I like this, whatever this is," is used when the woman begins to open up, lean in, or show her unique qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

The phrase rewards her emotionally by acknowledging a connection ("I like this"), but maintains ambiguity by refusing to define it ("whatever this is") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. This mix of warmth and confusion creates an [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional cocktail]] that can lead to obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Her brain gets stuck in a loop, questioning the nature of the relationship, which becomes an "addiction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This provides [[emotional_versus_logical_decision_making_in_attraction | emotional weight]] without structural commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

#### Application of "I Like This, Whatever This Is"

*   **Timing:** The phrase must be earned, used when [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | emotional tension]] is built up enough to be charged but not yet romantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Context:** Deliver in a moment of natural intimacy, such as after shared laughter or when she is opening up and being vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Delivery:** Say it casually, as if it just "slipped out," then immediately look away or change the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The goal is to make her *feel* something without giving her [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | emotional closure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The man's energy should convey "Yeah, I felt something, but I'm not going to make a big deal out of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. This subtle detachment makes the line powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** She may not respond directly but will replay the moment later, turning the simple sentence into a "mind virus" that causes her to watch the man differently and think of them as "something undefined but real" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. The uncertainty makes her seek resolution from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Step 3: Turn Confusion into Ownership ("You Already Act Like My Girl Sometimes")

The final step aims to convert the emotional confusion into a sense of ownership, moving towards a "girlfriend" role without explicitly asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

By stating, "You already act like my girl sometimes," the man assigns her the role partially, creating tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This implies she is behaving like someone emotionally attached without the official title, exposing behavior she might not have intended to admit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Her mind races, questioning her behavior and their relationship status, leading to a "mild [[emotional_versus_logical_decision_making_in_attraction | emotional spiral]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

*   If she pushes back, it creates internal tension as she fights her own perceived truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   If she agrees, even jokingly, she confirms her attachment and steps directly into the man's frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

The man isn't asking her to be his girlfriend or stating a desire for it; he is merely observing her current behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This prompts her to scan her past actions and potentially play further into the role (e.g., being more nurturing, jealous, consistent), believing she is simply being herself, while unknowingly being influenced by the man's framing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. The man is "installing the behavior by telling her she's already doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

#### Application of "You Already Act Like My Girl Sometimes"

*   **Timing:** Delivered after she exhibits some form of [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | emotional behavior]] that resembles "girlfriend behavior" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Delivery:** Non-serious, like a calm observation with a slight, playful smirk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The statement should land heavily despite not being meant to be deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Example contexts:** If she gets annoyed at him for not replying, or performs a nurturing/domestic act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Tone:** Never needy or an attempt to get her to be a girlfriend, but rather a tease that contains an undeniable truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Once she starts defending, joking, or playing into it, the frame has landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. She begins thinking about her role in his life and may start using terms like "we" or "already," indicating she has accepted the label in her mind and is waiting for the man to formalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

By using all three phrases correctly, the man creates an [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional loop]] that leads a woman to "call herself yours" without being chased or explicitly asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. The first phrase creates tension, the second builds a bond, and the third gives her the illusion of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

The speaker's personal journey highlights a shift from conventional social skills advice to a deeper understanding rooted in psychology and human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Traditional advice like making eye contact or repeating names is deemed superficial and unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Instead, the focus shifts to internal personality and behavior as the true source of [[understanding_charisma | charisma]] and likeability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Elements of Charisma

[[understanding_charisma | Charisma]] is composed of three core elements: presence, warmth, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. These elements must be applied together, as disrupting their balance can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Presence

Presence involves making others feel strong, rather than demonstrating your own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

*   **Active Listening**: Focus on what the other person is saying without thinking about your response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This genuine listening gives value to the speaker, which is highly sought after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Comfort and Spontaneity**: Be comfortable and relaxed in your demeanor, allowing your body language to reflect this ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This means being spontaneous and not suppressing natural actions like sneezing out of shyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Your comfort makes others feel more at ease around you, fostering a closer connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This also relates to [[adjusting_mood_and_posture_to_influence_others | adjusting mood and posture to influence others]].

### Warmth

Warmth refers to kindness, gentleness, affection, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, it's crucial to understand that being kind doesn't mean constant praise or doing whatever others ask, as this can be perceived as hypocrisy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This touches on [[understanding_the_balance_between_being_nice_and_bad | understanding the balance between being nice and bad]].

*   **Genuine Feeling**: Communication is largely non-verbal (93% through body language, feelings, and emotions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Your inner feelings and emotions, like admiration or enthusiasm, are sensed by others and dictate their comfort and desire to be around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Assume others are good people when first meeting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Power of Giving**: Add value to others' lives by offering advice or sharing information, but do not impose it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Give freely without expecting follow-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Acceptance, Understanding, and Honesty**: Be honest about your preferences, even if they differ from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Accept others as they are without negativity or judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Sincere praise is encouraged, as is honest feedback, but briefly and without insistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Power

Power provides the inner strength necessary for charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Without it, presence and warmth alone are insufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This element is crucial for [[increasing_social_power_through_interactions | increasing social power through interactions]] and [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | building power and maintaining autonomy in relationships]].

*   **Avoid Seeking Approval**: Do not talk about yourself excessively or seek others' approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Confrontation and Boundaries**: Do not be afraid to confront people or uphold your principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If someone attempts to cross your "red lines," stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Clearly state what you want or object to, such as addressing a problem in a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Strong Body Language**: Mental and internal strength is reflected in body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. If you cannot feel this strength, adopt strong body language, which will then influence you psychologically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This includes being comfortable, not worrying, and allowing natural movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Imagine yourself as the strongest person in the room and act accordingly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. This aligns with [[adjusting_mood_and_posture_to_influence_others | adjusting mood and posture to influence others]].

The benefits of charisma extend beyond mere likeability, aiding in work efficiency, career advancement, and overall life success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

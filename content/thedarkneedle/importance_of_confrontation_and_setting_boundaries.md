For a woman to feel safe and connected in a relationship, it is essential for her to perceive her partner as strong and capable of protecting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. This sense of security is vital for love, attachment, and long-term connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## The Need for Perceived "Dangerousness"

Historically, in the era of primitive humans, women sought men who possessed qualities that made them feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. While physical strength might seem obvious, true safety came from a man's willingness to stand his ground and fight for his family, even if physically weaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This led to women becoming genetically programmed to seek a man with the "ability to be dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This doesn't mean being a criminal or a "bad boy" in the literal sense, but rather possessing the capacity to cause harm if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. Women are often attracted to individuals who appear strong and display this dangerous side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### The Pitfall of Being "Too Nice"

A common mistake men make is being "too nice," believing that kindness and compromise will avoid problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. However, this approach can lead to a woman feeling unsafe because the man never stands up for himself, allows her to cross boundaries, and constantly tries to help her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Such behavior, while seemingly positive, can lead to a lack of respect and, ultimately, a woman feeling unsafe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

## How to Project Strength and "Dangerousness"

To make a woman feel safe, a man needs to know how to show his strong and "dangerous" side by adopting traits that attract women while maintaining his morals and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. The right way to demonstrate protective capability is by showing the ability to [[setting_boundaries_in_relationships | set boundaries]] when necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. A woman gauges a man's character by how he interacts with her; if she can easily disrespect or manipulate him, she will conclude he is incapable of protecting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### 1. Fearlessness

A man with the "ability to be dangerous" must not be afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. A woman can discern this by observing if he is afraid of *her* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

*   **Avoid Child-like Behavior:** A man's behavior and conversations should resemble a relationship between a strong man and a woman who craves him, not a little boy terrified of upsetting his mom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. If a man behaves like a child, the woman may reluctantly take on a maternal role, which is not attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Don't Lie to Avoid Punishment:** A significant indicator of fear is a man's willingness to lie to his partner to avoid her punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. If a woman's emotional state dictates his honesty, he is living for her approval rather than by his own principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   **Common Lies and Truthful Responses:**
        *   "I'll be there soon." (When running late) -> "I'm running late." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>
        *   "Yes, I did it already. I'm finishing up now." (When forgotten) -> "No, I didn't. Thanks for the reminder. I'll get to it after [specific time]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
        *   "I didn't know that was today." (When avoiding a task) -> If you don't want to do something, say so directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
        *   "I'm fine, everything's okay." (When upset) -> Be honest about needing space or how you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
        *   "It didn't cost that much." (When afraid of disapproval) -> Be honest, or if it's not her concern, state that playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
        *   "I didn't have a signal/my phone was off/I missed your call." (When screening calls) -> If you're busy, confidently state that you're occupied and will call back later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Consequences of Dishonesty:** Telling small lies to avoid confrontation or perceived punishment is a bad habit that prioritizes comfort over long-term relationship health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Be Truthful:** Stop lying, avoid excessive apologies, and do not fear her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The moment a man fears a woman's reaction, he begins to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. When a man tells the truth, even if it upsets her, her attraction to him actually increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Recognizing that the pressure to lie comes from fear allows a man to act fearlessly, leading to deeper connections with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### 2. Ability to Confront

Beyond fearlessness, a man must possess the ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This means being willing to confront her directly, face her, and express himself clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

*   **Avoid Being a "Yes Man":** Do not be a man who always agrees with his woman, regardless of whether she is right or wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. A woman tests a man to see if he will stick to his opinions, if he is honest with himself, and if he can disagree with her while still getting along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. She wants to see that he has his own preferences and is not afraid to express them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. This behavior earns her respect and admiration, making her feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

*   **Examples of Confrontation:**
    *   **Respectful Disagreement:** "Well, you're entitled to your opinion, but I still think it was a spectacular movie." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>
    *   **Playful Disagreement (if appropriate for the relationship):** "Wow, and here I thought you had good taste. Oh well, I guess I'm the cultured one in this relationship, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
    *   **[[setting_boundaries_in_relationships | Setting Boundaries]] for Opinions:** If she habitually gives you a hard time for disagreeing, make it clear that you're entitled to your opinion and not interested in justifying your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. For example: "Look, you asked for my opinion, and I gave it. If you don't like hearing the truth from me, I suggest you think twice before asking what I think." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a> This demonstrates [[being_assertive_and_setting_boundaries | being assertive and setting boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   **Refusing to Argue:** If you've stated your convictions and she insists on arguing, firmly and lovingly say, "I won't argue about this," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>. Don't be afraid to express your opinion just because she might try to impose hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

By approaching her this way, a woman will feel internally that you have the ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Over time, this will lead to a unique sense of security and a perception of you as a man she can rely on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. This is done out of love, not hatred, as women desire strength so they can feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The feeling of safety is paramount for long-term attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

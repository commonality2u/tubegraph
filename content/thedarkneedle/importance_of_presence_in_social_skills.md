The journey to effective [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] often begins with misconceptions. Initially, advice found in books like "How to Win Friends and Influence People" or videos about [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] may not be effective, as they focus on superficial actions such as making eye contact or constantly repeating a person's name <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The true solution lies in one's [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | personality and behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Being charismatic and well-liked is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, and it hinges on three core elements: presence, warmth, and power, all of which must be applied together in balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## The Element of Presence

Presence is the first crucial component of charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. It's not about showcasing your own strength, but rather about making the other person feel strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This concept is illustrated by a 1886 UK election anecdote where a journalist described one candidate making her feel he was the strongest, while the winning candidate made her feel *she* was the strongest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This demonstrates that true charismatic presence elevates those around you.

### Be a Good Listener

A key aspect of presence is being a good listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. When someone is speaking, the focus should be entirely on what they are saying, not on formulating your next response or thinking about superficial actions like maintaining eye contact or nodding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The biggest mistake people make is thinking about what to say instead of genuinely listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

By simply listening and truly caring about what the other person is saying, your response will come naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This genuine act of listening is rare and highly valued; it makes the speaker feel a profound connection, leading them to talk to you more than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. When you listen, you give value to the speaker, which is something people actively seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Be Comfortable

The second aspect of presence is being comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This principle applies in all social situations, whether sitting among people, alone, or engaging in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Your [[body_language_and_comfort_in_social_situations | body language]] and overall demeanor should be relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

Others unconsciously sense your comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. If you appear uncomfortable, it conveys the impression that you don't wish to be with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. To be comfortable means to be at ease and spontaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This involves accepting the right to be yourself, as long as you don't harm anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For example, if you feel a sneeze coming, just sneeze without hesitation, regardless of who is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Being comfortable and doing what you want, without concern for others' judgments, is a hallmark of charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This genuine comfort makes those around you feel closer and more relaxed in your presence, encouraging them to be comfortable themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This also contributes to [[body_language_and_comfort_in_social_situations | strong body language]] and [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | inner strength]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. The key is to relax, which in turn helps others relax with you, coupled with truly listening to the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

[[Push-pull flirting techniques]] involve a playful combination of pushing a woman away and pulling her back in, both physically and verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This dynamic aims to create intrigue and excitement, making the woman more invested in the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## How Push-Pull Flirting Works
The core idea is to introduce a contradiction where you express attraction while simultaneously creating distance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. This keeps her on her toes and prevents the interaction from becoming too predictable.

## Examples
*   **"You're too cute for me to handle."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>
    *   This pulls her in by stating she is cute, but pushes her away by implying she's *too* much to handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **"You're awesome, you're like my little sister."** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>
    *   This pulls her in with a compliment ("awesome") but immediately pushes her away by comparing her to a little sister, which is not a romantic comparison <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This creates a playful tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

## Benefits of Push-Pull Flirting
*   **Creates Intrigue and Excitement:** The "back and forth" nature of push-pull flirting keeps the woman guessing and makes the interaction more engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Demonstrates High Value:** When a woman is too easily obtained, her perceived value can decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Push-pull flirting subtly communicates that you are not easily won over, thereby presenting yourself as a higher-value individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   This is why women might lose interest in "nice guys" who constantly fawn over them, but are drawn to those who "play hard to get" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. As Thomas Paine noted, "What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Context and Further Learning
This technique is part of a broader understanding of how to [[techniques_for_deep_connection_with_women | attract women]] and influence their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. It's important to apply this within a comprehensive understanding of [[how women think | female psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, as using only this technique in isolation can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

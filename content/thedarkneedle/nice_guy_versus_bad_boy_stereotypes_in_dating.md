In the realm of dating, men often categorize themselves or are categorized into different types. According to one perspective, a man has three fundamental choices when it comes to women: the nice guy, the bad boy, or the "half bad half nice" individual, referred to as the gentleman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | Understanding these dynamics]] can significantly impact one's success in relationships.

## The Nice Guy
The "nice guy" is characterized by constant kindness and a desire to please <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. However, this approach often leads to failure with women, with the furthest outcome being the [[understanding_the_difference_between_boyfriend_and_friend_categories | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

### Misconceptions About Niceness
A key [[misconceptions_about_niceness_in_relationships | misconception]] is that perpetual kindness will be appreciated or seen as special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Human psychology suggests that the brain naturally pays attention to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. If a man is always kind ("white" background), any minor mistake or refusal ("black dot") will stand out disproportionately, making him seem like a bad person and eroding respect for all the good deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. Therefore, consistently serving or being kind does not earn people's respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## The Bad Boy
The "bad boy" archetype is known for making women chase him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While this can attract women, it often results in a life filled with frequent breakups and new relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The bad boy typically does not care about a woman's desires, acting purely on his own preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## The Half Bad Half Nice (The Gentleman)
The ideal approach, described as "half bad half nice" or the gentleman, aims to make women fall deeply in love and think about the man constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This approach involves behaving normally or even indifferently most of the time, punctuated by occasional acts of kindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### Why This Approach Works
*   **Perception of Value:** When a man is not constantly "nice" but instead behaves normally or indifferently, a woman perceives him as a high-value individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>. This is because a lack of persistent niceness is interpreted as confidence and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of Kindness:** When a high-value man performs a kind act, it stands out as an exception and is remembered for days, weeks, or even a lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. This selective kindness increases attraction and love over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This is likened to being a "black page" with occasional "white spots," rather than a "white page" with occasional "black spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Practical Application for the Gentleman

To be a high-value man without being overly nice, two fundamental points are crucial:

#### 1. Attention
The notion that women love constant attention is a [[misconceptions_about_niceness_in_relationships | misconception]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. While withholding all attention can work for short-term or purely physical relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>, long-term healthy relationships require a balanced approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>.

Attention should be given or withheld based on the type and origin of emotions experienced in the relationship:

*   **Woman feels negative emotions because of you:** If you are the cause of her negative emotions (e.g., jealousy from talking to another woman, anger due to a mistake you made), you should give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>.
*   **You feel negative emotions because of her:** If she causes your negative emotions (e.g., talking to another man, posting a picture you dislike), you must *not* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Do not show anger or effect, but ignore the situation completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. If she texts, reply normally without extra attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Woman feels positive emotions because of you:** If she is happy because of something you did, do not give her too much continued attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>. Attention should not be continuous; there must be a balance between attention and lack of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. For example, if you take her on an expensive date, do not text her afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **You feel positive emotions because of her:** If she does something that makes you happy (e.g., wears an attractive outfit, buys you a gift), you *should* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   **Woman feels emotions *not* because of you:** If her emotions (positive or negative) are unrelated to you (e.g., work problems, family issues), you should remain neutral and not give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Giving attention in these situations can place you in the "therapy zone," leading her to rely on you excessively for emotional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

By following this pattern, most of the time you will remain neutral, with attention given only occasionally, leading to increased attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:04]</a>.

#### 2. Requests
When a woman makes requests, a man must discern if it's a test of his strength or a genuine desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.

*   **Direct Orders/Tests:** If a request comes as a direct order (e.g., "Hold this for me," "Take her picture") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>, especially in early interactions, it's often a test to see if you're easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>.
    *   **Refuse:** If the request is inconvenient or makes no sense (e.g., "Go buy me something"), you must refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.
    *   **Accept on Your Terms:** If the request doesn't bother you but is a direct order (e.g., "Give me a kiss," "Take our picture"), do not accept directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Instead, accept on your own terms, taking control and setting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. This subtly shifts the power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.

*   **Indirect Expressions of Feelings:** Women often express desires indirectly, saying "I love the beach" instead of "I want to go to the beach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. To avoid being a "nice guy" who immediately fulfills every wish, the key is **delaying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
    *   Take note of her preferences, but do not act on them immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>.
    *   Surprise her with the desired item or experience weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
    *   This shows thoughtfulness without appearing overly eager or submissive, and makes you unpredictable, which women appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>.
    *   By being kind but firm and not submitting to whims, she learns she gets what she wants when you decide, not when she demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.

By mastering these principles of attention and requests, a man can be perceived as kind without losing his masculinity, thus avoiding the pitfalls of both the nice guy and bad boy stereotypes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

To [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | build emotional connections]] and make someone miss you, one effective technique is to evoke emotions related to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. This method is particularly useful when ending a conversation or date to leave a lasting impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Utilizing Past Experiences for Connection

Experiences are deeply tied to emotions, whether they stem from childhood, travel, or significant life changes like quitting a job for a new career path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Talking about these experiences can lead to amazing stories filled with strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Engaging with Her Experiences

To prompt discussion about her past experiences, you can ask questions such as:
*   "What made you move to this city?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   "What's the biggest adventure you've been on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   "What's the most exciting place you've visited?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

### Deepening the [[Creating Emotional Attachment Through Conversation | Emotional Connection]]

Diving into the emotions behind these experiences offers unique opportunities to [[creating_a_perceived_deep_connection | connect on a deeper level]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Follow up with questions that focus on feelings, not just facts:
*   "How did it feel when you did [X]?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   "What was your feeling during that moment?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>

### Relating Through Shared Emotions

It is not necessary to have had the exact same experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. What matters is the emotion connected to those experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Once she opens up about how she felt, you can relate by sharing different experiences you've had that triggered similar emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

For example, if she expresses anxiety about quitting a corporate job to become a tourist guide, you can relate by sharing an experience where you felt similar emotions, such as moving to a new country, starting a business, or taking a major risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This allows you to [[creating_positive_emotional_connections_through_dialogue | connect with her on an emotional level]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

### Maintaining Focus

When relating your own experiences, keep your contribution brief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Quickly shift the focus back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This demonstrates that you truly [[understanding_emotional_states_and_responses | understand her]] and are genuinely interested in her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This approach makes her feel listened to and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

By discussing past experiences that triggered strong emotions, you can [[triggering_emotional_responses_during_conversations | stimulate deep emotional feelings]] and make her think about you after the conversation, giving her a reason to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

The concept of "chasing" in relationships is often misunderstood, but it's crucial to recognize that there are two distinct types: logical chasing and emotional chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Logical Chasing

Logical chasing occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear benefit she perceives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Her interest is driven by logic, such as a man's wealth or high status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. For instance, if a man is rich and holds a high status, a woman might think that entering a relationship with him would provide financial benefits, gifts, and a comfortable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. She chases him because it aligns with her interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

However, logical chasing presents two major problems:
1.  **Rarity and Difficulty** This type of chasing is extremely rare and difficult to achieve for most people, as 99% of individuals do not possess high wealth or status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Meaningful Connection** A relationship based on logical chasing will not lead to a strong, meaningful connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While a woman might appear excited by a man's financial success, her interest is in the money, not in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. She might stay, but she will always be looking for someone who can fulfill her core [[emotional_baggage_in_relationships | emotional needs]] that money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This approach is only viable if one intends to be a "sugar daddy" with abundant money to spare; otherwise, it can lead to significant financial drain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. For a woman to truly love and chase a man for who he is, logical chasing is not in one's best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Emotional Chasing

[[the_role_of_logic_versus_emotion_in_attraction | Emotional chasing]] occurs when a woman pursues a man due to her genuine feelings and love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions become beyond her control; she finds it difficult to be away from him or spend time without him and is willing to do anything for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This type of chasing fosters love, enjoyment, and contributes to the longevity of the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A golden rule is that a woman will never truly love or develop deep feelings for a man unless this type of emotional chasing takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## How to Create Emotional Chasing: The Hunting and Chasing Stages

Creating emotional chasing involves two main stages in a relationship: the hunting stage and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

An analogy to understand this dynamic is like offering someone cigarettes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Initially, you offer them freely (hunting phase), and they enjoy them. Over time, they start to crave them and seek them out themselves (chasing phase). Eventually, they become addicted and are willing to "pay" for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. In romantic relationships, this translates to giving a woman attention, then pulling back, causing her to crave and eventually seek that attention, with her "currency" being sex, though this process occurs subconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### The Hunting Phase

This initial phase is all about the man taking initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As a man, your role in dating is to choose the girl you want, which means you need to take the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

*   **Initiating Contact** When you first meet a girl, you should initiate the conversation, take the first step, and ask her out on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Asking for a Date Without Chasing** While you are taking the initiative, you must not chase her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This is reflected in how you ask for a date.
    *   **Avoid Follower Questions** Do not ask questions that put her in charge or require her decision before you can act, such as "When can I see you?" or "When are you free?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. These signal that you will follow her lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   **Use Hunter Statements** Instead, turn questions into statements that convey your intention and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, instead of "What do you like to do for fun?", say "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever; you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This confidence in leading makes her feel more comfortable following <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Handling Date Rejection** If you ask a girl out and she declines with an excuse (e.g., "I have to meet a friend on Sunday"), do not suggest another day immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Simply respond with "All right, no problem. Let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Communication After Meeting**
    *   After meeting or a date, do not send her messages or try to talk to her immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Take a step back, and after about a week, send her a message to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Stick to initiating contact once a week to propose a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
    *   If she messages you during the week, it's fine to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Continue this system until she starts messaging you daily and consistently engaging with you, which indicates she is starting to like you and has developed feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### During the Date

The primary goal during a date is to increase the interaction's energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **Punctuality**
    *   Do not wait more than 10 minutes if a girl is late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Leaving shows her you have other important things to do and prevents her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   It's better to be on time rather than purposefully showing up late to make her wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>, as women today are perceptive and will notice such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Conversation** Every topic and question should have an [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Avoid generic, boring questions like "What do you do for work?" or "How was your day?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
    *   Aim to connect on an [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotional level]] by asking questions that [[creating_mixed_emotions_in_a_relationship | emotionally resonate]] with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   Examples include: "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?" or "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The key is to trigger her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Kiss Test** When the conversation reaches a high level of [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotional involvement]], perform a kiss test to gauge if she's ready for a kiss, as an emotionally charged woman is less likely to refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Ending the Date** End the date successfully by ensuring you don't spend so much time that it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The perfect moment to end it is when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having a great time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The final step is to leave without promising another date, which helps maintain mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

### The Chasing Phase

This phase begins when the girl starts messaging you daily, calling you daily, and wanting to meet you every day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. At this point, she has transitioned into the chasing phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

*   **Don't Always Be Available** When she starts chasing you, you should not always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. For example, don't always answer her calls, and sometimes tell her you're busy when she asks to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Being constantly available will lead to her getting bored and her feelings cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. To [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | maintain attraction]] and a long-lasting relationship, she needs to chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Timing is Key** This distancing tactic should *only* be used when she has already developed feelings and is messaging you daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. If you distance yourself too early, before she has feelings, she will lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This type of distancing is effective only once she is attached to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Not Manipulation** Distancing is not manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. It reflects what a woman desires: a challenge, a strong man who challenges her, and drama in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. A woman does not want a man who is overly nice and constantly follows her lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Her Distancing Test** If she distances herself to see if you will chase her, remain calm and do not pursue her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

Always remember: Be the hunter, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

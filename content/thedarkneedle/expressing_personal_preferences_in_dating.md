A core principle in [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | dating dynamics]] suggests that if a man can make a woman strive to gain his approval, she becomes invested in him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This concept is presented as the "key to every girl's heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The instinct for women to seek approval is deeply rooted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, making it an inherent trait that can be leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## The Approval Dynamic

[[Understanding the dynamics of dating | Relationships are governed by emotion]] rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. In emotional relationships, one party often strives to gain the other's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. The goal is to position oneself so that the woman is the one seeking the man's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Mindset Shifts

A crucial first step is to avoid trying to impress the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. One of the most attractive traits in a man is not being overly concerned with gaining a woman's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Modern society may program men to feel that women are "better" and their approval must be earned, leading to subconscious behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Overcoming Internal Pressure
When talking to an attractive woman, men often feel an internal pressure to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
To counteract this:
*   **Acknowledge the pressure**: Be aware of the internal feeling that pushes you to gain her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Redirect the pressure**: Instead of trying to impress her directly, tell yourself: "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This shifts your mindset, and over time, the process becomes automatic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   **Create space**: By not trying to gain her approval, you create the space for her to want to gain yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## The Recipe: Validation and Preferences

The method to make a woman strive for your approval involves two key "ingredients":
1.  **Not giving her validation immediately**: Women naturally crave admiration and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For her to *want* to earn your validation, you must not give it to her easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This means not liking every social media post, not commenting on everything, and not appearing obsessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
2.  **Telling her what you like**: Simultaneously, you need to articulate your preferences for a girl's personality and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

When these two points are combined:
*   She notices your lack of immediate validation, triggering her instinct to seek approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   She then considers your stated preferences and begins to act on them to earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   This automatically puts her in a state of actively trying to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Conditions for Expressing Preferences

Several rules govern how you express your preferences:

#### 1. Partial Alignment
When stating your likes (e.g., preference for dresses over pants, or introverted vs. social girls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>:
*   **40% presence, 60% absence**: A small portion (around 40%) of what you like should already be present in her, but the majority (60%) should not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.
*   **Avoid insincerity**: This prevents you from appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **The contrast**: An attractive girl often receives validation for anything she does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. By withholding validation for her current actions and expressing a preference for something else, you stand out. If she then adopts that preference, you become the influencer, making her strive for your unique admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

#### 2. General Opinion, Not Demands
When stating your preferences:
*   **Speak generally**: Your words should reflect only your opinion, nothing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **No direct requests**: Do not suggest she change for you (e.g., "you should cut your hair" or "wear green") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Avoid transactional implication**: Do not convey that you're telling her what you like so she can do it to earn your approval and become your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.
*   **Casual delivery**: Talk casually and avoid directing your words specifically at her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. She will automatically apply it to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

#### 3. No Unwarranted Reactions
*   **Don't react just because she's present**: Avoid reacting to anything she says or does simply because *she* did it, especially if it's not genuinely impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **Maintain composure**: If she says something dull or silly, do not laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While she might feel uncomfortable, this discomfort can contribute to her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Reward genuine quality**: Only react (e.g., laugh) if what she says is genuinely good or remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Convey high standards**: This shows her that you are not easily impressed and that your admiration requires genuine qualities in her personality or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. [[Setting boundaries and maintaining standards in dating | Always convey that your admiration requires her to have unique and exceptional qualities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

#### 4. Approach with Curiosity, Not Admiration
When asking questions to get to know her:
*   **Curiosity as intention**: Your questions should stem from a place of curiosity, as if you haven't yet decided whether you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Reflect in body language**: Your body language and tone should reflect this genuine curiosity, not an overly eager or admiring demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Internal shift**: Focus on changing your internal intention when asking questions; this will automatically manifest in your behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

::: danger
Never allow a girl to interrogate you, especially early in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. If she repeatedly questions you while you explain yourself, she takes control and judges you, which goes against natural [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | dating dynamics]] where the man is the chooser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Avoid this by:
*   Saying "It's a long story" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   Suggesting "Take a guess" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.
*   Giving a short answer and then shifting the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

#### 5. Downplaying Shared Similarities
When she tries to impress you by highlighting commonalities or superior traits (e.g., "I practice Taekwondo," "I got excellent grades") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>:
*   **Resist the urge to reciprocate**: Your internal pressure might instinctively push you to share your similar achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
*   **Withhold the opportunity**: If you do, you don't give her the opportunity to try to win your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Casual comment or self-deprecation**: Either comment casually on what she said, or, ideally, make it seem like you're not good at the thing she's trying to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. For example, if she mentions Taekwondo, you could say, "I tried it once and almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
*   **Create space for her to impress**: This approach allows her to try to impress you, showcasing her smarts and capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

By combining these strategies, you can foster a strong desire in a woman to win your approval, placing her in a state where she actively seeks to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

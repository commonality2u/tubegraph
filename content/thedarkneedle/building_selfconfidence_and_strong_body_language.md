Developing [[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | charisma]] and being liked by others is a straightforward process, contrary to popular belief that it involves superficial techniques like constant eye contact or repeating names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Instead, true charisma stems from an individual's personality and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

[[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | Charisma]] is built upon three fundamental elements: presence, warmth, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. These elements must be applied in unison, as an imbalance can lead to issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Presence

Presence involves making the other person feel valued and strong, rather than focusing on displaying one's own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Active Listening

A key aspect of presence is being a good listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. When someone is speaking, focus entirely on what they are saying instead of formulating your response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This allows you to truly care about their words, making them feel heard and valued, which can naturally draw them to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This act of listening gives immense value to the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

### Comfort and Spontaneity

It is crucial to be comfortable in any setting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Your [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] should be relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. An uncomfortable demeanor can signal to others that you prefer not to be with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

To achieve this comfort, aim for spontaneity and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. This means allowing yourself to act naturally, such as sneezing when you need to, regardless of who is present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. This authenticity makes others feel closer to you, as you are mirroring the relaxed behavior typically reserved for close family or friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. When you are comfortable, others will also tend to relax around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

## Warmth

Warmth encompasses kindness, gentleness, affection, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, it's essential that this kindness is genuine, not hypocritical, as insincere niceness is easily detected and disliked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Emotional Communication

Human communication relies heavily on non-verbal cues: only 7% depends on words, while 93% depends on [[building_connections_and_nonverbal_communication | body language]], feelings, and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Your internal feelings and emotions significantly influence how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

To exude warmth, assume the person you're speaking to is good, and focus on their positive qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Cultivate an inner feeling of admiration and enthusiasm for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This genuine inner feeling will unconsciously radiate outwards, creating a connection and touching their heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Shared feelings are a fundamental aspect of human connection; your comfort, anger, or desire to be with someone will be reciprocated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### The Power of Giving

Adding value to others' lives through helpful advice is another component of warmth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Share information or advice without imposing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Give freely, but avoid insisting or following up relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### Acceptance, Understanding, and Honesty

Authenticity is key. If you don't like something, be honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. For example, if someone asks if you like football and you don't, say so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Constantly agreeing with others can make you seem boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

While being honest, also practice acceptance and understanding. Avoid negativity or belittling others' interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Accept people as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Sincere praise is encouraged, and honest, brief critiques can be shared with close friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Power

Power, the third element of charisma, requires inner strength, [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | self-confidence]], and a strong personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

### Core Principles of Power

1.  **Avoid excessive self-talk and seeking approval:** This point was discussed in an earlier episode of the social skills series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
2.  **Confrontation and boundaries:** Do not be afraid to uphold your principles and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. If faced with something that goes against your values, firmly say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Similarly, assert your needs and address issues directly, such as complaining about unsatisfactory service in a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
3.  **Strong [[body_language_and_selfconfidence_in_attracting_women | body language]]**: Your [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] is deeply connected to your mental state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. If you feel strong internally, it will naturally reflect in your posture and movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Conversely, consciously adopting strong [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] can positively influence your psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

    The simplest way to project strength through [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] is to **be comfortable** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. When you are at ease and allow your limbs to move freely, it fosters an internal feeling of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Imagine yourself as the most powerful person in the room; you would naturally take your space and sit comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Strive to maintain this comfort in your [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

For more in-depth understanding of [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | self-confidence]] and [[developing_a_confident_mindset | developing a confident mindset]], it is recommended to watch the dedicated video on [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | self-confidence]] within this series, as the episodes are interconnected and aim to transform one's self-perception and way of thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

Ultimately, charisma extends beyond simply making people like you; it contributes to efficient work, career advancement, and overall success in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

From the outset, the advice given is to let the woman chase, rather than doing the chasing oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. While this advice is commonly heard, putting it into practice can seem difficult, as many women state they would never chase anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, a woman is naturally drawn to a man she is actively chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. To understand this dynamic, it's crucial to differentiate between two types of chasing: logical and emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Types of Chasing

### Logical Chasing
Logical chasing occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear benefit she perceives, such as his wealth or high status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For example, if a man is rich, she might pursue him for financial gain, gifts, and a comfortable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

However, this type of chasing presents two significant problems:
1.  **Rarity and Difficulty** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>: Achieving high status or wealth is extremely rare for most people, with 99% not possessing these qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Strong Connection** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>: This type of pursuit will not lead to a strong, meaningful relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Her excitement will be for the money, not for the man himself, and she will constantly seek someone who can fulfill her core emotional needs that money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Logical chasing is not in a man's best interest if he desires a woman who loves and chases him for who he is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Emotional Chasing
Emotional chasing happens when a woman pursues a man due to genuine feelings and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions are beyond her control; she feels an irresistible urge to be with him and is willing to do anything for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This type of chasing fosters love, mutual enjoyment, and ensures the relationship's longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

> A woman will never truly love you or develop deep feelings for you unless this type of emotional chasing takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## The Two Main Stages of Attraction
In relationships, there are two primary stages: the hunting stage and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The first stage involves the man "hunting" the girl, and the second is when she begins to chase him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. These stages form the foundation for creating emotional chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

The dynamic can be likened to someone offering cigarettes, leading to addiction and eventually the recipient seeking out and paying for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Similarly, in romantic relationships, a man initially gives a woman attention, then pulls back, returning to give more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Over time, she craves that attention and begins to seek it out herself, effectively "paying the price" (subconsciously through attraction and intimacy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This process occurs subconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

## The Hunting Phase

The hunting phase is characterized by the man taking initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As a man, your role in the dating market is to choose, which necessitates taking the first step <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. This involves initiating conversation, taking the first step, and asking her out on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Asking for a Date: Hunter vs. Follower
While taking initiative, it's crucial not to chase or be a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This distinction is subtle but evident in how you ask for a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

*   **Follower Questions:** Asking "When can I see you?" or "When are you free?" puts the decision-making entirely on her, making you appear to follow her lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Hunter Statements:** Instead, use confident statements that indicate your intent and direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

| Follower Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a> | Hunter Statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> |
| :------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| When are you free to go out?           | Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever; you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice. |
| Would you like to go out with me sometime? | Message me, I've got a fun idea.                                                                                           |
| Can I get your number?                 | Put your number in my phone, let's stay in touch.                                                                           |
| Are you free on Saturday?              | We should grab a drink the next time we're both free. Let me know what your week looks like.                                    |

Don't ask, tell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. A woman wants a man who knows what to do and simply does it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The more confident you are in leading, the more comfortable she will feel following you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This embodies the difference between a follower and a hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Handling Date Rejection
If you ask a girl out and she declines with an excuse, do not suggest another day immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Simply respond with: "All right, no problem, let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### Communication Strategy
After meeting or a date, do not send her any messages or try to talk to her immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Instead, take a step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. After about a week, send her a message to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Stick to this system of messaging once a week to initiate and propose a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This approach allows you to take initiative without appearing to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

If she messages you while you are still in the hunting phase, it is perfectly fine to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The key is that you only initiate contact once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Continue this pattern until she starts messaging you daily and consistently engaging, which indicates she's developing feelings and initiating the [[Strategies for Navigating the Chasing Phase | chasing phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### During the Date

Your primary goal on a date should be to "jack up the energy of the interaction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

#### Punctuality
*   **Her Lateness:** Do not wait for more than 10 minutes if she is late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Leaving demonstrates that she is not the most important thing in your life and holds her accountable, preventing her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
*   **Your Lateness:** While some suggest intentionally being late to make her wait, it's generally better to be on time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Women are increasingly aware of such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

#### Conversation
Every topic and question should have an emotional impact on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Avoid generic, boring questions like "What do you do for work?" or "How was your day?" as these are common and won't make you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Instead, aim to connect on an emotional level by asking questions that resonate deeply with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

**Examples of Emotionally Resonant Questions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>:
*   "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?"
*   "When was the last time you laughed so hard?"
*   "If you were guaranteed not to fail, what would you want to become?"
*   "Who is the person you care about the most in your life?"

The key is to [[Maintaining attraction and emotional engagement | trigger her emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

#### The Kiss Test
When the conversation reaches a high level of emotional involvement, you can perform a "kiss test" to gauge her readiness for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. If she is emotionally charged, she will typically not refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:01]</a>.

#### Ending the Date
End the date when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having a great time, preventing it from becoming boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The final step is to leave without explicitly promising another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Maintaining [[Role of absence and mystery in building attraction | mystery]] by not mentioning a follow-up meeting is a powerful technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

By continuing to give her space and meeting her once a week for a period, you will eventually reach a point where she is consistently messaging and calling you daily, signaling the transition into the [[Strategies for Navigating the Chasing Phase | chasing phase]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

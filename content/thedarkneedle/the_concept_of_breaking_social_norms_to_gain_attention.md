A method of speaking called [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudence]] can make a person capable of making any girl chase them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | Impudence]] is defined as a lack of modesty or boldness with a slight disregard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Why Breaking Social Norms Works

In a woman's eyes, an [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudent]] man is perceived as capable of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Attraction is an instinctive phenomenon, unrelated to logic or modern principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The primary trait a woman seeks in a man is his ability to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In a survival scenario, the "selfish, strong, and harsh" individual is more likely to survive, and women are instinctively drawn to such a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This genetic wiring leads women to seek the [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudent]] man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Despite changing circumstances where survival is not constantly necessary, these instinctive rules still apply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | Impudence]] and [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] are traits that lead a woman to deeply love and become attached to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Exhibiting this type of boldness and [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudence]] can lead to an obsessive attachment from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This should be conveyed through speech, especially at the beginning of interactions, but with moderation and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Elements of [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | Impudence]]

[[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | Impudence]], in conversation, consists of four key elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

### Be a Little Cheeky

Being cheeky means being mischievous in your manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The goal is to make the other person wonder, "Did he really just say that or did he really just do that?" and to break the mold of typical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This style works effectively by breaking the "boredom trance" that often occurs in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. By making unexpected comments and being slightly [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudent]], you interrupt her usual pattern and gain her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Cheekiness involves acting as if you don't know your place and showing too much familiarity too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many men do the opposite, becoming overly careful and formal, which leads to them being perceived as strangers, making it difficult to spark physical attraction or emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This is a form of [[changing_behavior_to_avoid_being_ignored_by_women | changing behavior to avoid being ignored by women]].

One effective way to be cheeky and avoid neutrality is to offer unsolicited advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. For example, telling a girl with blonde hair, "You'd look really beautiful with black hair," demonstrates excessive familiarity and grabs attention through shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This creates an emotional response because she is surprised, as women rarely experience such surprising interactions with new acquaintances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This type of advice is edgy without being rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Be Bold

[[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Boldness]] is the most attractive trait to all humans, not just girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. It involves taking risks, whether real or potential for embarrassment, without overthinking the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key is to focus entirely on the present action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

When interacting with women, men should be bold by initiating conversations, flirting, and physical moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Simple bold actions can have a significant impact on those around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. People are drawn to bold individuals because they do the unexpected, breaking the boredom of repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Shy individuals, who fear risk, are generally less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This [[encouraging_admiration_and_influence_in_social_circles | encourages admiration and influence in social circles]].

Examples of [[using_boldness_and_cheekiness_in_conversations | using boldness and cheekiness in conversations]] with women include:
*   Telling a girl who is talking too much or raising her voice, "Shut your trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is a phrase typically reserved for close friends or partners, making it shocking to a stranger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Directly stating, "I just totally caught you staring at me," if you notice a girl looking at you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This playful [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] surprises her and makes her question the normality of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Being bold early in a conversation can set an emotionally charged, attractive tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Be Shameless

[[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Shamelessness]], when attractive, means having the courage to speak things as they are or say what you're thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. It's about saying what isn't usually said, similar to how a child might blurt out an observation everyone else is thinking but is too shy to voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This should be done without being hurtful; for example, it's not acceptable to insult someone's appearance or disability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

Examples of smart [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | shamelessness]]:
*   Referring back to something she said and expressing your honest reaction, such as, "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This shows you're not reserved and don't hide your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   Responding to a girl's mention of "girls' night" with "Does that mean you don't shave your legs?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This is a personal and surprising question that can then escalate into a deeper conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   Pointing out an obvious truth, like commenting on a girlfriend's height by saying, "I didn't see you. I didn't notice at first that you're short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This demonstrates a lack of shame and willingness to address the "elephant in the room" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   Filling in unstated details in a story, such as responding to a dating app story by saying, "Ah, so the sex got boring or no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This is attractive [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | shamelessness]] that doesn't hurt anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Always pointing out the "elephant in the room," especially in mixed groups, by saying what everyone is thinking but is too shy to say, is a valuable piece of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Be Slightly Disrespectful

To master [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudence]], one must be slightly disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This does not mean being insulting or treating her poorly, but rather giving her the same level of respect you would give your best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Friends are typically not treated with excessive politeness or formality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Most men treat women with excessive respect, similar to how they might treat a principal, which prevents any emotional reaction and makes it impossible to spark attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Over-respecting a woman can lead her to believe she is better than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The ideal approach is to treat her like a best friend, even upon first meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

A way to be slightly disrespectful is by not directly responding to her questions immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many men feel obliged to give long, thoughtful answers to every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Instead, you can completely ignore her question initially, then return to it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. For example, if she asks, "So, where did you grow up?" you could respond with, "Oh, so last night I was out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. This shows she is not controlling the conversation and makes it more interesting and unpredictable, triggering attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. It also makes her feel that she needs to "win you over," as you are not simply submitting because she is pretty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

Applying the principles of [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudence]]—being cheeky, [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | bold]], [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | shameless]], and slightly [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | disrespectful]]—can lead to women chasing you and valuing your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This is because these behaviors plant the idea that you are a strong man who is fearless and does not give excessive attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

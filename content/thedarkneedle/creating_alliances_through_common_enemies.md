Our brains are naturally wired to react more strongly to negatives than to positives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This means the brain is programmed to flee from danger more than it is to seek out something good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This fundamental principle can be leveraged to swiftly create strong connections and [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | emotional connections]] with others, particularly women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Power of Shared Dislikes
While finding common interests (like a shared love for a song or movie) is a good method for breaking the ice, identifying shared dislikes can be significantly more effective and faster for building attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. From experience, finding something you both hate has been one of the most effective ways to foster strong attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This is because we tend to [[bonding_over_shared_dislikes | bond more over the people we hate than the ones we love]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Brain's Bias
> Our brain reacts to negatives more strongly than positives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. It's programmed to run away from danger rather than seek good things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Common Enemies
Historically, having a common enemy has been one of the most potent ways to build alliances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. It is also one of the strongest factors that draws people to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

**Forms of Shared Hatred:**
*   **Common societal issues:** This could include a mutual dislike for social media and its superficiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, or how dating apps have made relationships difficult and meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Disliked individuals:** If both parties dislike the same person – such as a boss, a teacher, or an annoying customer – this can quickly create a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. People often find it easier to name individuals they dislike than those they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Simple dislikes:** It can be something as simple as a food you both dislike, a city you find boring, or a TV show or movie you both consider terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

### Practical Application
To leverage this principle:
1.  **Ask direct questions:** One of the best questions to ask is, "What is the thing you hate the most? Who is your enemy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
2.  **Express shared dislike passionately:** If you also dislike the same thing, express your feelings with passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This emotional expression is crucial for forging a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
3.  **Listen and observe:** Even if you don't share the same hatred for a person, ask why they dislike them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Listen carefully and observe their passionate and emotional expression of hatred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Getting someone to talk about who they hate can significantly speed up the bonding process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### "Partners in Crime" Dynamic
A powerful technique related to shared hatred is creating a "partners in crime" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, which fosters a "You and Me Against the World" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   **Inside jokes:** Secretly pranking co-workers or having inside jokes about certain customers can create an exclusive bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Shared adversity:** Being "in trouble" together, such as getting yelled at by a boss, and then commiserating or talking trash about the boss afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This establishes an "us against them" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

By utilizing this instinct of [[bonding_over_shared_dislikes | bonding through negative emotions]], you can build strong alliances and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

When seeking to [[understanding female attraction | attract women]], commonly suggested methods like having a strong body, possessing wealth, or mastering seduction are often misguided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In reality, individuals in healthy relationships who successfully [[understanding female attraction | attract women]] often don't rely on these superficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[understanding female attraction | Attracting women]] is simpler than many believe, requiring a return to the fundamental [[core_concepts_of_attraction_and_polarity | principles of attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## The Foundation: Mindset and Emotion

[[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | Success with women]] is primarily a state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. What is in one's mind will manifest in actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Many men fail to [[understanding female attraction | attract women]] because they don't believe they deserve the company of an attractive woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

A crucial principle to remember is "she feels what you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Women judge men based on the feelings circulating within them, not primarily on looks, words, or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. These feelings are reflected in one's personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For example, nervousness often leads to rejection because the woman senses a lack of [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Conversely, approaching with [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]], calmness, and relaxation elicits a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, one must demonstrate self-perception as a man women naturally desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Pitfalls to Avoid in Attraction

### Don't Put Her on a Pedestal or Seek Approval

Attempting to win a woman over by pandering to her every whim is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Placing a woman on a pedestal, as if she were a future spouse, indicates an inner sense of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This hidden deficiency drives men to try too hard to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The most effective way to impress a woman is by *not* trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. When a man stops seeking her approval, she becomes genuinely impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is because she is accustomed to men trying to woo her, so someone who doesn't stands out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

> "The moment you stop seeking her approval that's when she'll genuinely be wowed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

The quest for validation is deeply rooted in self-perception and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Men who constantly seek approval often struggle with low self-esteem, surrendering their power for acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This implies a fear of rejection even before interaction begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. An approval-seeker's internal monologue might involve hoping everything unfolds well with a beautiful woman, leading him to try too hard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. From a woman's perspective, this behavior is unexciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. The desperate need for approval is a major attraction deterrent; a woman will lose interest almost immediately if she senses this craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### Be Indifferent to the Outcome (Rejection)

Men who effortlessly [[understanding female attraction | attract women]] do not tie themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. While rejection can be devastating for many, those who excel at [[understanding female attraction | attracting women]] understand that rejection is an insignificant component of the dating landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. They are not perturbed by a woman's reaction, focusing instead on enjoying the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. When indifferent to the outcome, a man doesn't fret about the woman's response and focuses on making the most of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Don't Overvalue Physical Attractiveness

It is a common tendency for men to lose control at the sight of an attractive woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. However, physical attractiveness is not something a woman necessarily works for, so she shouldn't be placed on a "divine pedestal" for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Behaving unusually or nervously around an attractive woman will likely ruin the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

If a man avoids being overly nice solely based on a woman's looks, an intriguing phenomenon occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. When a man doesn't readily hand over validation like the average guy, the woman begins to seek his validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. She might question if she measures up, striving to prove her worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This instantly categorizes the man as different and unique, sparking genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Regardless of a woman's beauty, the right approach to [[core_concepts_of_attraction_and_polarity | attraction]] can captivate any woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

## Pillars of a High-Value Man

### Have High Standards and Don't Settle

A man who understands [[core_concepts_of_attraction_and_polarity | attraction]] does not rush into marriage; instead, he *chooses* the women he dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Many men settle for available women when their ideal seems unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. A man who truly understands [[core_concepts_of_attraction_and_polarity | attraction]] never settles; he pursues the best and selects the women he genuinely wants to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He has high standards and adheres to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### Uphold Your Principles

A man of value prioritizes his principles above all else, including the woman he's with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He is not afraid to withdraw if his principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. While an average guy might apologize and compromise his values to prevent a woman from leaving, a high-value man reacts differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. He won't compromise his principles, knowing there are other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. He is [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confident]] in his worth and unafraid to stand alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### Make Her Strive for Your Attention

Humans tend to undervalue things that come too easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This applies to relationships: women value men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. When a man doesn't react like the average male, a woman begins to perceive something special about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. It's crucial to learn how to make a woman strive for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Don't be an "open book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. A strategy involves showing interest and then quickly showing disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

> A high-value man might say, "You're pretty sure but I'm not convinced we get along. You seem like too much of a goody two shoes for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>
> This provokes a strong emotional reaction, making her curious because he's not afraid to challenge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### Don't Change Who You Are

A common mistake men make is modifying their behavior or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, often stemming from a fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Adapting to a woman's preferences implies viewing her as higher value and sending a message that you need to change to match that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

> "You shouldn't alter who you are just to make a woman feel at ease." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>

If a woman doesn't appreciate certain aspects of you, she doesn't deserve you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. If she can't accept you as you are, then she is the one who needs to change, or adapt to your reality if she wants to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. A high-value man is not overly concerned with others' opinions; he shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Adopt an Abundance Mindset

A high-value man understands there's no shortage of attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. He doesn't fixate on one woman, putting all his hopes in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. If one woman rejects him, he knows there are plenty of other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. He sees abundance, not scarcity, when it comes to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

When a girl ignores you, it's often because she perceives you as a guy with limited options, someone who gives too much attention and is willing to do anything to please her, suggesting you don't believe you have much value beyond her notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. She might feel you're chasing her because she's the only one you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

A common mistake is to lie about having many options, for instance, by making up stories about imaginary girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This approach is detrimental because it either leads to her discovering you're lying (which is a significant attraction killer) or she realizes you're trying to convey you have options, which signals that you are [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | seeking her approval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Both outcomes worsen the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

Instead of lying, the key is to interact with her in a way that suggests you have options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This is achieved through a method known as the [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | qualifying technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## The Qualifying Technique

Qualifying means screening or filtering, a behavior typically exhibited by individuals who have many options and need to choose among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you subtly communicate that you have abundant options, as only guys with options would engage in such filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This technique is highly effective for solidifying a girl's attraction, moving beyond casual flirting to a deeper interest where she wants to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The mantra to remember is: "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Qualifying makes her feel like you're choosing her over others, and that she's winning you over not just for her looks, but for who she is as a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If you don't qualify her, she might assume you're just trying to "get into her pants" or that you lack options and would settle for any girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Conversely, when you do qualify her, she'll perceive you as choosy, with options, and that you've selected her for a specific, special reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Here are three ways to qualify a girl and make her feel special:

### 1. The Qualifying Question

Ask her a question that prompts her to share positive qualities about herself, and then acknowledge her for those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

*   **Example**: "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason, I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you, and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
    *   This question will make her consider what qualities would make you like her more, prompting her to "sell herself" to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
    *   When she shares, and you accept it with a statement like, "Wow, that's really cool. I like that about you," she'll feel special, not like a random girl, and that you're genuinely interested in who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This also helps you learn more about her and find new conversation topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Another Example**: "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to, and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

It's crucial to accept whatever she tells you, otherwise, she might feel rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. When you accept her, she'll feel she's won you over with her personality, not just her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. This is especially important for attractive women who are often tired of being valued solely for their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This approach distinguishes you as someone with standards who filters options and chose her because she is special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've noticed in her, then invite her to confirm it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If she accepts your statement as true, she'll feel good and start acting more consistently with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **Example**: "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open, and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
    *   The goal is to end the statement with a question that encourages her to say "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Once she confirms (e.g., "Yeah, I guess I'm pretty open"), she'll begin to act more openly around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.
    *   Ensure the statement is genuine and something she would feel good about affirming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. She'll feel you recognize something valuable and unique about her, fostering a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
*   **Another Example**: "You know what I like about you? You're so bold. Like, you don't filter yourself at all, you just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing. It makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>

Keep the statement open-ended, positive, and vague enough that she can't definitively disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. When you frame her as possessing a certain quality and she accepts it, she'll embody that trait to be accepted, feeling special and fortunate to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This can lead to her opening up emotionally and feeling a deep connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

*   **Common Qualities to Look For**: Open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **For Extremely Attractive Women**: "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> Attractive women often wish their intelligence was recognized more, as most people only notice their beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. People tend to devalue compliments they hear often and appreciate recognition for qualities they secretly wish were acknowledged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself

Often, girls will qualify themselves to you without you having to initiate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Your role is to notice and acknowledge her for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Examples of a girl qualifying herself**:
    *   Bragging or telling you positive things about herself, hoping for your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   Touching you or showing direct interest, demonstrating she likes you and wants you to like her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
    *   Asking if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you sense she is qualifying herself (intending to impress you and gain your liking), acknowledge her by telling her what she's doing is cool, that you like her, or by showing physical acceptance like putting your arm around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. This lets her know she's winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

If you fail to acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and withdraw, becoming cold or indifferent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, when you acknowledge and accept her, she'll feel great and continue to pursue your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Pay attention to these instances, as they happen frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

This principle extends beyond romantic interactions; acknowledging qualities you appreciate in anyone makes them feel seen and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. You can start conversations with friends by saying, "You know what I like about you?" or "Hold up, I got to acknowledge you for just a minute. When was the last time someone told you how awesome you are for doing XYZ?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>

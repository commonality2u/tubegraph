Effective communication in relationships, as discussed in the context of dating and long-term partnerships, involves specific strategies for expressing preferences, maintaining standards, and understanding a partner's indirect cues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This approach emphasizes the man taking a leadership role in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Core Strategy: State Your Desires Without Force or Need

The fundamental principle for effective communication is to "tell her what you want, but you don't force it on her at the same time you should not need her to do what you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This involves three key ideas:

### 1. How to Communicate Your Desires

*   **Wait for Her to Ask**: Do not proactively state your preferences, especially early in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Wait until she asks about your tastes or preferences, for example, regarding clothing styles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **State Your Taste, Do Not Justify**: When she asks, simply state your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Do not justify your opinion, try to convince her, or engage in a debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Just say "this is your taste" and step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Do Not Change Your Opinion**: Even if she pressures you or tries to change your mind, remain firm in your stated opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Changing your opinion can lead to a loss of your [[strategies_for_maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | leadership]] position and her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

### 2. How Not to Force Your Desires

*   **Communicate Indifferently**: Express your preference in a "cold and indifferent manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Do not present it as a major issue or a condition for the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Frame it as merely sharing what you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### 3. How Not to Show Your Need

*   **Do Not Show Attachment or Need**: Avoid conveying that you need her to make a change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Ignore Non-Compliance**: If she doesn't immediately adopt your preference, do not talk about it or give it attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Acting as if nothing happened shows you don't *need* the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This strategy is believed to lead her to make the desired change over time, especially as her attachment to you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

## Maintaining Your Leadership Position

A crucial aspect of [[effective_communication_strategies | effective communication strategies]] is to always maintain your [[strategies_for_maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | leadership]] position in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Never change your thoughts or yourself because of the girl you are with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Doing so can cause her to lose attraction and prevent her from changing for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. The goal is for the girl to align her personality, thoughts, and behavior with yours because she wants to please you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Responding to Specific Communication Cues

### When a Woman Talks About Other Men

A common scenario is a woman talking about other men in front of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This can be interpreted in two ways:

1.  **To Indicate Desirability**: If she talks about other men asking her out or complimenting her, she is likely trying to impress you and convey that she is desired by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. In this case, she wants you to ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Do not show jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
2.  **To Friend-Zone You**: If she talks about an ex-boyfriend she still loves, how she can't get over him, or how she wants him back, she is likely trying to dump her emotional baggage on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This is a classic sign of being put in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. In this situation, it is advised to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

### Dealing with "Red Flags"

While traditional "red flags" like a girl having male friends are dismissed as "nonsense" because they imply a lack of interaction with men, which is counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>, certain "real" red flags are considered unchangeable traits that will lead to suffering if ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. These include:

*   **Flirting with Other Men**: If a girl flirts with other men in your presence, she is likely seeking attention or trying to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Do not show jealousy, as this gives her control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. It's better to end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Still Attached to an Ex**: If a girl is still thinking about her ex and hasn't gotten over him, she is carrying heavy emotional baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. A "high value man" should suggest she give her ex another chance, showing willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. If she chooses the ex, you've avoided a "drama queen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Energy-Sucking Women**: This is the most dangerous red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. These women are deeply insecure, constantly seek validation that can never be fulfilled, and may use sex as a tool for emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. They often have low self-esteem, are drama queens, and can be manipulative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. It is important to identify and walk away from such relationships for your emotional health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

To cultivate a lasting and enjoyable romantic relationship, it is essential for a woman to [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | chase]] a man emotionally, rather than logically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. While logical chasing stems from perceived benefits like wealth or status, it rarely leads to deep, meaningful relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. [[creating_emotional_attachment_through_conversation | Emotional chasing]], however, arises from genuine feelings and love, making her actions beyond her control and fostering a desire to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. This article focuses on the "hunting" phase, where you lay the groundwork for building emotional connections.

## The Hunting Phase: Initiating the Connection

As a man, your role in the dating dynamic is to be the "chooser" and take the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. This means initiating conversations, taking the first step, and asking her out on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### Asking for a Date: Hunter Statements vs. Follower Questions

When asking for a date, adopt the mindset of a "hunter" rather than a "follower" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>. Avoid follower questions that put the decision-making in her court, such as "When can I see you?" or "What do you like to do for fun?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Instead, use "hunter statements" that convey confidence and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.

Consider these examples:
*   **Follower:** "When are you free to go out?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>
*   **Hunter:** "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever, you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>

*   **Follower:** "Can I get your number?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>
*   **Hunter:** "Put your number in my phone, let's stay in touch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>

> "She doesn't want someone timidly asking her what she wants; she wants you to know what to do and just do it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>

If she declines a date with an excuse, do not suggest an alternative time immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Simply respond with "All right, no problem, let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### Post-Date Communication in the Hunting Phase

After a date, take a step back and avoid sending immediate messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. Initiate contact again after about a week to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>. This approach maintains initiative without appearing to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. If she messages you first during this phase, it's acceptable to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Continue this pattern until she consistently messages you daily, indicating she is developing feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>.

## The Date: Igniting Emotional Engagement

On the date itself, your primary objective is to [[techniques_for_emotional_engagement | jack up the energy of the interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.

### Punctuality

If your date is more than 10 minutes late, you should leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. This demonstrates that you have other priorities and sets a boundary, preventing her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. While some advise arriving late intentionally, it's generally better to be on time as women are more aware of such tactics today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

### [[creating_positive_emotional_connections_through_dialogue | Engaging Emotionally Through Dialogue]]

Every question and topic you introduce should have an emotional impact on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Avoid generic, "boring" questions like "What do you do for work?" or "How was your day?", as she has likely heard these countless times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. The goal is to [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | connect with her on an emotional level]] and [[triggering_emotional_responses_during_conversations | spark her emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

Ask questions that [[emotionally_connecting_through_past_experiences | emotionally resonate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>:
*   "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:50">[09:24:50]</a>
*   "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:10">[09:30:10]</a>
*   "If you were guaranteed not to fail, what would you want to become?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>
*   "Who is the person you care about the most in your life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:20">[09:34:20]</a>

### The Kiss Test and Ending the Date

When the conversation reaches a high level of emotional involvement, consider performing a "kiss test" to gauge her readiness for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Typically, an emotionally charged woman will not refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.

End the date while the energy is at its peak and you're both having a great time, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. To maintain mystery, leave without explicitly promising another date (e.g., "Let's meet again" or "I'll call you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. Continue to give her space and meet once a week for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.

## Transition to the Chasing Phase

You know you've successfully built emotional connection and transitioned to the "chasing phase" when the girl consistently messages and calls you daily, wanting to meet frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. At this point, it's crucial to not always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. If she calls, don't always answer, and if she asks to meet, sometimes tell her you're busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

Being constantly available can lead to her getting bored and her feelings cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This deliberate distancing, applied only once she is attached, is not manipulation; it fulfills a woman's desire for a challenge and drama in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. A girl desires a man who challenges her, not one who is overly compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>. If she then attempts to distance herself to test you, remain calm and do not pursue her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>. Always remember to "be the hunter, not the chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>.

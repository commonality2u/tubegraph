Many common beliefs about how to attract women—such as needing a strong body, money, or seduction skills—are superficial and often unnecessary for entering healthy relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. In reality, [[Authentic Approach to Attracting Women | attracting women]] is simpler than commonly believed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. [[Authentic Approach to Attracting Women | Success with women]] stems from a state of mind, which directly influences a man's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Women assess men based on the feelings they project, not on superficial traits like looks, words, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Seeking Approval

When men try too hard to impress or win a woman over, they often reveal an underlying sense of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This hidden deficiency drives them to make excessive efforts to gain her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The moment a man stops [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | seeking a woman's approval]], that's when she becomes genuinely impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is because women are accustomed to men constantly trying to woo them, so a different, non-impressive approach captures their interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | quest for validation]] is deeply connected to a man's self-perception and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Men who continually [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | seek approval]] often struggle with low self-esteem, trading their personal power for acceptance or validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This behavior is driven by an underlying fear of rejection, prompting them to do anything to avoid it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Such men are frequently unsure of their actions, leading them to [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | seek validation]] from the woman to confirm they are on the right track <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### The Approval Seeker's Mindset

When an approval-seeking man encounters an attractive woman, his mental process often follows this pattern:
1.  He develops a strong interest, thinking, "She's strikingly beautiful; I hope everything unfolds well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
2.  This mindset compels him to try too hard, sacrificing his power for a small amount of approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### The Woman's Reaction

When a woman senses a man's craving for her approval, she can lose interest almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Attraction is not something she can consciously control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. The desperate need for approval acts as a major deterrent to attraction; as long as a man is [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | seeking her approval]], she is unlikely to show genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### The Dangers of Prioritizing Looks

A common tendency is for men to lose control when encountering an attractive woman, awarding her extra points simply for her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This happens despite physical attractiveness being something she didn't necessarily work for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Behaving unusually or jittery around an attractive woman often leads to fumbling and ruining the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

However, if a man avoids giving extra niceties solely based on her looks, an intriguing phenomenon occurs: she begins to [[techniques_to_trigger_a_womans_desire_for_approval | seek his validation]] because he didn't readily offer it like an average guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This categorizes him as a unique and different guy a woman would be genuinely interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Compromising Self and Standards

A common [[avoiding_common_mistakes_when_attracting_women | mistake many men make]] is altering their behavior or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, usually out of fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This sends a message that the man views her as having higher value, and he needs to change to match that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. The truth is, a man shouldn't alter who he is to make a woman comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. If she doesn't appreciate certain aspects of him, she doesn't deserve him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. If she wants to be with him, she should adapt to his reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

Men who seek approval also tend to settle for women who are merely available, rather than pursuing the type of woman they truly desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This contrasts sharply with a high-value man who has high standards and chooses the women he dates, never settling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### The High-Value Man's Approach

Men who effortlessly attract women do not tie themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. They understand that rejection is insignificant and merely a part of the dating landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their primary concern is to enjoy the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. When a man is indifferent to the outcome, he doesn't worry about the woman's response; his focus remains on making the most of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

A high-value man:
*   Puts his principles above all else, even the woman he is with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Is not afraid to step back if his principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   Knows there are many other options available and is confident in his worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   Understands that things that come too easily are often overlooked, and women value men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   Doesn't fixate on one woman, seeing abundance rather than scarcity when it comes to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

By not reacting like the average man, a high-value man makes a woman think there must be something special about him, prompting her to [[techniques_to_trigger_a_womans_desire_for_approval | strive for his attention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This approach makes a woman incredibly curious because the man is not afraid to challenge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. A high-value man shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

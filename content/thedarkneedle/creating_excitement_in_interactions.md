To make someone feel attracted to you, the key is to stir their emotions, specifically through what is described as "drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This involves making them think about you and feel a range of emotions that release love hormones, leading to attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The crucial point is that *you* must be the source of these emotions, not external factors like a beautiful location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>.

## Key Ingredients for Creating Excitement

The approach to generating excitement involves a combination of specific conversational and behavioral techniques:

### 1. Mixing Attention with Indifference

Creating excitement involves a deliberate blend of showing attention and a touch of indifference in your conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This means sometimes offering a compliment and other times a critique, but always in a way that stirs emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Incorrect Approaches**
    *   Simply stating, "This dress doesn't look good on you" or "You look beautiful in this dress" does not evoke excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Correct Approach: Showing Interest with a Hint of Indifference**
    *   The pattern should involve one line showing interest and another showing a slight disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. For example, "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This conveys interest without appearing to be chasing her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Correct Approach: Showing Interest by Reversing the Structure**
    *   To emphasize interest while maintaining the blend, reverse the sentence structure. For instance, "If this dress were pink, it would be better, but still it looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. As humans, we tend to remember the last thing said, so ending on a positive note is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
*   **Creating Emotional Fluctuations**
    *   Statements like, "You're so short but still you're adorable" create a slight emotional dip followed by a rise, and this rise and fall is what generates excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **When to Show Complete Attention**
    *   It is appropriate to show complete attention when the other person does something you explicitly like, such as wearing a color you've previously mentioned favoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### 2. Being Enjoyable to Spend Time With

To ensure that exciting and fun thoughts come to mind every time she thinks of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>, focus on three key points:

*   **Mindset Shift**
    *   Instead of trying too hard to make her laugh or entertain her, focus on enjoying your own time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Be positive, relaxed, and fully present in the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Say things that amuse you, not just to amuse her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | Spontaneity]] is crucial for making others feel they're having a good time with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Be comfortable and focus on what makes you laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Talking About Passions**
    *   Remember the principle: "She feels what you feel; her emotions are a reflection of yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. When you discuss topics you're passionate and excited about, your joy and enthusiasm will be contagious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. [[using_passion_and_enthusiasm_to_enhance_conversations | Passion]] can transform even a simple subject like cooking into an engaging conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Turning Negativity into Positivity**
    *   A golden formula to create a positive emotional response involves:
        1.  Noticing a flaw or negative aspect in her personality or appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
        2.  Pointing it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
        3.  Immediately transforming it into something positive to make her feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
        *   For example, if she's wearing heavy makeup, you could say, "Do you always wear this much makeup or is it just for special occasions?" and then immediately follow up with, "Don't worry, you still look cute with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This approach often results in laughter and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### 3. Creating Anticipation and Curiosity

This feeling is generated through two main techniques:

*   **Unfinished Conversation**
    *   Spark intense interest in something you say or do, then, at the peak of excitement, pull back and leave her eager for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   Examples:
        *   "Oh, I completely forgot I was supposed to tell you something really important... wait, I have to make an important phone call. I'll tell you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
        *   "I've noticed something fascinating and strange about you. Do you know what it is?" (When she asks, reply: "Well, I'll tell you later. Now's not the right time") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
    *   Leaving an incomplete story, such as mentioning "two habits I hate in women" but only revealing the first and then changing the subject, makes her wait and increases her excitement and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    *   This technique makes her think about you all day, fostering a strong sense of [[creating_attraction_through_uncertainty | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

*   **Ending Dates Strategically**
    *   Leave a date without immediately revealing your feelings, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   Avoid spending too much time together to the point of boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. The ideal time to end a date is when the conversation is at its peak and both are having fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
    *   Do not promise another meeting (e.g., "Let's meet again" or "I'll call you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
    *   This approach [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintains mystery]], making her wonder if you enjoyed your time and why you didn't ask for another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This confusion keeps you on her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
    *   Never reveal your true feelings too early, as this can kill the element of [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | mystery]] and lead to a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. This uncertainty is a primary factor in attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   Even if she confesses her love, she should still want you more than you want her. Achieve this by showing you're ready to walk away if your principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. A high-value man prioritizes his principles and demonstrates a willingness to disengage if they are crossed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   Keep her eager to learn more by maintaining a state of guessing through [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This means not giving away too much information too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. For example, if asked "Where do you work?" respond with "Guess, and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This creates an aura of mystery and encourages future interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.

### 4. Creating Emotional Responses

A crucial emotion a woman should feel is jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

*   If not in a serious relationship and asked if you're dating others, admit it by saying, "Yes, there are a few girls I go out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. This prompts her to work harder to keep you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   In an exclusive relationship, occasional interaction with other women or female friends can still evoke some jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. If she expresses jealousy, make it clear she is the one who truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Women enjoy competition and feeling like the winner, which makes them see you as a prize and increases their attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### 5. Fostering a Sense of Safety

A woman will not enter into a physical relationship unless she feels [[developing_warmth_in_interactions | comfortable and safe]] with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

*   The most essential tip for creating safety is to ensure that what you present aligns with your true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Appearing fake, such as pretending interest in a topic you don't care about just to impress her, undermines trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Be honest with your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   Another strategy is to choose horror movies for dates, as her fear may cause her to cling to you, and your lack of fear will create a sense of security for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### 6. Embracing Disagreements

Do not be afraid to engage in a debate or disagreement from time to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. Constantly agreeing with her signals a lack of self-respect and fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Women seek a challenge, and constant agreement makes you unchallenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

A good mix of all these emotions, unpredictability, and maintaining a slight sense of [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | mystery]] is the perfect recipe for long-term attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Avoid letting any single emotion dominate, as this can lead to boredom and a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. By keeping her guessing about your next move and maintaining an element of [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | unpredictability]], you can consistently evoke these [[triggering_emotional_responses_during_conversations | emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>.

For individuals who find themselves consistently overlooked by women, experiencing a lack of attention, or perpetually pursuing romantic interests without success, the underlying issue is often rooted in behavior rather than external factors like financial status or physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This problem is not resolved by simply focusing on personal wealth or fitness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Even significant financial success will primarily attract individuals seeking to exploit you financially if the core behavioral problem persists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The solution lies in fundamentally changing one's approach and demeanor when interacting with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## The Core Problem: Neediness

When a man desires a woman's approval, he often makes an effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This can manifest as agreeing with her interests (e.g., liking the beach if she does) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, buying her gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, or altering his natural [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] and speech to appear "special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Such efforts signal a "need" for the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The "number one killer of attraction" is [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | neediness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Neediness isn't expressed verbally but is something a woman senses when a man goes out of his way to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This perceived [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | neediness]] is the primary reason women begin to ignore men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. To prevent being ignored, a man must not be needy, which requires him to stop making an effort and to remain in his natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The moment a woman observes a man stepping outside his natural self, she will automatically begin to ignore him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Conversely, a man being his authentic self around a woman he doesn't even like is often why she ends up liking him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Manipulative tactics like delaying replies, blocking, or purposefully arriving late to dates are not genuine solutions, as women often detect these strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Strategies for Non-Neediness and Self-Confidence

The path to stopping women from ignoring you involves making them feel that you don't need them and maintaining your natural state around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | mindset]] cultivates genuine [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]].

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion

Focus entirely on enjoying your time without concern for the outcome or whether the woman approves of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This involves being detached from the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Playful Teasing**: Engage in playful, non-aggressive actions you might do with a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. For example, lightly tapping her head with a plastic bottle and saying "Sh" in a joking manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, or patting her head and saying "Good girl" if she performs a small favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Such actions demonstrate that you are being yourself and doing what you want, without caring about her judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Authentic Responses**: When she shares something, respond naturally. If she mentions a low exam score, playfully call her "stupid" and laugh, rather than offering generic sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. If she fell, laugh and ask how it happened (assuming she's clearly okay and able to joke) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This conveys enjoyment without needing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Maintain Personal Habits**: If you smoke and she complains, don't immediately change your behavior or move away. Respond simply, like "Don't worry, I'll just finish this one," and continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Let her adjust if she's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself

Avoid making excessive efforts that are out of character for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

*   **Date Locations**: Choose date locations you would typically frequent with a friend, rather than expensive restaurants or places outside your lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Parks or free places can lead to excellent dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This shows you don't need her, as you are simply integrating her into your existing life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Taking her to a place where people know you (e.g., a familiar cafe) reinforces that she's an addition to your normal life, not a reason for you to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Appearance**: Dress normally and simply, prioritizing comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Avoid overly extravagant clothing or excessive grooming, which indicates an effort to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Being relaxed in your attire signals that you aren't trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Accept Flaws**: If she criticizes an ability, don't try to prove her wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Laugh, acknowledge it, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Be open about your flaws and don't pretend to be someone you're not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Resist Meeting Standards**: If she sets standards (e.g., "I like guys who go to the gym"), don't try to conform to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Instead, flip the situation into a joke, like saying "You've got great taste" or "Yeah, I like guys like that, too," and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. Many women use this as a trick to see if you will chase their standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### 3. Never Compete Over Her

Avoid situations where you are vying for a woman's attention against other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Avoid Seeking Approval**: Trying to tell the best joke, appear strongest, or recount the most exciting story to gain a woman's approval indicates [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | neediness]] and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Stay calm, be natural, and act as if no women are present, simply enjoying the social gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Elevate Other Men**: One of the most impactful ways to impress women is to uplift other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. If another man tells a joke, laugh heartily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. If someone shares an impressive story, don't try to one-up him; instead, applaud and highlight his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Women notice when a man doesn't compete and instead acts confident and self-assured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Don't Be Jealous**: If you see a woman you like with another man, do not ask about him or try to learn details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Introduce Her to Friends (Optional)**: In some cases, introducing a woman you are dating to a more "handsome" friend can demonstrate immense [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | self-confidence]] and a complete lack of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. When they meet, never show jealousy or fear that he might "take" her from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### 4. [[Body language techniques during conversations | Body Language]]

Your [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] should primarily reflect comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Forget online advice about specific postures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

*   **Prioritize Comfort**: Sit or stand in any position that feels comfortable to you â€“ hands in pockets, on your head, leaning back, stretching out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Natural Movement**: Walk and move in a way that feels natural, rather than trying to adopt an overly deliberate or "masculine" gait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

Always remember: you don't need the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. While you may like her, you will not exert effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. By applying these behaviors, a woman will perceive you as someone who doesn't need her, ensuring you are not ignored because you haven't given her a reason to ignore you in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.

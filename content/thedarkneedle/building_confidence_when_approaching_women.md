[[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | Confidence]] is crucial when [[approaching_women_in_public | approaching women]]. Staying calm and relaxed before an approach generally leads to positive outcomes, whereas nervousness can make you seem less confident and result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Overcoming Fear and Developing a Confident Mindset

For those new to [[approaching_women_in_public | approaching women]] in social settings, getting into the right mindset can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The most effective way to overcome anxiety about approaching is to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

### Starting Small

Begin with small steps rather than jumping into full conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. A simple exercise to [[developing_a_confident_mindset | build self-confidence]] involves [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | approaching women]] and asking for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

*   Ensure you are not wearing a watch and your cell phone is turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   Practice this by [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | approaching]] 10 women each day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.
*   After a few days, you should feel more at ease and notice a boost in your [[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

This exercise is particularly helpful a few minutes before you plan to engage in longer conversations, as it increases [[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]] and comfort when [[approaching_women_in_public | women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07">[01:07]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Setting

When first starting, it's advisable to [[choosing_the_right_setting_for_approaching_women | avoid nightclubs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19">[01:19]</a>. Nightclubs often lead to disappointment for beginners due to:
*   High competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32">[01:32]</a>.
*   Defensive attitudes from women who are frequently approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36">[01:36]</a>.
*   Loud music that makes conversation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40">[01:40]</a>.

Instead, [[choosing_the_right_setting_for_approaching_women | opt for calmer public spaces]] like parks, malls, or coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03">[01:03]</a>. Hobby classes such as yoga, salsa dancing, or aerobics are also excellent choices, as they often have a higher ratio of women to men, providing more opportunities to practice with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45">[01:45]</a>. Other suitable locations include restaurants, public libraries, or malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58">[01:58]</a>.

### The 5-Second Rule

Once you've identified a woman you'd like to talk to, make your approach within 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17">[02:17]</a>. Delaying the approach allows your brain to generate excuses, leading to self-doubt, increased nervousness, and potentially not approaching at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21">[02:21]</a>.

## Effective Approach Techniques

A common reason for rejection is an incorrect approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37">[02:37]</a>. Standard approaches—like staring, walking directly up to her, or using pickup lines—often fail because women are "programmed" to turn down such direct advances, often perceiving them as solely for casual encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a>.

The key to successful [[approaching_women_in_public | approaches]] is to make the woman comfortable in your presence before moving forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34">[03:34]</a>. If you appear to be trying too hard, she will sense an agenda and put up her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41">[03:41]</a>.

### How to Approach Physically

*   **Avoid approaching from the front:** If she sees you "charging" towards her, she will anticipate your approach and put up a wall of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03">[04:03]</a>.
*   **Never approach from behind:** This can startle her and instantly lead to avoidance, ruining your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18">[04:18]</a>.
*   **Always approach from the side:** This is the most effective method, as it doesn't scare her and prevents her from setting up her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41">[04:41]</a>.
    *   A good technique is to walk past her, then tilt your head in her direction and begin the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54">[04:54]</a>.
    *   Crucially, keep your chest facing away from her, talking over your shoulder. This non-threatening posture makes her feel more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00">[05:00]</a>.

### Starting a Conversation

Avoid direct approaches and act in a manner that demonstrates you are not trying to "hit on" her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16">[05:16]</a>. [[approaching_women with authenticity | Authenticity]] and naturalness are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48">[06:48]</a>.

*   **The "Cell Phone" Opener:**
    1.  Pretend to be on your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>.
    2.  Pass by her, look over your shoulder, and pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33">[05:33]</a>.
    3.  Hold the phone to your ear and say, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>.
    4.  Then, to her, say, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men. Is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41">[05:41]</a>.
    5.  She will likely disagree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45">[05:45]</a>. Hang up the phone and say, "I'm in a hurry, but my friend said never to trust anything a female says, half the time she would be lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48">[05:48]</a>.
    6.  She will disagree again. Respond with, "Yeah, I mean it can't apply to all females" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56">[05:56]</a>.
    7.  This opens the conversation and gains her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58">[05:58]</a>. Stating you are in a hurry lowers her defenses and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03">[06:03]</a>.

*   **Observational Openers (Situation-Dependent):**
    *   **In a restaurant:** Comment on what she is eating or drinking. "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52">[06:52]</a>. Follow up by saying you're new and need recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07">[07:07]</a>.
    *   **Neutral environment:** Comment on something she is wearing. "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on. What's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26">[07:26]</a>. This provides a natural segue to introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37">[07:37]</a>.

*   **Guessing or Assumption Openers:**
    *   Instead of asking "What do you do?" or "Where are you from?", make a guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45">[07:45]</a>.
    *   "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50">[07:50]</a>. If she asks "Why do you say that?", explain: "Well, you have the Californian look about you... like the way you're dressed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54">[07:54]</a>.
    *   This approach almost always prompts her to ask "Why do you say that?", opening the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13">[08:13]</a>.

### Engaging Beyond the Opener

Once the conversation is open, transition it to spark emotional attraction. This involves using techniques like the "qualifying technique," "listen like a therapist," [[body_language_and_selfconfidence_in_attracting_women | body language]], "push and pull," and "mystery" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56">[08:56]</a>.

*   **Talk to Her Friend More Than Your Target:** When approaching a group, most guys focus solely on their target, making their interest obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22">[09:22]</a>. Instead, spend more time talking to her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34">[09:34]</a>. This can make your target feel a bit jealous and curious about why she isn't receiving your full attention, making her work for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37">[09:37]</a>.

### Incorporating Physical Touch

Playful physical touch can double the impact of your words and help lower her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10">[10:10]</a>. If she allows you to touch her once, she's likely to permit further escalation into more intense physical interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55">[10:55]</a>.

*   **Nails:** Stare at her hands, grab her fingers, and say, "Oh, nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25">[10:25]</a>.
*   **Forehead:** Stare at her forehead, say, "You have something on your forehead," and then lightly clean it with your fingers, saying, "Okay, all clean now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32">[10:32]</a>.
*   **Hair:** Stare at her hair, comment on its color or style ("Wow, nice color" or "How did you get it curly like that? Is this real hair?"), and then touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39">[10:39]</a>.
*   **High Five:** Say, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team, give me a high five," and then give her a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45">[10:45]</a>.

## Getting Her Number

Once you've had a good conversation and successfully built attraction, getting her phone number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06">[11:06]</a>.

*   **The "Curiosity" Method:**
    1.  While telling an interesting story, casually say, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11">[11:11]</a>.
    2.  Continue your story without elaborating. If she asks, tell her you'll share after you finish the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:19">[11:19]</a>.
    3.  When the story ends, she will likely ask again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25">[11:25]</a>.
    4.  Check the time and say, "Oh, I'm running late, I have to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28">[11:28]</a>.
    5.  Hand her your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31">[11:31]</a>.
    *   This often works because she's interested in continuing the conversation. Handing her your phone also ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:38">[11:38]</a>.

*   **Providing a Motive:** If you don't have a story, create another motive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16">[12:16]</a>.
    *   "My friends are having this party on Saturday, it's one of the coolest events which happens only once a year. I have free passes, you should come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25">[12:25]</a>.
    *   Then, hand her your phone: "Here, punch in your number, I'll let you know the timings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33">[12:33]</a>.
    *   Randomly asking for a number ("Can I have your phone number?") often leads to rejection or a forgettable interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38">[12:38]</a>.

*   **Handling Refusal or Incorrect Numbers:**
    *   If she gives a wrong number and you confirm it, say, "Oh, playing, aren't we?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47">[11:47]</a>. If she apologizes and offers to correct it, say, "No, never mind, I don't want it. It was great meeting you," and walk off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54">[11:54]</a>.
    *   If she completely refuses to give her number, it indicates you haven't built enough attraction. Say, "Come on, giddy up, I don't have much time here." If she still refuses, offer a friendly goodbye and walk away immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58">[11:58]</a>.

Immediately after getting her phone number, exit the venue to avoid an awkward bump-in that could reverse the attraction you've built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52">[12:52]</a>.

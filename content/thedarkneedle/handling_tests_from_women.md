When interacting with [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | high quality women]], or any women, men can expect to be [[dealing_with_tests_in_interactions | tested]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These tests serve as a way for women to gauge a man's [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | confidence]] and see if he can be thrown off balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

## Why Women Test Men

Women conduct these tests to assess a man's inner strength and composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **Passing the test:** If a man shows he "couldn't care less" and remains unfazed, his [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] for the woman grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
*   **Failing the test:** If a man becomes defensive, insecure, or tries to justify himself, her [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] will fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

## Common Forms of Tests

Tests typically manifest as:
*   Snide remarks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>
*   Tricky questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>
*   Unreasonable requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>

**Examples of tests:**
*   "I bet you use that line on all the girls." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
*   "How many women have you slept with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>
*   "Buy me a drink." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

## How to Pass Tests: Agree and Amplify

The easiest method to pass these tests is to "agree and amplify" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This means agreeing with what she says and taking it to an exaggerated, almost absurd level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

**Examples of Agree and Amplify:**

*   **Test:** "I bet you use that line on all the girls." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
    *   **Response:** "Yeah, I wake up every morning surrounded by women. Is that good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>

*   **Test:** "How many women have you slept with?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   **Response:** "Today? Not that many." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

*   **Test:** "Buy me a drink." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>
    *   **Response:** "Sure, would you like my ATM pin too?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>

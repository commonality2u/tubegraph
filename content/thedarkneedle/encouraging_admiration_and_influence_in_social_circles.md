Possessing strong [[improving_social_skills_as_a_practice | social skills]] is crucial for success in life, accounting for 85% of one's achievements, as evidenced by CEOs, company executives, and world leaders who all share this common ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## The Human Instinct: A Hunger for Value

At the core of all social interactions lies a deeply ingrained human instinct: a "hunger for value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. People desire to feel valuable in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Satisfying this instinct correctly can win people over and make them willing to act on your behalf <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!example] The Math Tutor's Student
> The speaker recounts an experience tutoring a "slow" student. By telling him, "You are slow to understand and you're stupid but you have one great thing you are hardworking," and predicting his future success, the student was motivated to study harder than ever before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. His motivation stemmed from a desire to please the tutor, prove he deserved the praise, and impress him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This constituted a form of [[using_indirect_praise_to_influence_and_manipulate | positive manipulation]] that fed the student's hunger for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Strategies to Make Others Feel Valued

To become well-loved in your social circle, it's essential to learn the correct way to feed this "value instinct" in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### The Golden Rule of Influence
If you want to influence someone, make them feel like *they* are the one who left an impression and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of trying to show how amazing you are, show them *they* are amazing and remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Focused Conversation
Make the conversation revolve around the other person and focus on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Let them talk about themselves**: When they share an experience, keep the focus on them by asking questions like "what did you do about it?" or "how did it go?" rather than shifting to your own similar experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Listen actively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Redirect general topics**: Take a general topic (e.g., the weather) and redirect it to elicit their personal opinions or preferences (e.g., "what do you like more, rain or sunshine?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   By doing this, you give them value, satisfy their instinct, and make them feel they have influenced you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### The Power of Non-Proving Behavior
Allow the other person to try to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. When someone starts trying to gain your admiration, it means you've already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This applies to both general interactions and with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Achieve this by not trying to prove anything to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

*   **Ignoring Minor Interruptions**: If someone interrupts you or changes the subject occasionally, let them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Don't insist on returning to your previous topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This shows you don't need to prove yourself, demonstrating [[confidence_in_social_interactions | strength]] and increasing your value in their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Directness with Constant Interruptions**: If someone constantly interrupts you, you should not allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. Calmly and directly say, "Why don't you let me finish what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. As a man, society expects clear and direct expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If they continue, it's acceptable to stop engaging with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Recognizing Their Presence as a Person
Value people for who they are, not for what they have or do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Avoid interrogating about status**: Refrain from asking questions about their job, education, or income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Don't give unsolicited advice**: Do not lecture people or tell them they need to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Advice should only be given when asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Accept them as they are, with their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Never place yourself above others**: Don't put yourself in a higher position by giving unsolicited advice or trying to fix their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid correcting trivial facts**: If someone states something incorrect that doesn't significantly impact the conversation, don't correct them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. It's a bad habit to constantly correct others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Eliciting Admiration from Others

Give the other person the opportunity to try and earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

*   **Ask for their opinion**: People often focus on expressing their own opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Learn to ask for others' opinions on topics and listen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Ask for their suggestions**: Listen when people want to offer suggestions or advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   **Never treat anyone as if they don't understand**: Avoid looking down on anyone, even if they are less educated or younger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. Treat them as your equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
    *   **Handle suggestions respectfully**: If someone offers a suggestion, listen to them and don't outright reject it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. If the idea isn't suitable, you can say, "That seems like a good idea, but I need to think about it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## Social Skills as a Practice

The advice "be yourself" is often counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Just as one might quit smoking or go to the gym to change, one's way of communicating is a skill that needs [[improving_social_skills_as_a_practice | practice and improvement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

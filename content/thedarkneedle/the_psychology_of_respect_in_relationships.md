Understanding respect in romantic contexts is crucial, as the phrase "if a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" holds true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the respect a woman should have for a partner differs from the ordinary respect found in other relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The type of respect that fosters attraction and love is distinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Types of Respect in Relationships

There are two primary types of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>: This is the kind of respect one might feel for a kind, elderly man or for friends, including those in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Traditional advice like setting boundaries often only leads to this type of respect, keeping a man in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
2.  **Emperor-like Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>: This is the respect felt for a powerful, inspiring, and impressive figure, like a Roman Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Men who receive this type of respect are the ones women fantasize about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. The respect a woman should have for you in a romantic context is "Emperor-like respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Respect generally starts at zero and gradually builds over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Attractive respect occurs when a woman *wants* to respect you, rather than when you are trying to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Components of Attractive Respect

This "Emperor-like respect" is comprised of two core elements: power and a subtle form of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The fear mentioned is a subtle type that she actually enjoys and does not mean she will be afraid of you in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

#### Power

Having power in a relationship means your life remains the same after meeting a woman as it was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. While you can try new things, it should be for yourself, not because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Women often test men by trying to make them change, especially early in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This might involve critiquing your style, haircut, habits, or even friends and job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Conceding to these demands leads to a loss of power and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Your opinions should also remain unchanged by her influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. When she tries to make you change, calmly say "no" rather than arguing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Actions speak louder than words; avoid justifying or debating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

Sacrificing for a woman, as seen in movies, is ineffective and can land you in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Your happiness and enjoyment should not be given up for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. A girl should never be the reason for your change; this is the first manifestation of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

###### Avoiding Unnecessary Apologies

A common mistake is apologizing without reason or for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If you didn't do anything wrong, do not apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Before apologizing, consider if you genuinely made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Here's how to navigate apologies in different situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>:

*   **You did nothing wrong but she's upset**: Do not apologize. Instead, tease her playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   **You made a small mistake (e.g., forgetting a minor gift in an established relationship)**: Apologize briefly by saying "sorry," then give her space. Do not chase her begging for forgiveness; let her come back naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **You made a very big, unforgivable mistake (e.g., cheating)**: It is acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, such as buying a gift or visiting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

###### Handling Her Mistakes

When she is at fault, your reactions also contribute to maintaining power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>:

*   **Small transgression (e.g., something she said)**: Do not show any reaction, anger, or upset. Do not show that you care or engage in drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Minor mistake (e.g., canceling a date last minute)**: Do not get angry, but hold her accountable. For example, if she cancels a date, say something like, "You're messing up your chances with me," and hang up. If she calls back to apologize, you can make a serious demand, like writing an apology letter. If she refuses, end the conversation and do not contact her until she contacts you first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Consequences are necessary when she makes a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: Do not get angry, but end the relationship. Forgiving her in such a situation will lead to a permanent loss of respect, and she may only stay to exploit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

###### Maintaining Composure

Never allow a woman to make you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. If her actions can elicit such reactions, it indicates she controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Even if she says nasty things, do not react with anger or lose your cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Often, she may be testing you to see your reaction to extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Reacting predictably means failing the test, losing power, and losing her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

#### Fear

The second element of attractive respect is a type of fear she enjoys and wants to feel in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This concept is best understood through the principle: [[investment_dynamics_and_their_impact_on_attraction_and_respect | Investment]] = Attraction = Respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.

Many men mistakenly believe that *their* investment in a woman (e.g., expensive dates, luxury cars) is what matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, which often leads them to the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The crucial lesson is that it's *her* investment in you that counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The more you invest in her, the more attached *you* become, and the more she occupies *your* thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, if she isn't investing in you, her feelings remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

To foster attraction and desire, you need to reverse this dynamic: the more she invests in you, the more attracted she will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. You should still invest, but only enough to make her comfortable investing in you, then allow her to take the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

As she starts to invest, her fear of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Humans naturally fear losing something they have invested heavily in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For example, a piggy bank with $20 holds little worry, but after months of daily contributions, reaching $3,000, the fear of losing it significantly increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Similarly, the more a woman invests her time, effort, and emotions in you, the more she fears losing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

This fear is the second key component of "Emperor-like respect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. When both power and this subtle fear are present, a woman will not dare to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

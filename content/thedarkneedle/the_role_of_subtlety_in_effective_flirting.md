When it comes to flirting, men generally fall into [[types_of_flirting_and_male_archetypes | three types]]: those who don't know how to flirt and end up in the friend zone, those who come off as awkward due to their lack of flirting skills, and those who know how to flirt well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Flirting is a crucial part of seduction because it gets a woman thinking about you in a romantic context and clarifies your sexual intent, distinguishing you from just a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Effective flirting also allows you to [[psychological_strategies_to_enhance_attraction | influence the mind]] of the person you're flirting with, so they perceive you as a high-value individual, not merely someone chasing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Common Flirting Mistakes

Most guys struggle with flirting due to [[common_flirting_mistakes_and_how_to_avoid_them | common mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Being Too Obvious
A frequent error is being overly obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This approach kills mystery and excitement, as intrigue is what makes interactions fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

> **Example of Obvious Flirting**
> Girl: "I love sports bras."
> Guy: "I bet you'd look amazing in a sports bra." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>

Direct physical compliments are generally ill-advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. They can make you appear as though you've never been with an attractive woman and eliminate any mystery about your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### The "Anti-Slut Defense" and Plausible Deniability
Being too direct sexually can hinder a woman's ability to absolve herself of perceived promiscuity, known as her "anti-slut defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Women are socialized to fear being seen as sexually promiscuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Therefore, when you are too direct, many women will create an excuse or disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

Instead, offer her a way to rationalize potential sexual encounters as something that "just happened," providing her with plausible deniability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

> **Example of Plausible Deniability**
> Guy: "I've got this awesome pool table at my place. We'll go play a round." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
> This allows her to tell herself she's going back to your place for fun, rather than explicitly for sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Non-Sexual Banter
Many men mistakenly use the same non-sexual banter they'd use with male friends when flirting with women, lacking any sexual undertones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. Playing it safe and avoiding bolder moves leads to interactions devoid of sexual tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Techniques for Subtle Flirting

To become an irresistible flirt, the key is subtlety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This means making your flirting indirect and less blunt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

### Being Indirect
Indirect flirting works through implication rather than direct statements, creating more mystery and intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

> **Example of Indirect Flirting**
> Girl: "I love sports bras."
> Guy: "Really? Well, believe it or not, I love girls who love sports bras." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>

This approach implies attraction without revealing all your cards, which is far more exciting for women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. It generates excitement through mystery and projects you as a high-value individual, unlike direct, clumsy flirting that can make you seem desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Passing Her Tests
High-quality women often [[handling_tests_from_women_during_flirting | test you]] to gauge your confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. If you remain unfazed, you pass the test, and her attraction grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. These tests usually manifest as snide remarks or tricky questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. The easiest method to pass is to "agree and amplify" â€“ agree with her statement and take it to an exaggerated, absurd level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

> **Example of Agreeing and Amplifying**
> Girl: "I bet you use that line on all the girls."
> Guy: "Yeah, I wake up every morning surrounded by women. Is that good?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>

### Acting Like the Prize
Flip the traditional "boys chase girls" dynamic by subtly implying that *she* is chasing *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Frame the conversation as if she is the pursuer, playfully twisting her words and actions to suggest she's trying to seduce you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

> **Examples of Acting Like the Prize**
> Girl: "I love sports bras."
> Guy: "Don't try to make me think of you in a sports bra." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
> Girl: "Want to grab another drink?"
> Guy: "Oh, I see how it is, trying to get me drunk so you can take advantage of me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

### Push-Pull Flirting
[[psychology_of_pushpull_dynamics_in_flirting | Push-pull flirting]] involves a [[effectiveness_of_playful_interaction_with_women | playful mix]] of pushing a woman away and pulling her back in, both physically and verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This contradiction creates excitement and keeps her engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

> **Examples of Push-Pull**
> Guy: "You're too cute for me to handle. Shoo!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
> Guy: "You're awesome, you're like my little sister." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>

This dynamic creates intrigue and excitement, making the woman more invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>. It also demonstrates that you are a high-value individual, as easily obtained things are often esteemed lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### Pretending It's Her Fault
A good starting point for subtle flirting is to playfully accuse her of trying to seduce you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

> **Example**
> If she talks about her house or asks for help with home electronics, ask her: "Are you already trying to bring me to your place? I'm not surprised!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>
> Women generally enjoy this kind of teasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Using Sexual Allusions
Instead of directly stating you're a good lover, use sexual allusions to imply it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

> **Example**
> If you make a cocktail at your place and she says, "Wow, you're good at that," make eye contact and say, "I'm good at many things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>
> This implies more, and she will want to know <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### Encouraging Her to "Use" You
Since women often accuse men of using them for sex, reverse the roles playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

> **Example**
> After doing something for her, say: "So you're already using me? I can already see that soon you'll be using me for other things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
> This role reversal is often found hilarious and is an innocent, non-offensive way to bring sex into the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

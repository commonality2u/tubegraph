Many men struggle with finding the right woman because they fail to identify what they truly desire in a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Simply wanting a "great woman" without defining what that means leads to accepting whatever is available, rather than what is genuinely suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A woman is attracted to a man who knows exactly what he wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## The Importance of Specificity

Instead of vague descriptors like "cool, hot, fun," you need a detailed list of qualities for your ideal partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Consider specific questions to define her:
*   Who is she exactly? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>
*   What does she believe in? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>
*   How does she treat you on your worst day? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>
*   What truly lights you up – deep down, in your gut, brain, and soul? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>

It's crucial to write these down immediately, not someday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Without a clear definition of "great," your mind has no framework, leading you to chase chemistry over compatibility and ultimately, to settle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

### The Dangers of Settling
Settling is described as "slow motion self-sabotage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Phrases like "she's good enough" often mean "she's familiar," and "it's fine" usually means "it's just not painful yet" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This indicates that you're not truly in love, but rather afraid to be alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Setting Your Standards
When you define your standards, everything changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. You cease chasing women who don't align with your vision and stop "begging for crumbs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This shift in energy, acting like a man with standards, attracts a different kind of woman – one who matches and truly sees you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. You won't attract this ideal partner until you have defined her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

Many men operate from past heartbreaks or rejections, turning dating into "trauma management" rather than a pursuit of something real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. To achieve genuine connection, you must become "ruthlessly specific" about what you seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

### Your Personal Blueprint
Let your specific definition become your filter, compass, and blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Then, focus on building yourself into the man who can genuinely hold that ideal relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When you meet her, it will feel like an arrival, not mere luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Ask yourself:
*   What do I crave in a woman, not what I *should* want? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>
*   What kind of love would truly nourish me? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>
*   What is truly *mine*? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>

Write it down, own it, and live by it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Setting High Expectations
Always [[identifying_unrealistic_dating_expectations | set high expectations]] for yourself and put a high price on your own value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. High expectations ensure you won't allow anyone to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Instead, you'll find others working for your attention, rather than the reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It is vital to never let a woman into your life who does not meet your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Keeping her on her toes to meet your standards, and punishing bad behavior without exception, helps maintain attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This ensures attraction never dies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

When it comes to relationships, particularly those between men and women, the way attention is given or withheld plays a crucial psychological role. The concept of being "half bad, half nice" (referred to as a "gentleman" for simplicity) is presented as an optimal approach for fostering deep attraction and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. This contrasts with being either a "nice guy" (often relegated to the friend zone) or a "bad boy" (experiencing frequent breakups) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Human Nature and Perception

Our brains naturally pay attention to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>. For example, when presented with a white background with a black dot, the focus is on the black dot, ignoring the vast whiteness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. Conversely, a white dot on a black background draws attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. This principle applies to social relationships:

*   **The "Nice Guy" Analogy**: Someone who is always kind and helpful (like a white background) will have any single mistake or refusal (a black dot) stand out prominently in others' minds, leading to resentment and a disregard for past good deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **The "Half Bad Half Nice" Analogy**: A person who is not naturally kind but occasionally performs a good deed (like a black background with a white spot) will be praised and seen as a great person, despite typically being unpleasant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

True [[the_psychology_of_respect_in_relationships | respect]] is not gained by constantly serving others or being perpetually kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. Instead, it is more effective to be primarily neutral or indifferent, with occasional acts of kindness standing out as exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This strategy is key to [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | understanding women's psychology and attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

## The Gentleman's Approach to Attention

When a man is not consistently "nice" but behaves normally or even indifferently, a woman perceives him as a high-value individual. His lack of constant niceness is interpreted as confidence and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. When such a man *does* perform a kind gesture, it becomes an exception that she focuses on intently, remembering it for an extended period, which increases her [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This approach directly contributes to [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | maintaining attraction]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

A widespread misconception is that women love abundant attention. This is inaccurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. For long-term, healthy relationships, a strategic approach to attention is necessary: it should not be given all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Balance of Attention

There must be a balance between giving and withholding attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. The rule is: every time attention is given, it should be stopped afterward to prevent it from losing its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. For instance, after a nice dinner, avoid texting her that night or asking if she got home safely; simply "disappear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. This is part of [[psychological_strategies_to_enhance_attraction | psychological strategies to enhance attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

### Giving Attention Based on Emotional Dynamics

The decision to give attention depends on the type of emotions involved and their cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

1.  **Woman feels negative emotions because of you**: If you are the cause of her negative feelings (e.g., jealousy from talking to another woman, anger from your mistake), you *should* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
2.  **You feel negative emotions because of her**: If her actions cause you negative emotions (e.g., she talks to another man, posts a photo you dislike), you *must not* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Instead, ignore the situation completely without showing anger or being affected. If she messages you, reply normally but without extra attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Showing jealousy or fear of loss through excessive compliments is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Woman feels positive emotions because of you**: If she is happy due to your actions (e.g., taking her to a nice place), you *should not* give her too much attention afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>. Remember the rule of balance: do not give continuous attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
4.  **You feel positive emotions because of her**: If she does something that pleases *you* (e.g., wears an attractive outfit, buys a gift), you *should* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
5.  **Woman feels emotions not caused by you**: If her emotions (positive or negative) are due to external factors (e.g., work problems, family issues), you *should remain neutral* and *not* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Immediately buying flowers or trying to cheer her up is a mistake, as it can place you in the "therapy zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. If she is your girlfriend, listen and talk kindly, but avoid excessive attention or overdoing help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Women experience a wide range of emotions daily, and constantly chasing her when she feels down is unrealistic and leads to dealing with an emotionally drained woman needing constant support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

By applying this pattern, a man will mostly remain neutral, only occasionally giving attention. This balance makes her more attracted to him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. This strategic use of attention is a key component of [[understanding_behavior_and_its_impact_on_attention_from_women | understanding behavior and its impact on attention from women]] and [[psychology_of_attracting_women | psychology of attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Dealing with Requests

The second fundamental point in dealing with women is managing requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>. Requests can be either tests of strength/manipulability or genuine desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. This relates to [[psychology_of_pushpull_dynamics_in_flirting | push-pull dynamics in flirting]] and [[mindset_and_selfesteem_in_relationships | mindset and self-esteem in relationships]].

### Direct Orders

When a request comes as a direct order (e.g., "Hold this for me," "Give me a kiss on the cheek"), especially in early interactions, women are often testing if you are accustomed to attractive women and if you will immediately obey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

*   **Refuse Inconvenient/Nonsensical Orders**: If the request inconveniences you or makes no sense (e.g., "Go buy me something"), you must refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>.
*   **Accept on Your Own Terms**: If the request doesn't bother you but is still a direct order (e.g., "Take our picture"), do not accept directly. Instead, accept on your own terms, taking control by adding conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. For example, if asked to take a picture, respond with, "Okay, but I want you to give me your best silly sexy gangster face, ready, go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. This subtly shifts the power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

### Indirect Expressions of Feelings

Women often express desires indirectly, such as saying "I love the beach" instead of "I want to go to the beach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>. To avoid being perceived as a "nice guy" who immediately fulfills every wish, the answer is **delaying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

*   **Delay Gratification**: If she mentions she loves burritos, don't immediately take her for one. Instead, surprise her with a burrito a few weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   **Benefits of Delaying**: Delaying shows thoughtfulness (you listened) without appearing overly eager or submissive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. It also makes you unpredictable, which women appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Show Strength**: Note what she likes, but act on it at unexpected moments. Be kind but firm, making it clear that you don't respond to whining or demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Over time, she learns she receives what she wants on *your* terms, not hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.

In summary, indirect requests should always be handled by delaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. This approach allows a man to be nice without losing his masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

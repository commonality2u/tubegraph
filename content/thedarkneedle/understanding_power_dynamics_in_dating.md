Establishing and maintaining control over dating dynamics can be approached through a three-step plan designed to shift a woman's emotional frame and foster engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This approach aims to guide the interaction by influencing a woman's perception of herself and the relationship, ultimately leading her to invest emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## Three-Step Plan to Influence Dating Dynamics

### Step 1: Establishing Emotional Control with "You're Trouble"

The first step involves making a woman [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | surrender to your emotional frame]] using a technique labeled "You're trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This phrase labels her in a way that aims to [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | take away her power]], contrasting with the typical male subconscious goal of being liked, which often grants women control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Most men approach women trying to appear safe and friendly, which women are accustomed to and use to their advantage to control the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The phrase "You're trouble," delivered calmly and confidently, without joking or "puppy eyes," aims to put her on the defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It subtly implies she is dangerous and someone to be careful with, shifting the dynamic from the man hoping she likes him to her needing to prove herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This challenges her usual patterns, as women deep down crave men who see through their games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Saying "I see your game and I'm not playing it" disarms her, interrupting her social autopilot and forcing her to react authentically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The open-ended nature of "You're trouble" leaves her brain spinning, creating a "psychological itch" to understand what you mean and how you see her, as she tries to regain control of the frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. If she begins defending herself or trying to shape your perception, she has lost the frame and is now doing the chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Her attention becomes locked on your opinion of her, shifting the [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | power dynamic]] into your emotional frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Application of "You're Trouble"

This technique should be applied within the first 5 to 10 minutes of a conversation, before she can establish a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Use it when she:
*   Flirts too easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>
*   Smiles like she's done it many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>
*   Asks too many questions too fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>
*   Acts innocent in a performative way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>

Deliver it with a calm smirk, saying, "You're trouble. I can already tell," then remain silent without laughing or explaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. It can also serve as a pattern break when she expects a compliment, such as in response to a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This forces her to adjust in real-time, revealing her authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

If she pushes back (e.g., "No, I'm not"), it indicates your words pierced her surface, and her defense is an emotional investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. If she plays along (e.g., "Maybe I am"), you've given her a new identity that will shape her behavior, keeping you in control of the emotional rhythm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Reuse the phrase later when she reveals something unhinged, emotional, or indicative of her real nature, reinforcing the pattern you've identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Eventually, she may internalize the label, jokingly calling herself "trouble," signaling her emotional [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | surrender to your frame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Step 2: Creating Craving and Uncertainty with "I Like This, Whatever This Is"

Once the woman starts to chase, the second step is to maintain that chase by creating craving using the phrase "I like this, whatever this is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This technique is used when she begins to open up, lean in, or show her depth and uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

By saying "I like this," you emotionally reward her for her vulnerability, but by adding "whatever this is," you withhold full definition, keeping her chasing clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This implies something special is happening without allowing her to fully grasp it, creating emotional tension instead of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This mix of warmth and confusion aims to create obsession, as her brain becomes stuck in a loop, questioning the nature of your connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. This delivers emotional weight without clear structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This [[psychology_of_pushpull_dynamics_in_flirting | push-pull dynamic]] can lead her to feel an addiction to the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

### Application of "I Like This, Whatever This Is"

This line must be earned and delivered at the sweet spot when emotional tension has built, before it becomes romantic, but undeniably charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. It should be said in a moment of natural intimacy, such as after shared laughter or when she is feeling comfortable and physically closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

*   **Example 1:** After a laugh and brief silence, glance at her, smirk, and casually say, "I like this, whatever this is," then immediately look away or change the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Example 2:** After she shares something vulnerable, pause, look at her, and say, "You know, I like this, whatever this is," then go quiet and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The delivery is crucial: it should seem to slip out, as if you were surprised by your own honesty but too composed to make a big deal of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The goal is to make her feel something, then pull away before she gets emotional closure, creating a warm-and-cold sensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. The energy should convey "Yeah, I felt something, but I'm not going to make a big deal out of it. It is what it is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This subtle detachment makes the line powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Her brain will loop, trying to make sense of the undefined moment, causing her to replay it later and potentially bring it up to friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. This uncertainty aims to make her want to escape it, positioning you as the only one who can resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### Step 3: Solidifying the Relationship Role with "You Already Act Like My Girl Sometimes"

The final step is to turn her confusion into ownership using the phrase, "You already act like my girl sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This assigns her the girlfriend role, but not fully, creating further tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. You imply she is already behaving like someone emotionally attached without giving her the title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. This exposes behavior she may not have intended to admit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

Her mind then races, questioning if she is indeed acting that way, potentially entering a mild emotional spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. If she pushes back, she creates internal tension by denying a truth she feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. If she agrees, even jokingly, she admits to being attached and steps into the frame you've provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. You are not asking her to be your girlfriend but implying she has naturally slipped into that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This prompts her to scan her past behavior, leading her to feel like she's just being herself when she plays into the role, not realizing you influenced her perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Application of "You Already Act Like My Girl Sometimes"

This line should be delivered after she exhibits some form of emotional behavior resembling girlfriend behavior, such as:
*   Getting annoyed if you don't reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>
*   Doing something nurturing or domestic (e.g., folding your shirt, bringing food, giving advice) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

Deliver it calmly, like an observation, with a slight smirk but not silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Drop it into the conversation without making it seem deep, then change the subject immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. The tone should never be needy or overtly seeking a girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. It's a tease, but one based on a truth she cannot deny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. When she starts defending, joking, or playing into it, it indicates the frame has landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Once she starts using terms like "we" or "already" regarding your connection, she is no longer deciding to be with you, but waiting for you to formalize the label she has accepted in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

By unbalancing her ego with the first phrase, confusing her emotions and creating craving with the second, and giving her the illusion of choice with the third, this three-step plan aims to lead a woman into a desired relationship dynamic without direct chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

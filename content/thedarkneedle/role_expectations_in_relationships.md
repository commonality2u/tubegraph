Attraction is not always logical, and women are often naturally drawn to traits associated with older men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. A young man who possesses these traits can be more attractive than both other young men and older men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This article explores key characteristics of an "old guy" personality that can lead to intense attraction, focusing on [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships]] and [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships]].

## Traits of an "Older Guy" Personality

### 1. Obsession with a Specific Passion

Older men often possess a deep obsession with a specific passion or a clearly defined hobby, which is not commonly found in young men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This isn't just about having *any* passion, but a specific *type* of passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

#### True Passion vs. Goal-Oriented Hobbies

A young man's hobby might be driven by goals like fame or money, for example, running a YouTube channel to "become famous, to make money and to achieve my dreams" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. In contrast, true passion is about enjoying the activity purely for its own sake, without caring about the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

#### Production and Creativity

The passion that attracts women stems from "production and creativity," rather than mere "consumption" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Consumption** includes activities like playing video games, watching movies, or eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Production and creativity** involve creating something, requiring effort and hard work, but bringing deep enjoyment. Examples include programming games, gardening, cooking, building a strong physique, hiking, martial arts, painting, pottery, or metalworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. These "difficult hobbies" that require effort are seen as attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

#### How to Display This Trait

To effectively showcase this passion and make a woman feel attracted, consider two methods:

1.  **Prioritize Your Hobby Over Her**: Make your hobby a non-negotiable part of your schedule. For instance, if you have a scheduled workout or hiking trip, stick to it even if it means declining a spontaneous invitation from your partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Even if she tries to persuade you to stay or you don't feel like going, you "must force yourself to go and not stay with her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. This demonstrates your commitment to your pursuits.
2.  **Talk About Your Passion with Deep Emotion**: When discussing your hobby, don't just state what you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Express the intense emotions and satisfaction you derive from it, such as the feeling of lifting heavier weights, the "love for the pain" in your muscles, or the satisfaction of reaching a mountain peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

### 2. Confidence in Decisions

An older man is "completely confident in his decisions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Through experience, he develops firm convictions and beliefs that are difficult to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. When he makes a decision, it is firm, and "no woman can change his mind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

#### How to Display This Trait

To show this certainty, you must "stick to your guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Even if your partner disagrees, pleads, or debates, you must "hold your ground if you are completely convinced that your decision is the best one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

For example, when considering moving to a new apartment, one man stood firm on his financial priorities despite his girlfriend's desire for an upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. He prioritized financial stability and long-term goals over temporary comfort, explaining that "financial stability and long-term goals matter more than a slightly newer apartment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. She later admitted respecting him more for his long-term thinking, which strengthened her trust in his rational decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

This paradox suggests that saying "no" to a woman and standing your ground, even on small matters, can make you more attractive to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### 3. Avoiding the "Child" Role

A crucial aspect of an older man's dynamic is that a woman "will never treat an older man as if he were her child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. In a relationship, the possibilities are that she either treats you "like her little child or you take on the role of a father figure to her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. It is essential to "never allow a woman to treat you like a little child" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

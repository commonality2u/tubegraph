If you consistently find yourself ignored by women, or if a specific girl you like makes you chase her without acknowledgement, it indicates a significant problem in your life that isn't solved by finances or physical appearance alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even becoming a millionaire won't solve this if your fundamental approach is flawed, as it will only attract those who wish to exploit you financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The core issue lies in your behavior and the way you interact with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. To solve this, you need to change your approach, not remain as you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The Problem: Neediness and Effort

When you like a girl and want her to like you back, you tend to make an effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This effort involves stepping out of your natural self, such as adjusting your posture, speaking differently, or trying to appear special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This "effort" signals "need" – similar to making an effort to get food when you are hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

Neediness is considered the number one killer of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. It's not about explicitly stating "I need you," but rather a feeling she senses when you make an effort solely to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This neediness is the primary reason women begin to ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

To stop being ignored, you must avoid being needy, which means stopping the effort to impress, and instead, remaining in your natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The moment a girl perceives you've stepped out of your natural self, she will automatically start ignoring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is why girls you don't even like often end up liking you – because you are simply being yourself around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Avoiding Manipulative Tactics
Forget online "nonsense" like not replying to her, blocking her, or being late for dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. While these manipulative tactics might sometimes work, they are not a genuine solution and are often noticed by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## How to Make Her Feel You Don't Need Her

To make a girl feel that you don't need her and to stay natural around her, adopt the following behaviors and rules:

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion
Focus on enjoying your time without needing her approval or adhering to society's standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

*   **Playful Interaction**: Engage in playful, lighthearted actions you'd normally do with a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
    *   **Examples**: Lightly tapping her on the head with a plastic bottle and saying "Shh" in a playful way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This shows you don't care what she thinks and are being yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
    *   **"Good Girl"**: If she does a small favor, pat her on the head and say "Good girl" as if she were a little kid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Teasing**: If she shares a setback (e.g., a low exam score, falling down), laugh and playfully tease her, rather than immediately showing concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This indicates you're enjoying the moment without needing her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
        *   *Caution*: This should be done in situations where she is clearly okay with joking, not in serious or genuinely hurtful circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   **Maintain Your Habits**: If you smoke and she complains, don't immediately change your behavior or move away. Simply state you'll finish your current cigarette and continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Let her adjust her distance if she is uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
*   **Detachment from Outcome**: Your focus should be on enjoying your time, detached from the outcome of whether she approves of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself
Don't make special efforts or change your lifestyle just to impress her.

*   **Date Locations**: For dates, especially early ones, choose places you would go with a friend, rather than expensive or fancy restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Some of the best dates can be in parks or free places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   **Familiarity**: Take her to a place where people know you (e.g., a regular cafe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This signals that she's an addition to your existing life, not the reason you've changed it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Appearance**: Avoid dressing in an extravagant or overly flashy way as if attending a wedding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Wear something normal, simple, and comfortable, just as you would for a casual outing with a sibling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This shows you're relaxed and not trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Acknowledge Flaws**: If she criticizes your abilities or points out a flaw, don't get defensive or try to prove her wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Instead, laugh, acknowledge it, and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Don't be ashamed of your flaws or force yourself to do something you're incapable of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Don't Meet Her Standards**: If she states preferences for certain types of guys (e.g., "I like guys who go to the gym"), don't try to meet those standards or fall into the trap of chasing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Instead, flip the situation into a joke, like "You've got great taste" or "Yeah, I like guys like that, too," and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### 3. Never Compete Over Her
Avoid putting yourself in situations where you are vying for a girl's attention against other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Avoid One-Upmanship**: When in a group with both men and women, avoid trying to tell the best joke, look the strongest, or tell the most exciting story to gain a girl's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Competing shows neediness and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.
*   **Stay Natural**: Remain calm and natural, as if there are no girls present, and simply enjoy the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Elevate Other Men**: One of the strongest ways to impress girls is to elevate the value of other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Appreciate Others**: If someone tells a joke, laugh genuinely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If they share an impressive story, don't try to one-up them; instead, clap, laugh, and highlight their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Women notice when a man doesn't compete and instead acts confident and self-assured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **No Jealousy**: If you see a girl you like with another guy, don't ask about him or try to get details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.
    *   **Introduce to Friends**: If you have a friend who is better looking than you, introduce him to the girl you're dating or in a relationship with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This demonstrates high [[Honesty and confidence in social interactions | confidence]] and lack of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### 4. Body Language
Your body language should naturally reflect comfort, not manufactured poses.

*   **Comfort Over Rules**: Forget online advice about specific postures for sitting or walking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Simply be comfortable. If you want to put your hands in your pockets, or stretch out and lean back, do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Natural Movement**: Walk and move in a way that feels comfortable to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. A girl's mind will pick up on your genuine comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Always remember, you don't need the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. While you may like her, you should not make an effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. By applying these behaviors, she will feel that you are someone who doesn't need her, and you will no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>, as you haven't given her the chance to ignore you in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

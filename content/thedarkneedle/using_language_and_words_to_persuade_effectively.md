To convince someone to adopt your perspective or to encourage them to act as you wish, there are two key steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. First, you must understand their mindset, and second, you need to communicate in a way that influences their thoughts by selecting the appropriate words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This approach can also be applied when trying to meet, attract, or win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Building Connection through Non-Verbal Communication

The quickest way to understand someone's inner thoughts is by establishing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Creating a connection involves deliberately matching with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, as it's easier to persuade someone you have a bond with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Your brain constantly processes non-verbal information, such as facial expressions and body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The human body, composed of the head, body, and feet, sends these non-verbal signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### The Body-Mood Link

A connection is formed based on the principle that your body's actions influence your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. By observing others' body movements and facial expressions, you can discern their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. If you then mirror their actions, you may begin to experience similar emotions, demonstrating the link between body and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Consider this exercise:
*   Walk with your head up, looking at the skyline, and smile, even if the smile isn't genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Then, walk with your head down, looking at the ground, slowing your pace, putting your hands in your pockets, and dragging your feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   Notice the shift in your mood between the two postures, confirming that posture alone can affect emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This indicates that copying someone's posture can help you understand their feelings and enter their mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

### Adjusting Your Mood to Match Others

To connect with someone, adjust your mood to match theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. After observing their posture, identify their mood (e.g., happy, sad, curious) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

**Steps to Influence Someone's Mood:**
1.  **Choose a person to observe**: Start with someone you don't have a serious connection with, like a cashier or a neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This is for practice, though it can eventually be applied to anyone, including a "beautiful girl" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  **Read the person**: Mirror their posture and define their mood (e.g., happy, angry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Immerse yourself in that mood**: Use inner dialogue, aligning your thoughts with the desired mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Recall past memories when you felt that way, experiencing the images, feelings, and sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
4.  **Approach and speak**: Maintain the mood while speaking normally until you are both on the same emotional wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Continue until a connection is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
5.  **Shift the mood**: Once connected, gradually change your gestures, posture, and smile to shift your own mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Observe the other person's mood changing along with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This process allows you to [[steps_to_influence_someones_behavior | influence another person]] at a subconscious level using nonverbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

**Important Note**: There is a significant difference between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Adapt to others' movements subtly without drawing attention, rather than copying their gestures directly like a mirror, which is imitation and can cause embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Using Language to Persuade Effectively

Beyond non-verbal cues, your choice of words and how you say them can have a [[psychological_secrets_to_influence_people | psychological effect]] on another person's subconscious, overcoming refusals and increasing compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This requires establishing a connection first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Here are techniques for [[effective_communication_strategies | effective communication strategies]] and [[effective_communication_and_expression_techniques_in_relationships | expression techniques]] to persuade:

### 1. Emphasize the Obvious
To make someone believe something is obvious, simply state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   "We both know it's worth it once we go there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
*   "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
*   "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>

### 2. Questions That Are Not Really Questions
To subtly prompt agreement, state what you want them to agree with and add a question at the end, ensuring your tone decreases, not increases, at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   "You already know everything about that, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
*   "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   "My plane is about to take off; there's no problem if I skipped a line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
*   **Caution**: This approach is useful in daily life but not for major commitments like marriage or large financial requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### 3. Get Them to Say "Yes"
*   **Use "Let's"**: Say "let's" followed by what you want to do. This acts as a disguised order, making refusal less likely compared to using "should we" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   "Let's walk a bit more." vs. "Should we walk a bit more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   **Train for Compliance**: The more someone says "yes," the more likely they are to continue saying "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. By getting them to agree multiple times, you train their mind to comply, entering a "yes mode." Save your main request for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:06:05]</a>.

### 4. This or That (Limited Options)
Offer two options, both suitable for you, but omit the choice to refuse entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait, or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> (Doesn't ask if you want *no* drink) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   "Red or white, sir?" or "Still or sparkling?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>
*   **Avoid**: "My place or your place?" (overused) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### 5. Anticipate the Future
Tell people how you expect them to react to something, influencing their actual reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   "I know you'll be thrilled about this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   "I know you'll want to repeat the experience." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you; I know you'll be impressed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

### 6. Logical Leaps
Use "therefore" or "this means that" to connect a true concept with a desired, potentially unrelated, concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   "You're watching this video (true); this means that you like it (maybe true)." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   "We've been together for 3 months; therefore, I must be serious about this relationship." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>

### 7. Order and Order
Give a desired command, then immediately follow it with an easily accepted command. The person will focus on the second, likely following the first without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   "It's late and you're tired. Take out the garbage and come to bed early." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   "Come over to my place to have a drink and tell me everything." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>

### 8. "I Shouldn't Tell You This, But..."
This approach fosters loyalty and trust, making others feel special and encouraging them to treat you as a confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### 9. "But" Statements
People give the most attention to what follows the word "but"; use it to emphasize your desired point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   "He is always late to work, but he's good at what he's doing." (Emphasizes his skill) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly to new environments." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
*   "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>

### 10. The "Ideal" Question
Phrases like "What do you ideally want?" or "What would be the ideal result?" encourage people to reveal their true desires, focusing on perfect outcomes rather than perceived possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Visualizing these perfect things positively affects their mood and provides information for you to [[psychological_secrets_to_influence_people | influence them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   In a job interview: "Ideally, what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" or "Who would be your ideal candidate?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Then, present yourself using the interviewer's own descriptive words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### 11. Tell It Without Telling It (Negative Framing for Suggestion)
Express your viewpoint and create images in others' minds by stating what you *don't* want to say or do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. You can also give orders by telling someone *not* to do what you actually want them to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
*   "I can't tell you to leave him; the decision must be yours." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   "I don't want you to worry about me; I'll be fine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>
*   "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

### 12. Yes Means No (Offering Something You Don't Want to Do)
Use phrases like "I could come if you want" as a way to offer something you don't genuinely desire to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   "I could give you a ride home if you want." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   "I could do it if you want." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>

### 13. It's Not Important, But It Is
Use these lines when delivering feedback that the other person might not welcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   "I know that you won't consider my advice, but I'm worried about your unhealthy lifestyle." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
*   "Maybe you won't care, but your deodorant is too weak and doesn't last long. Have you thought about keeping one for backup at the office?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:04]</a>

### 14. "I Don't Know If You Realize..."
This is a polite way to tell someone to listen or acknowledge your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
*   "I don't know if you realize how long I've been tolerating this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>

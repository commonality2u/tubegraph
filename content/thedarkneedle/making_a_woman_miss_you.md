For a woman to truly love you, she must first miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept is rooted in ancient human psychology, tracing back to the "caveman" era where men would disappear for long periods to hunt, causing their wives to experience longing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Women are emotional beings, and to make them attached, you must plant specific emotions within them, including the feeling of missing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## Debunking the "No Contact Rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

Many people mistakenly believe that to make a woman miss them, they must completely stop communicating with her, often referred to as the "no contact rule" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This advice typically suggests ceasing all communication and even social media posting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. However, simply following this rule without applying other strategies will likely result in her not missing you at all, and she might even forget you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Two Phases of Making Her Miss You <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

The feeling of missing someone involves two primary phases: when you are with her, and when you are away from her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

### Phase 1: When You Are With Her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>

This phase focuses on how you interact and communicate during dates or conversations to make her miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

#### Create a Unique Identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>
Drawing from marketing psychology, you should link one of her senses to your unique identity to embed yourself in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. The more senses you engage, the stronger the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

*   **Hearing**: Use a unique phrase or word as your signature that she hears consistently when interacting with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Sight**: Adopt a distinctive visual style, perhaps a specific color or accessory, that makes you immediately recognizable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. For example, wearing a specific ring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Smell**: Use a unique fragrance that becomes part of your identity, so people recognize you by your scent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The key is to add something unique to your personality that you consistently repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

#### End Conversations and Dates at Their Peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>
When you feel the conversation or date is at its most enjoyable point, that's the perfect time to end it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The goal is to leave her wanting more conversation with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

*   **Hard Way: Humor** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
    If you are naturally funny, you can try to make her laugh right before ending the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. This is difficult to control, but if you're both already laughing, you can suddenly end the conversation with a reason like needing to go to a meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

*   **Easy and Effective Way: Evoking Strong Emotions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>
    Since [[understanding_female_attraction | women are emotional beings]], they enjoy moments where they feel strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. When you're about to leave, make her feel something strong and then abruptly end the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This will make her mind go into confusion, and she'll keep thinking about you after you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

    > [!tip] Triggering Emotions:
    > Trigger emotions related to either the past or the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

    *   **Past Experiences**: Talk about her experiences, which are deeply tied to emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Ask questions like:
        *   "What made you move to this city?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
        *   "What's the biggest adventure you've been on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
        *   "What's the most exciting place you've visited?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>
        *   To deepen the connection, ask about her feelings: "How did it feel when you did [blah blah]?" or "What was your feeling during that moment?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
        *   You can relate by sharing different experiences that triggered similar emotions in you, but quickly shift the focus back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This shows genuine interest and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

    *   **Future Aspirations**: Discuss her goals, dreams, and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Few people get the chance to talk about their dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This stimulates positive and hopeful emotions that will automatically be associated with you in her subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Ask questions like:
        *   "What are your biggest goals?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
        *   "What are some things you've always wanted to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
        *   "What are you aiming to achieve this year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
        *   To deepen: "How would you feel if you did that?" or "What would your life look like if you accomplished that dream?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Phase 2: When You Are Away From Her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>

Attraction increases when you are not with her and not talking to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. You must allow her to experience missing you during these periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

#### Communication (Texting & Phone Calls) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>

Many [[mistakes_men_make_while_interacting_with_women | men make mistakes]] by trying to seem unavailable or playing "games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **Texting**: Do not deliberately delay replying to appear unavailable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Women are not naive and will realize you're playing games, leading to you losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Instead, be unavailable for a *real reason* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    *   Inform her that you are busy with work, study, or other commitments and do not use your phone before a certain time (e.g., 7 PM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
    *   Make this a consistent habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The goal is to show you are a busy man with things to do, not glued to your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

*   **Phone Calls**: Never answer all her calls immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. If she can predict all your actions, you've lost the "game" and she will start avoiding you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   Make her feel you have a busy life with things more important than instantly answering her calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   Example: "Hey, how are you? I'm a bit busy right now, call me later, I'm watching a movie." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>
    *   This may annoy her slightly, but it will subconsciously increase her interest because she realizes she has to work to gain your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. This encourages her to put in more effort to attract you, which boosts her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

#### Dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>

*   Do not meet her all the time, especially in the beginning before she becomes your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   Aim to see her once a week, or at most twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   Avoid daily dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.
*   Incorporate long periods of absence from time to time, such as not seeing her for two weeks and reducing communication during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   This absence should be for a *reason*, like traveling, focusing on a project, or being busy with something important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Even if you're not actually traveling, you can tell her you have an important project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This gives her space and the opportunity to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

By combining these strategies, you will trigger feelings of longing within her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

To foster love and attachment in a relationship, a woman must experience the feeling of missing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Women are emotional beings, and for a woman to become attached, certain emotions, including missing you, must be planted within her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Historically, the "caveman's wife" would miss him during his long hunting absences, leading to the development of this essential feeling of longing in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Avoiding the "No Contact Rule" Misconception

A common mistake is believing that completely stopping communication will make a woman miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Many online resources promote a "no contact rule," suggesting you cease talking or even posting on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This approach is ineffective and can lead to her forgetting you entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Playing such "silly dating games" can result in losing the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Instead, making a woman miss you involves two main phases:
1.  When you are with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
2.  When you are away from her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Making Her Miss You When You Are Together

When interacting with a woman, your goal is to leave a lasting impression and cultivate a desire for more interaction.

### Create a Unique Identity

Apply principles from marketing psychology to "embed your brand" in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This involves adding something unique to your personality and consistently linking it to her senses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>:
*   **Hearing:** Use a unique word, phrase, or accent when greeting people or in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Smell:** Adopt a unique fragrance that becomes part of your identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Sight:** Wear a distinctive accessory, like a specific ring, or adopt a unique visual style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The more senses you engage with your unique identity, the stronger the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### End Conversations and Dates at Their Peak

Always aim to end a conversation or date when it is at its most enjoyable, leaving the woman wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The last 10 minutes should be particularly enjoyable for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

#### Method 1: Using Humor (Hard Way)
If you are naturally funny, you can try to make her laugh towards the end of the conversation or date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. If you are already laughing, you can suddenly end the conversation with a simple reason like, "Alright, I have to go now, I have a meeting with my friend. Goodbye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This is difficult to control consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

#### Method 2: Triggering Strong Emotions (Easy & Effective)
Since women are emotional beings and enjoy experiencing strong emotions, make her feel something profound just before you end the conversation or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. When you abruptly stop talking after triggering such emotions, her mind will enter a state of confusion, and she will continue thinking about you throughout the day without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

You can trigger emotions by discussing topics related to her past or future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>:
*   **Past Experiences:** Experiences are deeply tied to emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Ask questions like:
    *   "What made you move to this city?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>
    *   "What's the biggest adventure you've been on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
    *   "What's the most exciting place you've visited?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   To deepen the connection, ask about the *emotions* behind her experiences: "How did it feel when you did [blah blah blah]?" or "What was your feeling during that moment?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. You can relate by sharing different experiences that triggered similar emotions in you, but quickly shift the focus back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This makes her feel understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Future Aspirations:** Discussing her goals, dreams, and ambitions stimulates positive and hopeful emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. These emotions will then be subconsciously associated with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Most people rarely get to talk about their dreams because few ask <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Ask questions such as:
    *   "What are your biggest goals?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
    *   "What are some things you've always wanted to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
    *   "What are you aiming to achieve this year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>
    *   To deepen: "How would you feel if you did that?" or "What would your life look like if you accomplished that dream?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

By opening a discussion on past experiences or future aspirations just before leaving, you stimulate deep emotional feelings in her, making her think about you and miss you after the conversation ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Making Her Miss You When You Are Away

Attraction tends to build when you are not with a woman and not talking to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Avoid the common mistake of feeling pressure to constantly communicate for fear of being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Communication Over the Phone

#### Texting
Avoid "silly dating games" like deliberately delaying replies to appear busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Women are not naive and will realize you're playing a game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

Instead, genuinely not reply because you have a real reason, such as being busy with work, studying, or other commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Communicate this clearly to her. For example, tell her you don't use your phone before 7:00 p.m. because you are busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Make this a consistent habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The goal is to show you are a busy man with things to do, not glued to your phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

#### Phone Calls
Never answer all her calls immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Being too available makes her feel she has "figured you out completely," which can lead to her avoiding you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

Make her feel you have a busy life and that other things are more important than answering her calls instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. For example, you can say, "Hey, how are you? I'm a bit busy right now. Call me later. I'm watching a movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. While this might annoy her slightly, it subconsciously increases her interest because she realizes she needs to work to gain your attention, not the other way around. This prompts her to put in more effort, boosting her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Dates and Absence

Do not meet her all the time, especially in the early stages before she becomes your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Aim to see her once or at most twice a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Never go on daily dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

Introduce long periods of absence from time to time. For instance, don't see her for two weeks and reduce communication during this time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This absence must be for a *reason*, such as traveling for something important, or needing to focus on a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Even if you aren't actually traveling or working on something serious, tell her you have an important project or are busy for a certain period, and thus won't be able to see her for two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This gives her the space and opportunity to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

By combining these strategies, you will effectively trigger feelings of longing and make a woman miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

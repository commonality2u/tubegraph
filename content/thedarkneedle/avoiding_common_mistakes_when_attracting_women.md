This article explores why a girl might be ignoring you and offers a technique to make her pursue you, focusing on [[common_mistakes_men_make_with_women]] and how to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Reasons a Girl Might Ignore You

A girl might ignore you for two primary reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:
1.  **It's a test**: This occurs when a woman is already interested in you, perhaps someone you've dated or sensed interest from before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **She perceives you as a guy with limited options**: This is the more likely scenario, especially if she wasn't interested from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. She feels you're chasing her because she's your only focus, sensing you don't have many other options in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

> "You saw her, liked her, and started giving her way too much attention, making her feel like she's the only girl you want and that you're willing to do anything to please her because you believe you don't have much value and your only dream is for her to notice you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>

## A Major Mistake: Lying About Having Options

A common mistake is believing you need to lie about having many options to seem more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The speaker admits to making this mistake by inventing stories about imaginary girls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

> "Please don't make the same mistake I did because this approach leads to only two outcomes: either the girl will figure out you're lying and trust me, she'll find out easily, and lying is a huge attraction killer because it makes her feel like you're willing to do anything to get her approval, or the second outcome is that she'll understand that you're trying to convey that you have lots of options, which means you're seeking her approval." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>

Seeking a woman's approval, whether through direct lies or subtle hints, is one of the biggest mistakes in [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## The Solution: The Qualifying Technique

Women are not primarily concerned with the number of options you actually have, but rather how you interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. If you treat a woman as if you have options, she will assume you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The best way to achieve this is through the [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | Qualifying Technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### What is Qualifying?
Qualifying means screening or filtering potential partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This is something only someone with many options would do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you automatically subconsciously communicate that you have many options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This technique is powerful and often overlooked, helping to solidify a girl's attraction from casual flirting to genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The mantra to remember is: "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

Qualifying makes her feel like you are choosing her over others, and that she needs to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. It emphasizes that you like her for her personality and who she is, not just her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. If you don't qualify her, she might assume you're just trying to "get into her pants" or that you have limited options and will take any girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. When you do qualify her, she will see you as choosy because you have options, and that she has been chosen for a specific reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Here are three ways to qualify a girl and make her feel special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>:

### 1. The Qualifying Question
Ask questions that prompt her to share positive qualities about herself, then acknowledge those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

**Example 1**:
> "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   This makes her think about how to impress you and prompts her to "sell herself" to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   When she responds, accept her answer by saying something like, "Wow, that's really cool. I like that about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This makes her feel special and seen beyond just her appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

**Example 2**:
> "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to, and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
*   Always accept what she tells you; otherwise, she'll feel rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   This technique makes her feel like she won you over with her personality, which is crucial, especially for attractive women who are tired of being valued only for their looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've noticed in her, then ask if it's true. When she agrees, she'll feel good and begin to act more consistently with that quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

**Example 1**:
> "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   The goal is to end with a question that invites her to say "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Once she confirms, she will naturally become more open around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   This makes her feel you recognize something unique and valuable about her, creating a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

**Example 2**:
> "You know what I like about you? You're so bold. Like, you don't filter yourself at all. You just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing. It makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression. I could be wrong, would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   Ensure the statement is positive, open-ended, and vague enough that she can't definitively say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   Common qualities to highlight include being open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, or easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

**For extremely attractive women**:
> "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>
*   Attractive women often wish to be recognized for their intelligence rather than just their looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. People tend to value compliments they don't typically receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself
Girls will often qualify themselves to you without prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This includes:
*   Bragging or telling you things about herself to gain your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touching you or showing direct interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asking if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you notice a girl trying to impress you or gain your liking, acknowledge her for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is "cool," express that you like her, or use physical touch to show acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

If you don't acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. But when you do, she'll feel great and continue to pursue you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This principle applies to all social interactions, not just with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

> "Acknowledge the things you appreciate about them out loud." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
> "You know what I like about you? You know what I just noticed about you? Hold up, I gotta acknowledge you for just a minute. When was the last time someone told you how awesome you are for doing XYZ?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>

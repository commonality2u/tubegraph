Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose the woman herself and also lose yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One significant mistake that can lead to this outcome is showing emotional dependence too early in a relationship, often referred to as "leaning before it's time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Early Emotional Dependence

Leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction for you is a guaranteed way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. While opening your heart and showing vulnerability can be a powerful way to build [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | intimacy]] and [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional connection]], it is considered "emotional suicide" if a proper foundation has not yet been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

A woman requires a certain level of certainty and trust in you before it is appropriate to reveal your most vulnerable side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Although women are naturally nurturing and supportive, this support must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. A high-quality woman is willing to stand by her man through challenges, provided he has proven himself worthy of her support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Consequences of Early Weakness

When you show weakness too early in the relationship, or lean on a woman before she is fully sure about you, she perceives it as a sign of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. If you haven't already convinced her of your strength, this vulnerability can cause fear and anxiety to creep into her mind, potentially leading her to test you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. She may feel the need to test you to determine if the moment of weakness was an isolated incident or a recurring part of your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

#### Case Study: The High School Test

An example from a women's dating advice website illustrates this point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>:
> A young man in high school, interested in a girl, opened up emotionally by recounting his feelings at his father's funeral, breaking down in tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Although she sympathized, she felt unsettled by his emotional display, having seen his weakness very early in their budding relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
>
> A few days later, when he asked for her photo, she decided to test him, wanting to give him a second chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. She told him to stay up all night until one of her favorite songs played on the radio, promising the picture as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. The man fell into the trap and complied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. As a result, she lost all attraction for him and broke up with him shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited until she was more [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotionally invested]] before revealing his deeper side, she would not have pushed him away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

In the early stages, some women are simply not ready to deal with the full spectrum of a man's emotional side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While men have insecurities and desire acceptance, exposing your soul to a woman who hasn't yet seen your strength and confidence can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

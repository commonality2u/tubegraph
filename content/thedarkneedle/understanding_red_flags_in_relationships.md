The concept of "red flags" in relationships can be a source of confusion, particularly when societal terms like "red flags," "green flags," and "soulmates" become widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Attempting to find a partner by listing desired "green flags" and "red flags" to avoid is unlikely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. According to one perspective, anyone who provides a definitive list of red flags to avoid either misunderstands how dating works or operates under different rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. While some traditional "red flags," such as a woman having male friends, are considered "nonsense," genuine red flags do exist and warrant caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is impossible to find a partner who possesses every desired quality, so this expectation should be abandoned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Navigating Personal Preferences and Influence in Relationships

When you encounter a woman whose appearance you like, and she doesn't exhibit the true red flags discussed later, you can begin dating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. If there are things you dislike about her, such as her clothing style or interactions with other men, the suggested approach is not to leave her, but to influence her to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A woman should gradually adjust her personality, thoughts, and behavior to align with her partner's desires as the relationship progresses and she falls in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### The Role of Leadership

In any relationship, there is typically a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It is asserted that the man should be the leader in a relationship with a woman, controlling aspects such as what she wears, the principles she lives by, and even her preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. However, this should not be achieved through force, control, or manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Instead, the goal is for her to *want* to do what pleases you out of her own free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

### Three Steps to Influencing Your Partner

The strategy for influencing a woman can be summarized as: "You tell her what you want, but you don't force it on her, and at the same time, you should not need her to do what you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

1.  **How to Tell Her:**
    *   Do not state your opinion immediately, such as on the first date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
    *   Wait until she asks you about your preferences, which she will eventually do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
    *   When she asks or the topic arises, state your taste simply, without justifying it or engaging in debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
    *   Do not change your opinion, even if she tries to pressure you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Changing your opinion signals a loss of your leadership position and will cause her to lose attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

2.  **How Not to Force It:**
    *   When expressing a preference (e.g., about clothing), do not present it as a major issue, or as something that causes jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   Communicate your preference in a "cold and indifferent manner," as if simply sharing what you like, without implying that a lack of change will end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

3.  **How Not to Show Your Need:**
    *   Do not display a need for her to change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   If she doesn't immediately adopt your preference (e.g., wears revealing clothes after you've expressed a dislike for them), do not mention it or give it attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.
    *   Ignoring it shows her you don't *need* the change, which can lead her to question why you haven't brought it up again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
    *   This strategy suggests that over time, as her attachment to you grows, she will naturally begin to change to align with your desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

## True Red Flags to Avoid

There are specific traits in a woman that are considered genuine red flags, indicating that a relationship will lead to suffering and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. These are traits that cannot be changed.

### 1. Flirting with Other Men

If a woman flirts with other men in your presence, she likely seeks attention or aims to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This behavior, often accompanied by eye-catching attire and heavy makeup, indicates a desire for male attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Remaining in such a relationship will likely lead to drama and increased frequency of this behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Crucially, never show jealousy, as this signals a loss of the "battle" and fulfills her objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 2. Still Attached to Her Ex

If a woman admits to still thinking about her ex and not having moved on, it's advisable to step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This signifies unresolved [[emotional_decision_making_in_relationships | emotional baggage]] from her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A "high-value man" should have a friendly conversation with her, even suggesting she give her ex another chance, which demonstrates a willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This can prompt her to think more clearly and make the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. Women who haven't moved past previous relationships often bring up their exes, negatively impacting the current relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### 3. Energy-Sucking Women

This is considered the most dangerous red flag, emphasizing the importance of not hesitating to walk away from a problematic relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. These women drain your emotional health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Key characteristics include:

*   **Insecurity and Validation Seeking:** They are deeply insecure, constantly seeking validation despite outward beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This emotional hunger is insatiable, regardless of how much attention or appreciation they receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Using Sex for Validation:** They may use sex to fulfill these emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. Women who are already in relationships but sleep with other men often do so due to this "emotional hunger" that can never be satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. They may offer sex readily in exchange for admiration, as a way to boost their low self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Drama and Manipulation:** Such women are often "drama queens" capable of turning positive situations into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. They might resort to manipulation due to feeling unworthy or undeserving of good things in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

It is crucial to assess a woman's personality deeply before committing to a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## When a Woman Mentions Other Men

If a woman talks about other men in front of you, there are two primary reasons:

1.  **She is trying to signal her desirability:** If a new acquaintance tells you about being approached by other men and receiving compliments (e.g., at a bar), she is likely trying to impress you and indicate that she is desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Her goal is to prompt you to ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
2.  **She sees you only as a friend:** If she discusses an ex-boyfriend she still loves, or actively seeks ways to reconcile with him, she is likely attempting to "dump her emotions on you" and place you in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This indicates genuine interest in the other man and that she is carrying significant [[emotional_decision_making_in_relationships | emotional baggage]] from her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. In this scenario, it is advisable to walk away and let her resolve her issues independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

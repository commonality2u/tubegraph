The ability to make individuals admire and become "obsessed" with you relies on identifying and leveraging their "weak points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Every human possesses four such points, with one often being significantly stronger than the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. By recognizing these vulnerabilities, one can effectively influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Identifying the Thirst for Validation

The "thirst for validation" is identified as the first weak point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. While everyone enjoys feeling appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>, some individuals develop an "excessive thirst for validation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This trait is easily detectable as such people constantly strive to prove their uniqueness and seek admiration from those around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. They might frequently discuss their accomplishments, recount impressive moments, or boast about attracting romantic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. These individuals also tend to desire control within their social circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. To cater to this desire for control, one can occasionally let them make decisions, such as where to eat or drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## The Ineffectiveness of Direct Praise

For those seeking validation, praise serves as a "bait" to foster attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. However, this praise must be delivered "correctly and intelligently" to impact their subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Direct compliments, such as "your style is nice" or "you look great," are considered "useless" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Such direct praise can make the giver appear to be "sucking up" and its effect dissipates quickly, forgotten within minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## The Power of Indirect Praise

To be effective, praise must always be indirect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The goal is to make the person *feel* praised, rather than merely hearing a direct compliment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This approach ensures the praise is unexpected and affects them on a deeper, subconscious level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

### Examples of Indirect Praise

1.  **Seeking Advice or Opinion:**
    *   Approach the person and ask for their advice on a specific (even if made-up) problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
    *   When they offer a solution, respond with genuine surprise, like "Wow, you're absolutely right! I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
    *   This makes them feel "intellectually superior" and appreciated for providing value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

2.  **Highlighting Achievements Through a Third Party:**
    *   If the person is known for an achievement (e.g., running 6 miles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
    *   Ask them about it (e.g., "how many miles do you usually run?") and then remain silent after their answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
    *   They will likely ask why you asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
    *   Reply by stating that you and someone else (e.g., "Henry") were discussing their achievement and acknowledged its impressiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
    *   This indirectly validates their achievement and makes them feel appreciated because others are talking about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. This type of praise can make them think about the conversation for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

3.  **Joking About Positive Qualities:**
    *   Make a joke about something they are proud of or a positive quality they possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
    *   For example, if someone is tall, jokingly ask "how's the weather up there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This reinforces their pride in their height <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   If they successfully get a woman's number, instead of a direct compliment, wait a while and then joke about it later, like "dude, how did you even pull that off?" while laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

## The Addictive Nature of Indirect Praise

When you effectively target someone's "weak points" with indirect praise, it's akin to providing them with a "drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. As the initial effect wears off, their brain will crave more, associating that positive feeling directly with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. This process leads them to subconsciously desire more interaction with you, making them "addicted" without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Individuals with a [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | thirst for validation]] are noted as the easiest to manipulate through this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

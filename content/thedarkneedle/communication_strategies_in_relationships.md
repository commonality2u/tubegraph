The feeling of longing is considered crucial for love and attachment in a relationship, or even at its beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Women, as emotional beings, need certain emotions like missing you to become attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. The goal is to make a woman miss you, whether or not you are in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

A common misconception is that completely stopping communication, often referred to as the "no contact rule," will make a woman miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. However, this approach is deemed ineffective; without specific actions, she may not miss you, or might even forget you entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

The process of making someone miss you involves two main phases: when you are with them, and when you are away from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a>.

## When You Are With Her

### Cultivating a Unique Identity

Inspired by marketing psychology, the principle is to link one of a person's senses to your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. This can be achieved by adding something unique to your personality and consistently repeating it, engaging multiple senses for a stronger impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Signature Phrase**: Using a unique word or accent when greeting people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Fragrance**: Using a distinct scent that becomes part of your identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Distinctive Accessory**: Wearing a specific ring or unique piece of clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:00">[03:23:00]</a>.

### Ending Interactions at Their Peak

It is advised to end a conversation or date when it is at its most enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. The goal is to leave her wanting more conversation with you, ensuring the last 10 minutes are very enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

There are two primary ways to achieve this:

1.  **The "Hard Way" (Using Humor)**:
    *   If you are naturally funny, try to make her laugh as the interaction is about to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
    *   If you are both already laughing, suddenly end the conversation by stating you have to leave for an important reason (e.g., a meeting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This method is difficult to control as laughter cannot be directly demanded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

2.  **The "Easy and Most Effective Way" (Triggering Strong Emotions)**:
    *   Since women are emotional beings, make her feel a strong emotion just before suddenly ending the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. This creates confusion and causes her to continue thinking about you after you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.
    *   To do this, trigger emotions related to either the past or the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:45:00">[05:45:00]</a>:
        *   **Past Experiences**: Discuss her experiences (e.g., childhood, travel, career changes) that are deeply tied to emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Ask "how did it feel?" or "what was your feeling during that moment?" to delve into the emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. You can relate by sharing experiences that triggered similar emotions, but shift the focus back to her to show genuine interest and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
        *   **Future Aspirations**: Discuss her goals, dreams, and ambitions. This stimulates positive and hopeful emotions, which will then be associated with you in her subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Ask questions like "how would you feel if you did that?" or "what would your life look like if you accomplished that dream?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

## When You Are Away From Her

Attraction tends to build when you are not physically present or actively communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. This period is crucial for fostering the feeling of missing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>.

### Communication Strategies (Phone)

Many common pieces of advice regarding texting, such as "don't reply too fast" or "don't text her too much," are considered foolish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Deliberately delaying replies can make her think you are playing games, which will lead to losing her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.

Instead, the approach is to be unavailable for genuine reasons:
*   **Texting**: Do not reply because you have a real commitment (e.g., work, studying) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. For example, establish a consistent habit of not texting before 7:00 PM and clearly communicate that you are busy until then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. The key is not to be available all day, signaling that you are a busy man with other priorities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   **Phone Calls**: Never answer every call immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. If she can predict all your actions and fully understand you, you risk losing her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. Make her feel that you have a busy life and that other things are more important than instantly answering her calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. This seemingly annoying behavior subconsciously increases her interest, as it signals she needs to work to gain your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

### Dating Frequency

It is advised not to meet her too frequently, especially in the early stages before she becomes your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Meeting once or at most twice a week is recommended, avoiding daily dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.

Additionally, incorporate periods of extended absence from time to time, such as two weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. This absence should be for a stated reason (e.g., travel, an important project) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. This creates space and opportunity for her to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

By combining these [[Effective communication strategies in relationships | strategies]], you can trigger feelings of longing and provide a reason for her to miss you when you're not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

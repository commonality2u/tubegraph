However, in reality, most people who enter healthy relationships and [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract women]] do not possess these superficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attracting women]] is presented as easier than commonly thought, requiring a return to basic principles of [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## It's Not About Superficial Traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>

The belief that you need a strong body, money, or seduction techniques to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract women]] is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many individuals in healthy relationships do not possess these things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attracting women]] is described as "very easy" and simpler than expected, by forgetting superficial tips and focusing on basic [[attracting_women_and_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Women Don't Judge Based on Looks, Words, or Money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>

A common misconception is that women judge men based on their looks, words, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Instead, women judge based on the feelings circulating inside you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Your internal feelings reflect on your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For instance, being nervous leads to a higher chance of rejection because the woman senses a lack of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Conversely, a confident, calm, and relaxed approach elicits a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Success with women is described as a state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Avoid [[common_mistakes_men_make_with_women | Seeking Approval]] and Putting Her on a Pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>

A significant misconception is that men need to pander to a woman's every whim or put her on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This behavior, such as trying too hard or making a spectacle to gain attention, often stems from an inner sense of inadequacy and a hidden deficiency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The best way to impress a woman is by not trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. When a man stops seeking a woman's approval, she becomes genuinely impressed because she encounters someone different from the many men who try to woo her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

[[common_mistakes_men_make_with_women | Seeking validation]] is deeply rooted in self-perception and low self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Men who constantly [[common_mistakes_men_make_with_women | seek approval]] often surrender their power for acceptance, implying a fear of losing the girl even before interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This leads them to act in ways to avert potential rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. The moment a woman senses a man is craving her approval, she can lose interest immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, as this desperate need for approval is a major [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Rejection is Insignificant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>

Another misconception is that rejection is devastating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. Men who excel at [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracting women]] understand that rejection is an insignificant part of the dating landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. They are not perturbed by a woman's reaction, focusing instead on enjoying the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Being indifferent to the outcome means not worrying about the woman's response and focusing on making the most of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Don't Award Extra Points for Looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>

Many men mistakenly lose control and act unusually jittery around an [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attractive woman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Placing a woman on a "divine pedestal" solely for physical attractiveness, which she didn't necessarily work for, is a mistake that leads to fumbling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. By avoiding extra niceness based on looks, an intriguing phenomenon occurs where the woman may begin to seek your validation because you didn't readily hand it over like others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This categorizes you as "different and unique," sparking her genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Don't Settle â€“ Have High Standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

A common [[common_mistakes_men_make_with_women | mistake men make]] is settling for "what's available" when their ideal woman seems unattainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. A man who truly understands [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] never settles; he always goes for the best and chooses the women he genuinely wants to date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He has high standards and adheres to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

## Don't Compromise Principles or Change for Her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>

Men often mistakenly modify their behavior or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, stemming from a fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This is likened to being a "dead fish in the stream," lacking control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. By reshaping your life to suit hers, you convey that you view her as higher value and that you need to change to match that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

A high-value man puts his principles above all else, even the woman he's with, and isn't afraid to step back if his principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. If a woman doesn't appreciate certain aspects of you, she doesn't deserve you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. You shouldn't alter who you are to make a woman feel at ease; instead, if she wants to be with you, she needs to adapt to your reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. A high-value man shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

## Overcoming the Scarcity Mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>

A final misconception is fixating on one woman and operating from a scarcity mindset. A high-value man understands there's no shortage of [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attractive women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. He doesn't put all his hopes in one woman and knows that if one rejects him, plenty of other opportunities exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. He sees abundance, not scarcity, when it comes to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Ultimately, [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracting women]] is described as a mindset shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, emphasizing that "theory without practice is futile" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

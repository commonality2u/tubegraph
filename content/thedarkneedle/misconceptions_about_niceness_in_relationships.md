Many men believe that being kind and making compromises will help them avoid problems in their relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:19">[02:17:19]</a>. However, this approach can inadvertently lead to a woman feeling unsafe and even cause a relationship to fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>. This article explores the [[the_importance_of_not_being_overly_nice_or_neutral | importance of not being overly nice or neutral]] and how genuine strength and boundaries foster [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | emotional safety in relationships]] and attraction.

## The Pitfall of Being "Too Nice"

A common misconception is that constant niceness ensures a stable relationship. The speaker recounts an anecdote of a friend whose wife divorced him after five or six years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a>. The reason for the divorce was that she "didn't feel safe with him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:27">[00:29:27]</a>. This friend was described as "too nice," never standing up to her, letting her cross boundaries, and always trying to help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:49">[02:10:49]</a>. He thought kindness and compromise would prevent issues, but the outcome was a lack of [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | safety]] for his wife, leading to her departure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>.

## The Evolutionary Need for a "Dangerous" Man

For a woman to feel safe with a man, particularly when considering primitive human eras where men protected their families from danger, he needed to possess certain qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:06">[00:56:06]</a>. While strength and height are good, they aren't the primary factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:07">[01:09:07]</a>. A strong man might still abandon his family in the face of danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. Instead, women became genetically programmed to seek a man with "the ability to be dangerous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:03">[01:26:03]</a>, meaning he has the capacity to cause harm if necessary for protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>.

This explains the phenomenon of attraction to "bad boys" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:02">[01:48:02]</a>, or even criminals in prison, who appear strong and display a dangerous side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:52">[01:50:52]</a>. This attraction stems from a genetic draw to strong men who evoke a feeling of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>.

## How to Show Strength Without Being a "Bad Boy"

The goal is not to become a literal "bad boy," as this is not a successful long-term strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. Instead, men should adopt the attractive traits of a "bad boy" – strength and assertiveness – while maintaining their morals and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>. The right way to show a woman you can protect her is by demonstrating your ability to [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | set boundaries]] for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:06">[03:03:06]</a>. A woman understands a man's character by how he interacts with her; if she can disrespect or manipulate him, she will perceive him as incapable of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:47">[03:11:47]</a>.

### 1. Don't Be Afraid of Her Reaction

A man who has the ability to be dangerous is not afraid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:38">[03:33:38]</a>. This fearlessness is demonstrated by not being afraid of *her* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. Your behavior and conversations should resemble a relationship between a strong man and a woman who craves him, not a boy terrified of upsetting his mother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. If you behave like a fearful boy, she may reluctantly take on a maternal [[role_expectations_in_relationships | role]] you've unknowingly forced upon her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. Women often test men, and deep down, they want men to push back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. They prefer to feel attraction and admiration for a strong, authoritative man rather than contempt for a fearful, approval-seeking one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

Common examples of men acting out of fear include:
*   **Lying to avoid punishment**: If you lie to avoid upsetting her, you are not acting like a real man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Your honesty should not be dictated by her emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of "I'll be there soon" (when you won't), say "I'm running late" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of "Yes, I did it already" (when you forgot), say "No, I didn't. Thanks for the reminder; I'll get to it after" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of feigning selective memory, if you don't want to do something, say so directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of "I'm fine" (when you're not), be honest about needing space or how you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of "It didn't cost that much" (when it did), be honest, especially if financial agreement is important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
    *   Instead of fabricating excuses like "I didn't have a signal," be honest if you screened a call or were busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:12:00">[06:12:00]</a>. A mature man isn't afraid to tell his woman he's occupied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding confrontation**: Men often tell small lies to avoid conflict or perceived punishment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. This "path of least resistance" has negative long-term consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **Excessive apologizing**: Stop apologizing excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The moment you fear a woman's reaction, you lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. When you tell a woman the truth, even if she dislikes it, her attraction to you increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

### 2. Develop the Ability to Confront

Beyond fearlessness, a man must have the ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This means being willing to confront *her* and express yourself clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid being a "yes man"**: A "yes man" agrees with everything his woman says or does, even if it's wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. This indicates a lack of personal opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>.
*   **Stick to your opinion**: Women often test if you'll stick to your opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. She wants to see that you are honest with yourself, capable of disagreeing, and can still get along <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. Having your own preferences and expressing them earns respect and admiration, making her feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If you loved a movie she hated, a strong man would say, "Well, you're entitled to your opinion, but I still think it was a spectacular movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Playful confrontation**: If you're known for joking, you can be playful. "Wow, and here I thought you had good taste. Oh well, I guess I'm the cultured one in this relationship, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>.
    *   **Setting clear boundaries**: If she routinely gives you a hard time for disagreeing, make it clear you're entitled to your opinion and not interested in justifying it. "Look, you asked for my opinion, and I gave it. If you don't like hearing the truth from me, I suggest you think twice before asking what I think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>.
*   **Refuse to argue**: If you've expressed your opinion and she tries to push you into an argument, firmly state, "I won't argue about this," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:12:00]</a>. Don't be afraid to express your opinion because she might try to impose hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

When you approach a woman this way, she will internally feel your ability to confront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>. Over time, this builds a unique sense of [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | security]] and makes her see you as a reliable man in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Being overly nice is not beneficial in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. This advice is not out of dislike for women or a suggestion to be harsh, but rather an act of love for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. Women want men to be strong so they can feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. The feeling of safety is one of the most important emotions that keep a woman attached for the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

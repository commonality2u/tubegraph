To convince someone to adopt your perspective or act as you desire, there are two primary steps: first, understand their mindset, and second, influence their thinking by carefully selecting your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach is also applicable when seeking to attract or win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

A crucial prerequisite for successful [[techniques_to_influence_thoughts_and_actions | influence]] through words is establishing a connection with the other person first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

## Speaking to Their Awareness

The second step in influencing someone involves choosing the right words to speak directly to their awareness and influence their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It's not merely about *what* you communicate, but *how* you articulate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. By strategically using words, you can achieve a [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | psychological effect]] on their subconscious, bypass potential refusals, and increase the likelihood of agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Strategic Phrasing Techniques

Once a connection has been established, various phrases can be used to influence others:

*   **Emphasize the Obvious**
    To make someone believe something is evident, simply state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Ask a Question That Isn't Really a Question (Tag Questions)**
    To encourage subconscious agreement, state your desired agreement and then add a tag question at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Ensure the tone of voice decreases at the end, rather than increasing like a typical question, to avoid inviting a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, "Probably it's time for another drink, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>, "My plane is about to take off. There's no problem if I skipped a line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
    *   *Caution:* This approach is generally useful in everyday situations and should not be relied upon for significant life decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

*   **Get Them to Say Yes (Yes Mode)**
    Encouraging someone to say "yes" repeatedly trains their mind to comply, leading them into a "yes mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Save the most important request for the end, after they have already agreed to several smaller things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Using "Let's" implies a disguised order, making it harder for others to refuse compared to "Should we...?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "Let's walk a bit more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, "Let's have another one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, "Let's go to my place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   **Offer Choices Where All Options Suit You ("This or That")**
    Presenting only options that are favorable to you ensures that, regardless of their choice, the outcome aligns with your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> (rather than asking if they want to drink alcohol at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>), "water or wine, red or white sir, or still or sparkling" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
    *   *Avoid:* Overused lines like "my place or your place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

*   **Anticipate the Future**
    Tell people how you expect them to react to something, which can influence their actual reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "I know you'll be thrilled about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, "I know you'll want to repeat the experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you, I know you'll be impressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

*   **Logical Leaps**
    Use "therefore" or "this means that" to connect two concepts, where the first is true, and the second is the desired conclusion, even if the connection isn't inherently logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This is a common [[manipulation_strategies_in_communication | manipulation strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "You're watching this video [true], this means that you like it [desired conclusion]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, "We've been together for 3 months, therefore I must be serious about this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **Order and Order**
    Give a desired command, then immediately follow it with another command that you are confident will be followed. The recipient often hears only the second and follows the first without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "It's late and you're tired. Take out the garbage and come to bed early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, "Come over to my place to have a dream, then tell me everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

*   **"I Shouldn't Tell You This But..."**
    This phrase creates a feeling of loyalty and trust, making others feel special and encouraging them to treat you as a confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **The "But" Emphasis**
    In a statement with "but," the emphasis is placed on what follows the word "but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "He is always late to work, but he's good at what he's doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> (emphasizes he's good), "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly to new environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

*   **The Ideal Question**
    Asking "What do you ideally want?" or "What would be the ideal result?" prompts others to think about perfect scenarios rather than just possible ones, creating positive imagery and providing valuable information for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "What do you ideally want?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>, "What are you ideally seeing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>, "What would you ideally like to happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
    *   During a job interview, asking "ideally what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" can help you tailor your responses to match their desired image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

*   **Tell it Without Telling it**
    Express your viewpoint or give subtle commands by stating what you *can't* or *don't* want to do, thereby implying what you *do* want the other person to understand or do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "I can't tell you to leave him, the decision must be yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> (implies they should leave him), "I won't be the one to tell you that you're wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a> (implies they are wrong).

*   **"Yes Means No"**
    Offer to do something you don't truly want to do by phrasing it as an option they can decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "I could give you a ride home if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, "I could do it if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

*   **"It's Not Important But It Is"**
    This phrasing allows you to provide feedback that the other person might not want to hear or might dislike, by downplaying its importance before delivering the message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "I know that you won't consider my advice but I'm worried about your unhealthy lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>, "Maybe you won't care but your deodorant is too weak and doesn't last long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.

*   **"I Don't Know If You Realize..."**
    A polite way to demand attention and make someone listen, implying that they are unaware of your situation or feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   *Examples:* "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, "I don't know if you realize how long I've been tolerating this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

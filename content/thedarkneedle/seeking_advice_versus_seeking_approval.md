Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose both the woman and yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Three common mistakes can prevent a man from gaining a woman's respect.

## Mistake One: Not Distinguishing Between Seeking Approval and Seeking Advice

Women inherently enjoy helping and bonding emotionally through offering support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Asking a woman for advice can quickly create a connection, whether in the short or long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. If you like a girl and want her attention, simply asking for advice can increase her engagement in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

The crucial distinction lies in the **motivation** behind asking for an opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Many men ask not to hear her opinion, but to be reassured that they are making the right decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This often manifests in questions like, "What do you think if I go out with the guys tonight?" or "Do you think I should accept this opportunity?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Underneath these questions, they are often implicitly asking, "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

When a man makes decisions based on anticipating a woman's reaction, he is operating out of fear rather than his own values and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Women quickly perceive this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. The moment your decisions are centered around pleasing her, she becomes the focal point of your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. While she might not outwardly react, her respect begins to erode as she recognizes your dependence on her [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | approval to be yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Furthermore, trying too hard not to upset her makes you easier to manipulate and more predictable, a tendency women may consciously or unconsciously test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Practical Advice

When seeking a woman's opinion, ensure your motive is genuine curiosity, not fear of her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Your personal life decisions, such as traveling or going out with friends, should not depend on her happiness or require her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Leadership in Shared Decisions

For decisions involving both partners, a man must assert his leadership. Consider this example: if you suggest going to the movies, and she suggests going to the pool, yielding to her preference makes her the leader and can lead to a loss of your respect and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Instead, respectfully decline her suggestion and reassert your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If she still resists, clearly state your intention to proceed with your plan, even if it means going alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Over time, this consistent assertion of your desires will lead her to accept your leadership and follow you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Her emotions should not dictate your life choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Women desire a leader, and this is the path to embodying that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Mistake Two: Sending the Message That You Expect Her to Reject You

This mistake involves reacting to perceived rejection, such as a girl posting a picture with another guy or not replying to a message, by bringing it up with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Such actions communicate to her that you anticipate her rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

It is a "golden rule" that women, universally, enjoy making you feel as if you haven't yet impacted them significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. While she might show interest, it's rare for her to display early emotional attachment or desire for a serious relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This behavior, often unconscious, serves as a test of your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. If you become upset when she doesn't respond, she gains power over you, which reduces her attraction, as she seeks strength in a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Dealing with Perceived Rejection

When a woman appears to reject you or imply she doesn't want you, understand it as a test of your confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Maintain your composure and never discuss these perceived rejections with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. If she delays replies, tries to make you jealous, or talks about exes or celebrity crushes, do not engage in discussion about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Recognizing Toxic Behavior

While women's testing can be unconscious, be aware of those who engage in exaggerated testing, such as constantly trying to make you jealous or lying frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If a woman behaves disrespectfully or manipulatively early in the interaction, indicating a "toxic, drama queen" personality, you should walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Engaging in her games to build attraction lowers your standards and attracts similar types of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Setting clear boundaries and maintaining strong standards communicates your self-respect and attracts higher-quality women who share similar desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. You attract what you are, not simply what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Mistake Three: Leaning Before It's Time

Leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction is a sure way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While showing vulnerability can build intimacy, it becomes "emotional suicide" without a proper foundation of certainty and trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Women are naturally nurturing, but their support must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. A high-quality woman will stand by her man if he proves worthy of her support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. However, if you display weakness too early, before establishing your strength, she may perceive it negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This can trigger fear and anxiety in her, leading her to test you to determine if the weakness is an isolated incident or a consistent personality trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

For example, a man who broke down crying early in a budding relationship lost the woman's attraction when he later acquiesced to an unreasonable test (staying up all night for a picture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Had he challenged her request or waited for her to become more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper emotional side, he might not have pushed her away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

In the initial stages of a relationship, many women are not equipped to handle the full range of a man's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. While men desire a woman who accepts them as they are, exposing deep vulnerabilities before a woman has seen your strength and confidence can be counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

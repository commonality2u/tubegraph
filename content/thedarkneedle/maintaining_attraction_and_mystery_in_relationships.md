The concept of [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] in relationships often centers around the idea of a woman chasing the man, rather than the reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While many women might logically state they would never chase someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, women are naturally drawn to men they are pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Understanding the "art of chasing" is key to fostering deeper connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Types of Chasing

There are two distinct types of chasing when it comes to women:

### Logical Chasing

Logical chasing occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear, perceived benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. This interest stems from external factors like wealth or high status, where she believes a relationship would provide financial comfort or gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

However, this type of chasing presents significant issues:
*   **Rarity and Difficulty** It is extremely rare and difficult for most individuals to achieve the level of wealth or status that would consistently attract this type of pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Depth** Relationships based on logical chasing often lack strength and meaning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A woman might be excited by financial success, but her interest is in the money, not the man himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. She will likely remain on the lookout for someone who can fulfill her core emotional needs, which money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This type of chasing is not in a man's best interest if he desires genuine love and for a woman to chase him for who he is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Emotional Chasing

Emotional chasing happens when a woman pursues a man because of her genuine feelings and love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions are beyond her control, and she feels a strong desire to be with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This form of chasing cultivates love, fosters enjoyment in the relationship, and contributes to its longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A woman will not develop deep feelings or true love without this emotional chasing taking place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## The Two Stages of Attraction

The foundation for creating emotional chasing lies in two main stages within a relationship: the hunting stage and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### The Hunting Stage

This initial phase is where the man takes the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As the chooser in the dating market, the man selects the girl he desires and initiates contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

#### Taking Initiative
*   **Initial Contact** The man typically initiates the conversation, takes the first step, and asks for the first date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **[[strategies_for_effective_communication_and_maintaining_attraction_in_dating | Hunter Statements]] vs. Follower Questions** When asking for a date, avoid "follower questions" that put the decision-making power in her hands (e.g., "When can I see you?", "What do you like to do?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Instead, use "hunter statements" that convey confidence and directiveness (e.g., "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. A woman desires a man who knows what to do and acts on it, leading her confidently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

#### Handling Rejection
If a girl declines a date offer with an excuse (e.g., "I have to meet a friend on Sunday"), do not suggest alternative days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Simply respond with "All right, no problem, let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

#### Post-Date Actions
After a date, refrain from sending messages or trying to talk to her immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Take a step back for about a week before messaging her again to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. This system of initiating contact once a week ensures you are taking initiative without chasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If she initiates contact during this phase, it's acceptable to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Continue this pattern until she consistently messages you daily, indicating she has developed feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

#### Date Dynamics
*   **Punctuality** Do not wait more than 10 minutes for a late date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Leaving if she's excessively late holds her accountable and demonstrates that you have other priorities, preventing her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. While some might suggest showing up late on purpose, being on time is generally better as women are increasingly aware of such tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **[[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | Emotional Impact]]** All conversation during the date should aim to have an [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | emotional impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Avoid generic, boring questions like "What do you do for work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Instead, ask questions that emotionally resonate with her, such as recalling exciting memories or discussing important people in her life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The key is to trigger her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Kiss Test** When the conversation reaches a high level of [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | emotional involvement]], perform a kiss test to gauge her readiness for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Ending the Date** End the date at the peak of enjoyment, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Crucially, [[leaving_women_wanting_more_through_mystery_and_intrigue | leave without promising another date]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This strategy helps maintain [[importance_of_mystery_in_relationships | mystery]] and allows her space to think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

### The Chasing Stage

This stage begins when the girl consistently messages you daily, calls you, and expresses a desire to meet frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. At this point, she has transitioned into pursuing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

#### Maintaining Distance (Not Manipulation)
Once she is attached, it's vital not to be constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. If she calls, don't always answer, and if she asks to meet, sometimes say you're busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:11:00]</a>. Making yourself constantly available can lead to boredom and a cooling off of her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. This "distancing" is not manipulation; rather, it provides the [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | challenge]] and [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | drama]] that a woman often desires in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. It allows her to chase and prevents her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. However, this strategy should only be employed once she is already attached; distancing too early will cause her to lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

#### Her Distancing
If a woman distances herself to test if you will chase her, remain calm and do not pursue her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

Ultimately, the goal is to be the hunter, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

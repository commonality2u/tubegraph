To attract women, one of the fastest and most effective methods involves leveraging the human brain's natural tendency to react more strongly to negative stimuli than positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Our brains are programmed to run away from danger more than they are programmed to seek something good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This fundamental principle about how our brains work is key to understanding this attraction strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Power of Shared Dislikes

While finding common interests like a favorite song or movie can be good for breaking the ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, a faster and more effective approach to building attraction is to find something you both dislike or even hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This method has been one of the most effective ways to make women feel a strong attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### Forms of Shared Hatred

Shared hatred can manifest in several ways:

*   **Common Enemy (Concept)**
    A shared hatred can be a common enemy, such as shared disdain for social media and how it makes people superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, or dating apps for ruining relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Historically, a common enemy has been one of the strongest ways to build alliances and attract people to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   **Tip**: A good question to ask a woman is: "What is the thing you hate the most? Who is your enemy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> If you share the same dislike, express it passionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

*   **Shared Dislike of a Person**
    People tend to bond more over those they hate than those they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If you and a woman both dislike the same person—whether a boss, a teacher, or an annoying customer—it can quickly create a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Even if you don't share the same dislike, ask her why she hates them, listen carefully, and observe her passionate and emotional expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

*   **The "Partners in Crime" Dynamic**
    A powerful technique, dubbed "partners in crime," creates a "You and Me Against the World" dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This involves having inside jokes or secretly pranking others together, such as co-workers or certain customers, and later talking negatively about a shared "adversary" like a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This strategy creates an "us against them" vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **Simple Dislikes**
    Shared hatred can also be something as simple as a food you both dislike, a city you find boring, or a TV show or movie you both think is terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Talking about these shared dislikes and expressing your mutual aversion can build a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

This approach of using shared negative emotions is one of the fastest ways to attract someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

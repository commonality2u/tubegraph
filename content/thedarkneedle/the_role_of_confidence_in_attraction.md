Attracting women is described as very easy and simpler than many believe, requiring a return to basic principles rather than superficial tips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Success in attracting women is fundamentally a state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. What is in one's mind reflects in actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Your Internal State Dictates Her Response

A core principle of [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] is "she feels what you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Women judge based on the feelings circulating within a man, not on his looks, words, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

*   **Nervousness and Rejection**: When a man is nervous, there's a high chance of rejection because the woman senses a lack of [[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Confidence and Positive Response**: Conversely, approaching a woman confidently, calmly, and relaxed leads to a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, it's essential to demonstrate that you perceive yourself as a man women naturally desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This relates to [[body_language_and_selfconfidence_in_attracting_women | body language and self-confidence in attracting women]].

## Avoiding the "Approval Seeker" Trap

Many men attempt to win a woman over by pandering to her every whim, often putting her on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This behavior, such as saying things one shouldn't or going out of the way to impress, often masks an inner sense of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The best way to impress a woman is actually by *not* trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. When a man stops seeking her approval, that's when she becomes genuinely impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This is because women are accustomed to men trying to woo them, so an unexpected approach captures their interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. This unexpected behavior introduces an element of [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | uncertainty and unpredictability]] which can be highly attractive.

### The Impact of Seeking Validation

The quest for validation is deeply rooted in self-perception and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Men who constantly seek approval often struggle with low self-esteem, surrendering their power for acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This implies a fear of losing the woman even before a dialogue begins, leading them to engage in actions to avert potential rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

A woman can lose interest almost immediately if she senses a man is craving her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The desperate need for approval is a significant attraction deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Indifference to Outcome

Men who effortlessly attract women do not tie themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. They understand that rejection is an insignificant part of the dating landscape and are not perturbed by a woman's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their primary concern is to enjoy the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. When indifferent to the outcome, a man doesn't fret about the woman's response and focuses on making the most of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. This is part of [[the_role_of_honesty_and_confidence_in_building_connections | honesty and confidence in building connections]].

### Not Valuing Based on Looks

It's a mistake to lose control or award extra points to a woman merely for her looks, as physical attractiveness is not something she necessarily worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Behaving unusually or nervously around an attractive woman can ruin things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

When a man avoids giving extra niceness solely based on her looks, an intriguing phenomenon occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, if a man challenges her perception or makes a statement that implies she might not measure up, she begins to seek *his* validation, as he didn't readily hand it over like the average guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This immediately categorizes him as different and unique, making her genuinely interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This introduces an element of [[the_role_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | mystery and unpredictability]] which fuels [[the_role_of_uncertainty_in_attraction | uncertainty in attraction]].

## High Standards and Self-Worth

A man who truly understands attraction never settles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He always goes for the best and chooses the women he genuinely wants to date, maintaining high standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

A "man of value" puts his principles above all else, even the woman he is with, and is not afraid to step back if his principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Unlike the average guy who might apologize or compromise to prevent a woman from leaving, a high-value man maintains his stance, confident in his worth and knowing there are other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He is not afraid to stand alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Making Her Strive for Attention

People tend to value things they strive hard to obtain more than things given effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This principle applies to relationships: women tend to value men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

It's crucial to learn how to make a woman strive for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Don't be an open book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. A strategy involves showing interest and then quickly showing disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. For example, a high-value man might compliment her but then challenge her, provoking a strong emotional reaction and curiosity about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. When a woman has to work for a man's attention, she becomes incredibly curious because he isn't afraid to challenge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. This emphasizes [[the_role_of_unique_personal_traits_in_attraction | unique personal traits in attraction]].

### Unwavering Authenticity

A common mistake is to modify one's behavior or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, stemming from a fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This sends a message that you view her as higher value and need to change to match that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

The truth is that you shouldn't alter who you are just to make a woman feel at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. If she doesn't appreciate certain aspects, she doesn't deserve you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. If she wants to be with you, she needs to adapt to your reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. A high-value man isn't overly concerned with others' opinions; he shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. He understands there's an abundance of attractive women, so he doesn't fixate on one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

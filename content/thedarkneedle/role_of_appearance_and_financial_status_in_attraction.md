[[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attracting women]] is primarily a skill, not something determined by physical attributes or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Your appearance and financial status play a very small role in creating attraction in a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. As a person, you don't need anything specific to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Debunking Common Misconceptions

Social media often promotes the idea that you need to be tall, go to the gym, have money, or grow a beard to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, this is not accurate. The speaker notes that they were never particularly good-looking and achieved financial stability late in life, yet their success with women "skyrocketed" after studying female psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

Observing couples in public, it's evident that many men with "extremely beautiful women" are not all tall, physically strong, rich, or bearded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Evolutionary Factors, Not Modern Standards

A woman's [[Attracting women and the concept of attraction | attraction]] to a man has evolved due to factors in place for millions of years, unrelated to the modern world's standards of appearance or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. The key for a man is to understand these ancient factors and how women think to be able to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Ultimately, failure with women is not a personal flaw, but rather a lack of knowledge about how to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Changing one's behavior based on understanding female nature is the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

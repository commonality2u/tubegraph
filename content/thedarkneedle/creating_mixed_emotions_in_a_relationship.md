To cultivate deep [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional investment]] and prevent a partner from being unaffected by a separation, it's crucial to make her experience a range of emotions within the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The core principle behind a girl becoming obsessively attached to her partner is the amount of [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional investment]] she puts into the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

To encourage this high level of [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional investment]], two key approaches are necessary when entering a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>:

1.  Being ready to walk away at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>.
2.  Creating a "cocktail of mixed emotions" throughout the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

## Readiness to Walk Away

To be genuinely prepared to leave a relationship, an individual must possess a strong, independent life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. Without a personal life, individuals often become emotionally vulnerable and attached, leading to potential emotional destruction at the end of a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.

### The Pitfalls of a Dull Life
A monotonous life, characterized by unfulfilling work, disliked friends, excessive phone use, and a generally boring routine, makes time spent with a new partner the most enjoyable part of the day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This reliance on the partner for excitement leads to excessive attachment, clinginess, constant communication, and a tendency to seek reconciliation even when the partner is at fault, fearing loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. Such behavior causes the partner to lose respect, viewing you as overly dependent, ultimately leading to separation and emotional devastation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>.

### The Benefits of an Independent Life
Conversely, having a fulfilling personal life—filled with exciting experiences, engaging activities, and strong friendships—makes a relationship an *addition* to an already great life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. This independence ensures that if a relationship ends, the sadness is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>.

In this state, you are fully prepared to walk away if your partner crosses boundaries, making her realize that certain behaviors are unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. While she might accuse you of being "heartless," it's essential to convey that the relationship serves to better your life, and disrespect or disobedience will not be tolerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## The Emotion Cocktail: Making a Relationship a "Movie Story"

While being ready to walk away is powerful, to ensure a partner never experiences the same depth of feeling with another, the relationship should emulate a movie narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>.

### The Power of Film Industry Psychology
The film industry excels at creating deep [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional attachment]] by triggering emotions through a well-defined psychological pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. This proven pattern, also seen in novels, TV series, and marketing, involves:

1.  **Normal State**: Life seems stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
2.  **Problem Arises**: The story escalates due to a conflict or challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:00">[05:35:00]</a>.
3.  **Problem Resolved**: Life returns to normal after the resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.

This structure creates a "roller coaster of mixed emotions," making the individual deeply invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

### The Formula: Stability, Quake, and Magical Reconciliation
Applied to relationships, the emotion cocktail formula involves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>:

1.  **Periods of Stability**: A pleasant routine where both partners feel love and security (e.g., outings, conversations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
2.  **A "Quake"**: A sudden disruption that shakes the partner's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Magical Reconciliation**: An immediate, often cinematic, resolution that restores or even deepens connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.

The stronger the "quake," the more powerful the "magical reconciliation" needs to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

#### Examples:

*   **Paul and Luna**: After a period of stability where Luna valued Paul's honesty, he lied about made-up stories, creating a "quake" of betrayal and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. The "magical reconciliation" occurred when Paul appeared at her university with a gift she wanted and an apology note, resolving the situation and deepening her trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.
*   **Conflict and Reconciliation**: During a stable phase, a conflict leads to separation. If you meet someone else during this time and admit it upon reconciliation, it creates a "quake" of anxiety and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. The "magical reconciliation" could involve a grand gesture, like getting her name tattooed on your forearm, demonstrating intense love, and blocking the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### Who Reconciles After a Quake?
At the beginning of a relationship, especially if you orchestrated the "quake," you should initiate reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. However, once she becomes deeply attached, you can create the "quake" and leave her to reconcile with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. For instance, if she ignores your messages, confront her publicly, raise your voice, and leave as if the relationship is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>. When she realizes you won't make the first move, she will return to make amends, putting you in control to set conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

By applying these methods, it becomes nearly impossible for a partner to consider leaving or seeking another relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

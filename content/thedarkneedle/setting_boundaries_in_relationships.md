Understanding how to [[being_assertive_and_setting_boundaries | set boundaries]] and lead is crucial in relationships, as it appeals to a natural inclination in women to be controlled by a man who can establish dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:13">[09:28:13]</a>. The simplest way to apply this control is by [[setting_boundaries_and_maintaining_standards_in_dating | setting clear boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:22">[09:38:22]</a>.

## How to Establish Boundaries

You must demonstrate that you have limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:45">[09:41:45]</a>.
*   **Respond to undesirable behavior:** If you state a boundary, like "I don't like girls who smoke" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:48">[09:44:48]</a>, and she proceeds to smoke in front of you, you should immediately "get up and walk away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:58">[09:48:58]</a>. Consistently doing this will eventually lead her to stop that behavior in your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:78">[09:51:78]</a>.
*   **Financial expectations:** When planning activities, such as a trip, clearly communicate financial boundaries. For example, state, "I don't pay for girls; we'll split the costs" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:04">[09:57:04]</a>, and then adhere to this boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:64">[09:58:64]</a>.

Regarding who pays the bill, there is no single correct answer; it depends on what you prefer and what works best for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:44">[10:07:44]</a>. The most important thing is to do what makes you comfortable, especially in the early stages of dating when she is not yet your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:09">[10:11:09]</a>. If you can afford to pay, do so; if not, split the bill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:03">[10:18:03]</a>. The key is to prioritize what suits you and not be swayed by her opinion or societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:26">[10:21:26]</a>.

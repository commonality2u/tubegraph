Successfully approaching a woman and getting her contact information requires specific techniques and a confident mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This guide outlines strategies to approach women, overcome the [[dealing_with_fear_of_rejection_in_relationships | fear]] of [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | rejection]], and build [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attraction]].

## Building [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | Confidence]] Before Approaching
Staying calm in all situations is crucial when aiming to [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. If you are relaxed before an approach, things typically go well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Conversely, nervousness can make you appear less [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confident]], potentially leading to [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | rejection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Developing the right [[strategies_for_maintaining_confidence_and_selfworth_in_dating | mindset]] can be challenging, especially for those new to social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Starting Small: Asking for the Time
The most effective way to overcome the [[dealing_with_fear_of_rejection_in_relationships | fear]] of approaching is to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Begin by approaching 10 women daily and simply asking for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To ensure you ask, avoid wearing a watch and turn off your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This exercise boosts your [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]], leading to increased comfort within a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Places
When practicing, select calm environments such as parks, malls, or coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Nightclubs are generally unsuitable for beginners due to high competition, defensive attitudes from women, and loud music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Experiencing [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | rejection]] in clubs can lead to discouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Better options for beginners include hobby classes (yoga, salsa, aerobics), restaurants, coffee shops, public libraries, or malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

### Acting Quickly: The 5-Second Rule
Once you've identified a woman you want to approach, make your move within 5 seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Delaying allows your brain to create excuses, leading to hesitation and potential [[dealing_with_fear_of_rejection_in_relationships | insecurity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Effective Approach Techniques
A common reason for [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | rejection]] is using the wrong approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
*   **Direct Approaches**: Saying things like "Hi, I'm Fred, can I buy you a drink?" often results in quick rejections, such as "My boyfriend is standing over there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Women are often "programmed" to turn down such direct advances, assuming the guy is only seeking casual encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   **Witty Pickup Lines**: Relying on memorized pickup lines is generally ineffective and often leads to more [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | rejections]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
*   **Approaching from the Front**: If she sees you "charging towards her," she will likely put up a "wall of resistance" before you even speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Approaching from Behind**: This can startle women, causing them to instantly avoid you and ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### Getting Her Comfortable
The key to a successful approach is to make her comfortable in your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. If you try too hard, she'll sense a "fishy" motive and raise her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Recommended Approach Angles
*   **Approach from the Side**: This is the most effective method, as it doesn't startle her and prevents her from setting up defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
*   **Non-Threatening Posture**: Walk past her, tilt your head in her direction, and start a [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversation]] over your shoulder, with your chest facing the other direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This open posture makes her more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Starting the [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | Conversation]]
To initiate [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversations]], act in a way that shows you're not explicitly "hitting on" her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Indirect Openers
An effective opener involves pretending to be on the phone and drawing her into a general debate. For example:
1.  Pass by, look over your shoulder, pause, and holding your phone to your ear say, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>
2.  Then, to her, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men. Is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
3.  After her response, hang up and say, "I am in a hurry, but my friend said never to trust anything a female says, half the time she would be lying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>
4.  Engage briefly with her disagreement, then say, "Yeah, I mean, it can't apply to all females." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>
This approach opens the [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversation]] and captures her [[balancing_attention_in_relationships_to_increase_attraction | attention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Stating you're "in a hurry" lowers her defenses and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Observing the Environment
Avoid relying solely on "canned openers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The best way to open [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversations]] is to be as natural as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Restaurant Example**: If she's eating, ask about her dish: "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a> Then mention you're new to the place and ask for suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Commenting on Appearance
In neutral environments, observe what she's wearing and comment on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
*   **Example**: "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on. What's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a> Follow up with, "Yeah, it caught my [[balancing_attention_in_relationships_to_increase_attraction | attention]] that's why I asked you about it. By the way, I'm John." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

### Guessing/Assuming
Instead of directly asking "What do you do?" or "Where do you come from?", make a guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Example**: "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> When she asks why, elaborate: "Well, you have the Californian look about you... Look at the way you're dressed. I have a friend who dresses exactly like you and she is from California too. All you guys tend to dress like Barbie dolls. Why is that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a> This creates an intriguing opening as she'll naturally ask "Why do you say that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Transitioning and Building [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | Attraction]]
Opening [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversations]] is relatively easy, but the challenge lies in transitioning to the next level to spark strong emotional [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

### Applying Learned Techniques
To get her interested, utilize techniques like:
*   The Qualifying Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
*   The Listen Like a Therapist Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   Body Language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   The Push and Pull Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   Mystery (telling a bit and leaving her wanting more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

### [[balancing_attention_in_relationships_to_increase_attraction | The "Talk to Her Friend" Technique]]
When approaching a group, a powerful technique is to talk more to the target's friend than the target herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Most guys focus solely on their target, which makes their interest obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Example**: Say to your target, "Hey, are they your friends?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a> If she says yes, reply, "Be a good girl, introduce me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a> Once introduced, immediately start talking more to one of her friends, completely avoiding the target for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This makes the target curious and causes her to work harder for your [[balancing_attention_in_relationships_to_increase_attraction | attention]], creating a sense of jealousy and intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | Physical Touch]]
Integrating playful [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | physical touch]] can significantly amplify the impact of your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Nails**: Stare at her hands, then gently grab her fingers and say, "Oh, nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>
*   **Forehead**: Stare at her forehead and say, "You have something on your forehead." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a> When she asks what, do a slight cleanup with your fingers and say, "Okay, all clean now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>
*   **Hair**: Stare at her hair and say, "Wow, nice color, or how did you get it curly like that? Is this real hair?" Then touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **High Five**: Say, "You are cool, just like me. We will make a great team. Give me a high five," and then give a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

If she allows you to touch her once, her defenses are lowered, making her more receptive to further [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | physical escalation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Getting Her Number
If you've built enough [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attraction]], getting her number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The "What I Noticed" Technique
1.  During a good [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversation]], transition into an interesting story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.
2.  While telling the story, say, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," then continue your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  Keep her curious and tell her you'll share after the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
4.  When the story ends and she asks again, check the time and say, "Oh, I'm running late, I have to go." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
5.  Hand her your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>
This approach creates interest in continuing the [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | conversation]] and ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Providing a Motive
Always provide a motive for her to give you her number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Example**: "My friends are having this party on Saturday, it's one of the coolest events which happens only once a year. I have free passes, you should come." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a> Then hand her your phone: "Here, punch in your number. I'll let you know the timings." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>
Randomly asking "Can I have your phone number?" often leads to [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | rejection]] or her forgetting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Handling [[dealing_with_rejection_in_dating_and_life | Rejection]] When Asking for a Number
*   **Incorrect Number**: If she gives a wrong number, you can call it to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. If it's wrong, say, "Oh, playing aren't we?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a> If she apologizes and offers to correct it, say, "No, never mind, I don't want it. It was great meeting you," and walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Total Refusal**: If she totally refuses, it indicates you haven't built enough [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. You can try once more with "Come on, giddy up, I don't have much time here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a> If she still refuses, say a friendly goodbye and walk off immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Exiting After Getting the Number
The moment you get her phone number, leave the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Lingering can make it awkward and potentially reverse the [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attraction]] you've built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

Losing a woman's respect is often the fastest way to lose the woman herself, and sometimes, your own self-worth in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Many common mistakes men make can stem from or exacerbate a fear of rejection, ultimately preventing them from gaining a woman's respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Mistakes to Avoid

### 1. Not Distinguishing Between Seeking Approval and Seeking Advice

Women inherently enjoy helping and offering support, which is a strong way for them to bond emotionally with someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Asking a woman for advice can quickly create a connection, whether short-term or long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, many men fall into the trap of asking for advice in a way that suggests they are actually [[understanding_and_addressing_neediness_in_relationships | seeking approval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

The problem isn't the act of asking for an opinion, especially in a relationship where consulting your partner makes sense, particularly if the decision affects both of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. The issue lies in the underlying reason for asking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Many men ask not to hear her opinion, but to be reassured that their decision is correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Phrases like "What do you think if I go out with the guys tonight?" or "Do you think I should accept this opportunity?" often hide a deeper question: "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

When a man makes decisions based on how a woman will react, he is no longer acting on his own values and principles, but out of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Women quickly notice this shift, sometimes even before the man does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The moment your decisions are based on pleasing her, she becomes the center of your life, and her respect for you begins to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This behavior also makes you easier to manipulate and more predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Instead of asking out of fear of her reaction, genuinely ask for her opinion because you value it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Your decisions regarding your own life, such as travel or spending time with friends, should not be based on her happiness or require her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

#### Leadership in Shared Decisions

When it comes to decisions involving both partners, a man's leadership is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, if you suggest going to the movies and she proposes going to the pool, yielding to her makes her the leader and causes you to lose her respect and your own leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

To maintain leadership, you should refuse to go to the pool and reiterate your desire to go to the movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If she persists, respectfully state that you won't go to the pool, but she is welcome to go, while you proceed with your original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Over time, this consistent leadership will lead her to accept and follow you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Her emotions should not dictate your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>; she desires you to be a strong leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### 2. Sending the Message That You Expect Rejection

A common mistake is demonstrating an expectation of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This can manifest by reacting to situations like a girl posting a picture with another guy or not replying to your message by addressing these incidents with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Doing so signals that you anticipate her rejection, leading you to invent negative scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Women, universally, like to give the impression that you haven't fully impacted them yet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. While she might show interest, she will not reveal early on that she is emotionally attached or desires a serious relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This behavior is often an unconscious test to see if you will lose confidence in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

If you become upset because she didn't respond, you inadvertently grant her more power over you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Women are drawn to strength, so you need to demonstrate power in this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

#### [[strategies_for_maintaining_confidence_and_selfworth_in_dating | Maintaining Confidence]]

Whenever a girl rejects you or tries to give the impression she doesn't want you, understand that she is likely testing your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Do not discuss these actions with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. If she delays replies, tries to make you jealous, or talks about an ex or celebrity crush, do not focus on it or engage in discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

While these actions are often unconscious, be particularly aware of women who exhibit such testing behaviors excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If a woman consistently tries to make you jealous or lies, especially early in the interaction, this may signal a toxic, manipulative, or "drama queen" personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

If she tests you disrespectfully or tactlessly, especially when there's no established relationship, it's a sign to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Playing into her manipulative games might build attraction temporarily, but it lowers your standards and attracts similar types of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Setting clear boundaries and having strong standards signals that you know what you want and are prepared to walk away from anything that doesn't align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Manipulative men attract drama queens, and "nice guys" attract bossy, controlling, or gold-digging women because they lack boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Focus on attracting what you are, not just what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### 3. Leaning on Her Before She's Invested

Seeking [[providing_reassurance_and_emotional_support_to_exploit_fear_of_failure | emotional support]] and security from a woman before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction for you is a guaranteed way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While vulnerability can foster intimacy, it's "emotional suicide" if a proper foundation of trust and certainty hasn't been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Women are naturally nurturing, but this support must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. A high-quality woman will support her man through challenges if he has proven himself worthy of that support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If you show weakness too early, before she is sure about you, it will be perceived as a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This can trigger fear and anxiety in her, potentially leading her to test you to determine if this weakness is an isolated incident or a recurring part of your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

> [!example] The Funeral Casket Example
> A woman recounted how, in high school, a young man she was interested in cried in front of her while discussing his father's casket at the funeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Despite her sympathy, she felt unsettled by his emotional display, having seen his weakness too early in their budding relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Days later, when he asked for her photo, wanting to give him a second chance, she tested him by asking him to stay up all night waiting for a specific song on the radio as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He fell for the trap and did as she asked, leading her to lose all attraction and break up with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited until she was more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper side, she wouldn't have pushed him away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

In the early stages of a relationship, some women are not ready to handle the full range of a man's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While men desire a woman who accepts them as they are, exposing your vulnerabilities to a woman who hasn't yet witnessed your strength and confidence can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

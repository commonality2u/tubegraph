In relationships, particularly with women, men generally face three archetypes: the "nice guy," the "bad boy," and the "half bad half nice" individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The "nice guy" often fails with women, typically ending up in the [[the_pitfalls_of_being_overly_nice | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The "bad boy" attracts women who chase him, but his life may be marked by frequent breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The ideal approach is to embody the "half bad half nice" persona, referred to as "the gentleman," which can make women fall deeply in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## Human Nature and Perception

Our brains naturally pay attention to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This principle applies to all social relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

*   **The "White Page, Black Spot" Analogy**: If you are always serving or kind to people (like a white page), a single mistake or refusal (a black spot) will cause them to focus only on that negative exception, overshadowing all the good deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Their resentment can grow with each mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
*   **The "Black Page, White Spot" Analogy**: Conversely, a person who is not naturally kind but performs one good deed will be widely praised and seen as a great person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This is due to human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.
*   **Applying to Women**: If a man is always nice to a woman, she won't see his kindness as special or appreciate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, if he behaves normally or indifferently and occasionally does something nice, these gestures will stand out, making them more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
    *   A "nice guy" is "always white" with occasional "black dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   A "half bad half nice" man is "black" with occasional "white dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

When a man is not naturally nice but behaves normally or indifferently, a woman may perceive him as a high-value individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. His lack of excessive niceness is interpreted as confidence and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When such a man then does something kind, it is seen as an exception and is remembered for days, weeks, or even a lifetime, increasing her attraction and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Practical Application: Two Fundamental Points

To be a high-value man without being overly nice yet still being a gentleman, focus on two key areas: attention and requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### 1. Attention

A common misconception is that women love constant attention, or conversely, that one should never give attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For long-term, healthy relationships, a balance is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Attention should not be given all the time; there must be a balance between presence and absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When you give attention, you must stop afterward to prevent it from losing its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The decision to give attention depends on the emotions involved and their cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>:

*   **Woman feels negative emotions because of *you***: Give attention.
    *   *Examples*: She feels jealous because you talked to another woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, or she is angry/crying due to your mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   **You feel negative emotions because of *her***: Do *not* give attention.
    *   *Examples*: She talks to another guy, posts a picture hugging another man, or smokes despite knowing you dislike it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
    *   Do not show anger or effect; [[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | ignore the situation]] completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Showering her with compliments in such situations shows jealousy and fear of loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Reply normally if she messages, but do not give extra attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Woman feels positive emotions because of *you***: Do *not* give too much attention.
    *   *Examples*: You took her to a nice place or did something that made her happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    *   Since her happiness likely stemmed from attention you already gave, continuous attention would lose its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. For instance, after an expensive dinner, do not text her at night; simply disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **You feel positive emotions because of *her***: Give attention.
    *   *Examples*: She wears an attractive outfit, does something enjoyable in bed, or buys you a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Woman feels positive or negative emotions *not because of you***: Remain neutral and do not give attention.
    *   *Examples*: She's in a bad mood due to work or family issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
    *   Avoid the mistake of immediately trying to cheer her up with flowers or outings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. If you constantly give attention when she feels bad, she will place you in the "therapy zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. If she is your girlfriend, listen and talk kindly, but avoid excessive attention or overdoing help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

### 2. Requests

When dealing with a woman's requests, there are two types: those given as tests (to see if you're strong or easily [[consequences_and_ethics_of_manipulative_behaviors_in_relationships | manipulated]]) and genuine requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

*   **Case 1: Direct Orders (Tests)**:
    *   These are often used in early interactions to gauge if you're accustomed to being around attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
    *   *Examples*: "Hold this for me," "Wait here," "Take her picture," "Give me a kiss on the cheek," or "Go buy me something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   **Response**:
        *   If the request is inconvenient or makes no sense (e.g., "Go buy me something"), you must refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
        *   If the request doesn't bother you but is still a test (e.g., "Take our picture"), do not accept directly. Instead, accept on *your own terms* by taking control and setting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
            *   *Example*: If asked to "Take our picture," respond with "Okay, but I want you to give me your best silly sexy gangster face, ready, go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This subtly shifts the [[balancing_power_with_charisma | power dynamic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

*   **Case 2: Indirect Expressions of Feelings (Genuine Desires)**:
    *   Women often mention things they like instead of making direct requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
    *   *Examples*: "I love the beach," "I love pizza," "I love this restaurant" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
    *   **Response**: Employ [[balancing_availability_and_absence | delaying]]. Take note of what she likes, but don't immediately act on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Surprise her by fulfilling her wishes weeks later at unexpected moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
    *   This strategy shows thoughtfulness without appearing overly eager, submissive, or weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It also makes you unpredictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   By doing this, she learns that she gets what she wants when *you* decide to give it, rather than when she demands or complains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Maintaining [[significance_of_maintaining_boundaries_and_principles | boundaries]] and being firm is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

By applying these principles of managing attention and handling requests, a man can be nice without losing his masculinity, achieving the desired "half bad half nice" balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. This approach contributes to a strong [[main_character_mindset_in_relationships | main character mindset]] and highlights [[the_importance_of_virtues_and_character | virtuous behavior]] in relationships.

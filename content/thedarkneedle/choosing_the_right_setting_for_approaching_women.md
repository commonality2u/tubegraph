## Building Initial Confidence

For those new to [[approaching_women_in_public | approaching women]] or needing to [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | build confidence]], it's recommended to start with low-stakes interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

*   **Simple Exercise**: [[approaching_women_in_public | Approach]] 10 women each day and simply ask for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

This exercise can significantly boost your confidence within a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   **Ideal Spots**: For this exercise, opt for calm places like parks, malls, or coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Avoid**: Nightclubs are generally not the best idea for this specific exercise due to their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Places to Avoid (Especially for Beginners)

Clubs and bars, while common for meeting people, often present significant challenges for beginners in [[approaching_women_in_public | approaching women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Nightclubs can lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a> and discouragement due to:

> *   **Loud Music**: It's difficult to have a proper conversation over the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Recommended Settings for Approaches

Instead of nightclubs, consider places that offer a more relaxed atmosphere and better opportunities for genuine interaction.

*   **Hobby Classes**: Options like yoga, salsa dancing, or aerobics classes are great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

*   **Casual Public Spaces**:
    *   Restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
    *   Coffee Shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
    *   Public Libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>
    *   Malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>

### Adapting Your Opener to the Environment

[[the_formula_for_effective_conversation_with_women | Effective conversation]] starters often leverage the immediate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

*   **Restaurant Example**: If you're in a restaurant, you can ask about what she's eating or drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
    > "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
    > "I'm new to this place and can't really figure out what to order. I think I should order this dish. Is there anything else you can suggest?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   **Neutral Environment**: If there's nothing specific to comment on in a neutral setting, observe what she's wearing and comment on that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    > "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on. What's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
    > "Yeah, it caught my attention that's why I asked you about it. By the way, I'm John." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>

[[importance_of_social_skills_for_success | Social skills]] are presented as the "key to life itself" and the most important skill one can possess, crucial for success across various fields, from CEOs and company executives to world leaders and even starting a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. An article cited suggests that [[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | communication skills]] alone account for 85% of success in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

The foundational concept upon which all [[understanding_social_skills_through_psychology | social skills]] are built is a deeply ingrained human instinct: a "hunger for value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Humans desire to feel that they have value in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Satisfying this hunger in the right way is key to winning people over and gaining their cooperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This concept of providing "food for the instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a> is demonstrated through a personal anecdote where a math tutor's positive manipulation motivated a student to excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

It is emphasized that [[social_skills_comparison | social skills]] are a skill that needs practice and improvement, much like quitting smoking or going to the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. The advice to "be yourself" is deemed "the dumbest, worst, and most absurd piece of advice" when it hinders personal growth and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

## Techniques for Improving Social Skills

### 1. Make Them Feel They Impressed You
A golden rule in [[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication | social skills]] is that to leave an impression and influence someone, you must make them feel they left an impression and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of trying to show how amazing you are, show them how amazing and remarkable *they* are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

This is achieved through **focused conversation**:
*   **Let them talk about themselves and build on what they say.** For instance, if they recount an experience, keep the focus on them by asking "what did you do about it?" or "how did the date go?" instead of shifting to your own similar experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This requires active listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Redirect a general topic towards them.** For example, when discussing the weather, ask "what do you like more, rain or sunshine? Summer or winter?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

By making them the center of the conversation, you give them value, satisfy their instinct, and make them feel influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

### 2. Don't Try to Prove Anything
A display of [[confidence_in_social_interactions | strength]] and value is not trying to prove anything to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. When others sense you don't need to assert yourself, they will feel the need to prove themselves to *you*, which increases your value in their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

*   **Handling Interruptions:** If someone interrupts you or changes the subject, often the best approach is to ignore it and let them talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Don't insist on returning to your previous topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Constant Interruptions:** If someone consistently interrupts, calmly and directly tell them, "Why don't you let me finish what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. If they persist, there's no reason to continue engaging with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Direct Communication:** Especially for men, society expects clear and direct expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Avoid indirect communication out of fear of seeming rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Avoid needless corrections:** Do not correct trivial or inconsequential facts unless it adds meaningful value to the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### 3. Recognize Their Presence as a Person
Accept and value individuals for who they are, not for what they have or do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Avoid superficial questioning:** Do not ask questions about their job, education, or income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The person should feel you care about them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Refrain from unsolicited advice or lecturing:** Do not give advice or tell people they need to change unless they explicitly ask for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. People usually already know their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Never place yourself above others:** Do not assume a higher position and give advice or tell people what to do. Don't embarrass them or try to help without being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### 4. Give Them Opportunity to Earn Your Admiration
Encourage others to strive for your admiration by asking for their opinions and suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **Ask for and listen to their opinions:** Most people are focused on expressing their own opinions. Learn to ask for and truly listen to others' thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Receive suggestions gracefully:** When someone offers advice or suggestions, listen to them. Do not immediately reject their advice or treat them as if they don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
*   **Never look down on anyone:** Treat everyone as your equal, regardless of their education or age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Graceful rejection:** If a suggestion isn't suitable, respond diplomatically, such as "that seems like a good idea but I need to think about it," instead of an outright rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

The moment someone starts trying to gain your admiration, it signifies you have already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This applies to all relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

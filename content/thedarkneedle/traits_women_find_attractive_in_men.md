A key secret to attracting women is the "Rock technique," which revolves around being non-reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. A rock does not react to external stimuli, such as yelling or hitting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Similarly, a man should be someone who doesn't react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Psychology Behind Non-Reactiveness
Women are subconsciously seeking a man with "survival capabilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. While we live in a modern world, our primal ancestors' mindset still influences us <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. A crucial trait for a "Survivor" is composure and being unaffected by anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Primal ancestors who reacted too much would not have survived turbulent lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Despite modern life, women still carry a gene that seeks a non-reactive man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. This is why women are often attracted to movie characters with a cold demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. If asked about the quality men have that women can't resist, it would be non-reactiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

To make a woman attached, you need to trigger a range of emotions, including the sense of non-reactivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. If she doesn't feel this, she won't be attracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This principle is part of [[understanding_female_attraction | understanding female attraction]] and [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | the psychology of women's attraction]].

## Practical Applications of Non-Reactiveness

### Communication and Rejection
Women often test if they can affect your behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Unanswered Messages:** If you send a message and she doesn't reply, do not send another message immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Sending more messages shows you reacted to her silence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. If she doesn't reply, just relax <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Date Rejection:** If she rejects a date, do not ask why or react negatively (e.g., "no problem we can go out another time" with excessive talking, or aggressive statements like "do you think you're the only girl in the world") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This shows you are reactive and not like a rock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Never ask a girl the reason for her decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Your response should be calm and composed, like "all right, another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This gives her the feeling you aren't overly interested and increases her desire to go out with you next time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. This demonstrates [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | personality traits to attract women]].

### Physical Interactions
*   **Initiating Touch:** If you touch her hand and she pulls it away, don't show any reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Remove your hand calmly and wait for another opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Touch is important for connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, and as a man, you should introduce touch by the second day at most (e.g., holding her hand, hand on shoulder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. If she moves your hand away, it's normal; just try again later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Moderation in Touch:** Don't overdo physical touch, especially at the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Touch briefly, remove your hand, wait, and touch again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Reciprocal Touch:** If she touches you after previously pulling away, don't get overly excited or cling to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Kiss Rejection:** If you try to kiss her and she turns her face away, apply the same principle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. Stay calm, act naturally, and don't show any response or ask why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### Showing Non-Neediness
When a girl realizes you don't "need" her, you have won her over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. Don't get upset, angry, or show any reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. If she wants to leave your place, let her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### When to React
The only situation where you *should* react and stop a girl is when she disrespects you (e.g., insults, curses, disrespectful behavior) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This is not the same as a simple rejection of a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

### Maintaining Your Identity
Never change yourself based on a woman's request unless you are genuinely convinced it's for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. If a girl asks you to change something, it's often her way of testing your strength and seeing if you are a "strong high value man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This is actually a sign she is attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Your response should be, "This is who I am. If you want me, great; if not, goodbye" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

## Dealing with a Woman's Fluctuating Mood
A woman's psychology is driven by hormones and emotions, making her mood constantly fluctuate like a zigzag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. You cannot control a woman's mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Be a Rock:** If her mood is erratic, you must remain steady and stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Don't change your mood to match hers, or try to change her feelings (e.g., don't try to cheer her up if she's angry, or make her laugh excessively if she's sad) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.
*   **Let Feelings Pass:** Let her experience her emotions, and they will eventually pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. You, however, should always stay calm and happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. When she sees that her mood doesn't affect you, her emotions and instincts will feel an extraordinary [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attraction]] to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This is essential for [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | understanding women's respect and attraction]].

## Handling General Rejection
This principle of non-reactiveness also applies to rejection in life generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Avoid Emotional Reactivity:** If a girl can put you in a highly emotional state, it means you have "high emotional reactivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Internal Self-Worth:** This also indicates your sense of self-worth comes from an external source (the girl's response) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. If your self-worth is tied to her responses, it directly kills [[understanding_male_and_female_attraction | attraction]] because women don't want a man they can easily manipulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Don't Take It Personally:** If you take rejection personally and dwell on it for days, you are in a highly reactive state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. The reason for the rejection might be that she sensed your reactivity and dependence on her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Key is Response:** The key is not to change her reaction, but to learn how to deal with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Understand that she is just one person, and her rejection doesn't mean every girl will do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Do not let it affect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

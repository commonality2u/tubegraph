The key to making a woman "obsessed, addicted, and love you" is to create "drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Drama is what stimulates a woman's emotions, causing her to think about you constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This concept serves as a "recipe" for her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Understanding Emotional Triggers
A woman is an emotional being, driven by feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. To make her love you, you must stir her emotions in a specific way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. There are eight specific feelings that, when experienced with you, will cause her brain to release love hormones, fostering attachment and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

### Be the Source of Emotions
It is crucial that you are the *source* of the emotions she feels, not just an external trigger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. External emotions, such as feeling the atmosphere of a beautiful place or being moved by a film, do not create [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] to *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, if a movie makes her emotional, she will be attracted to the movie, not to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. These emotions must be woven into your conversations and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Ingredients for Attraction

### 1. Excitement
Excitement is generated by combining attention with a touch of indifference in your conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This means alternating between complimenting and critiquing her in an emotionally stirring way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Compliments and Critiques:** Avoid direct, flat statements like "This dress doesn't look good on you" or "You look beautiful in this dress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **The Right Approach:** Show interest, then add a hint of disinterest without being completely uninterested or overly attentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Example (Interest then Indifference):** "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This shows interest without appearing to chase her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
    *   **Example (Indifference then Interest):** "If this dress were pink, it would be better, but still it looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **The Primacy/Recency Effect:** Humans tend to remember the last thing said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. By ending with a positive or rising emotion, you create excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. For instance, "You're so short, but still you're adorable" creates an emotional dip followed by a rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
*   **When to Show Full Attention:** It's acceptable to show complete attention when she does something you explicitly like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example, if you said you like green and she wears a green shirt, saying "This shirt looks great on you" is fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### 2. Being Enjoyable to Spend Time With
Every time she thinks of you, she should associate you with exciting and fun thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

*   **Mindset Shift:** Instead of trying too hard to make her laugh or entertain her (which can lead to being "just a friend"), focus on enjoying your time yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. Be positive, relaxed, and spontaneous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Say and act as you want, and don't overthink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The "golden rule" is that for her to enjoy being with you, you must enjoy yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Talk About Your Passions:** Your emotions are reflected in hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. When you discuss topics you love, your joy and enthusiasm will be contagious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Your passion can make any subject engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Turn Negativity into Positivity:**
    1.  Notice a flaw or negative aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    2.  Point it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    3.  Transform it into something positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   **Example:** If she wears heavy makeup, you could say, "Do you always wear this much makeup or is it just for special occasions?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. After her response, immediately follow up with, "Don't worry, you still look cute with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This often elicits laughter and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

### 3. Curiosity and Desire
This is created through two main techniques:

*   **Unfinished Conversation:** Spark her intense interest, and just as excitement peaks, pull back, leaving her eager for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Examples:**
        *   "Oh, I completely forgot, I was supposed to tell you something really important. Wait, I have to make an important phone call, I'll tell you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
        *   "I've noticed something fascinating and strange about you, do you know what it is?" When she asks, reply, "Well, I'll tell you later, now's not the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
        *   Leaving an incomplete story: "Do you know there are two habits I hate in women? The first habit is that most women don't say what they mean and don't mean what they say." Then go silent. When she asks about the second habit, reply, "Well, I don't think you're ready to hear it yet, I'll tell you when you're ready," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
    *   This technique makes her wait, increasing her excitement, curiosity, and desire, which in turn leads to her thinking about you all day and creating a strong sense of [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

*   **Strategic Ending of Dates:**
    *   Leave the date without revealing your feelings for her, especially early on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   End the date when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having fun, rather than letting it become dull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
    *   Do not promise another meeting (e.g., "Let's meet again" or "I'll call you") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This maintains mystery, making her wonder if you enjoyed your time and why you didn't ask for another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This confusion keeps you in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

### 4. Mystery and Uncertainty
This feeling complements curiosity and is crucial for [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracting women]].

*   **Never Show You "Want" Her Too Early:** Avoid revealing your feelings too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Contrary to movies, telling a girl you love her early on will instantly kill her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Her uncertainty about your feelings is a primary factor that fuels her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   **Maintain Mystery:** Don't give away too much information about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
    *   **Example (Bad):** If asked "Where do you work?", replying "I work at XYZ" signals low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
    *   **Example (Good):** "Guess, and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. If she doesn't guess, it creates an aura of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   **Other Examples:**
        *   Her: "What are you doing Saturday night?" You: "Something fun, but it's a secret, sorry I can't tell you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
        *   Her: "Have you ever been in a relationship before?" You: "I don't know you well enough yet, I don't share personal things with strangers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   While mystery should decrease over time, always maintain some degree of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Keep her wondering what you're up to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

### 5. Jealousy
This is one of the most important emotions a woman should feel for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

*   **Before a Serious Relationship:** If she asks if you're dating other women, admit it by saying, "Yes, there are a few girls I go out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This not only sparks jealousy but also motivates her to work harder to keep you, as she knows you have other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **In an Exclusive Relationship:** It's still important for her to feel some jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Occasionally talk to other women or have female friends you hang out with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. If she expresses jealousy, reassure her that despite this, she is the one who truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   Women enjoy competition and feeling like the winner, which makes them see you as a prize and increases their attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### 6. Safety
A girl will not enter a physical relationship unless she feels comfortable and safe with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

*   **Authenticity:** The most essential tip for creating safety is to ensure what you present aligns with your true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. If your words don't match your personality, you'll come across as fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Never go against your nature to please a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Being honest with your personality makes her sense trustworthiness and genuineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Creating Security (Example):** When watching a horror movie together, if she feels scared and clings to you, and you remain unafraid, she will feel a sense of security and safety with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

### 7. Respect (Through Disagreement)
Don't be afraid to engage in debates or disagreements from time to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

*   **Avoid Being a "Yes Man":** If you always play by her rules and agree with everything she says, you signal that you don't know how to demand respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. This suggests you fear losing her and lack self-belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>.
*   **The Myth of Disagreement:** Many men falsely believe women hate men who disagree with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
*   **Seek Challenge:** Women seek a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. You will not be a challenge if you agree with everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

## The Overall "Recipe"
A good mix of all these emotions is the perfect recipe for long-term [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Avoid letting any single emotion dominate, as this can become boring and lead to her losing attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. To evoke these emotions, you need to be unpredictable in everything you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Always keep her guessing about your next move and maintain a slight sense of mystery and unpredictability in your conversations and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

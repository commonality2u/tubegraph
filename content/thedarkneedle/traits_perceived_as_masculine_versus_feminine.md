The foundation of attraction between a man and a woman is based on the principle of "Opposites Attract" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This concept suggests that for "sexual electricity" to be generated, there must be a polarity, similar to how a battery requires positive and negative sides to create an electric charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. If two individuals are too similar, like two negatives or two positives, attraction will not be generated; instead, this similarity leads to friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Most men mistakenly interpret "Opposites Attract" in a shallow way, assuming it only refers to physical differences, such as a man being attracted to a woman for her physical traits, or a woman being attracted to a taller man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. However, this principle is much deeper and forms the core of [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | women's attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

## Societal Changes and Gender Roles

Historically, the distinction between masculine and feminine traits was naturally understood and exhibited; "men were men and women were women" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. However, modern societal changes, including equality, feminism, and social media, have reshaped society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. These changes have caused men to lose their natural essence and masculinity, leading them to believe they need to be nice and find common ground with women to attract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Despite these changes impacting men, [[understanding_womens_psychology | women's natural essence]] as emotional beings has not changed; they do not control their actions through logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Therefore, for a man to be attractive, he needs to return to his natural state, embracing masculine traits that naturally make him the opposite of a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Key Feminine Traits and Masculine Counterparts

To foster attraction, a man must embody traits that are the complete opposite of a woman's natural characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Indecisiveness (Feminine) vs. Decisiveness (Masculine)

*   **Feminine Trait:** Indecisiveness is a common feminine trait, exemplified by a woman spending a long time deciding what to wear or order at a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Masculine Counterpart:** When a man shows indecisiveness, a woman loses trust in his ability to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. A man must be decisive, know what he wants, and make quick decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. It is crucial to stick to decisions, even if a woman suggests changing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Romanticism (Feminine) vs. Non-Romantic (Masculine)

*   **Feminine Trait:** Romanticism is a purely feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Women naturally express affection and say sweet things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. While women may claim they desire a romantic man, a man acting overly romantic often leads to a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Masculine Counterpart:** Men are naturally attracted to romantic women, but should not be romantic themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. While occasional romantic gestures are acceptable, a man should never be the primary source of romance in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. He should enjoy a romantic atmosphere created by her, but avoid initiating it himself or showering her with love words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Jealousy (Feminine) vs. Detachment (Masculine)

*   **Feminine Trait:** Jealousy is a feminine trait; a man will find a woman's jealousy attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Women may even unconsciously try to provoke jealousy in men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   **Masculine Counterpart:** For a man, jealousy is strictly forbidden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He must never show a woman that he is jealous, ask about other people she talks to, or monitor her actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Instead, he should act as if he doesn't care at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. If a woman is cheating, the appropriate response is to end the relationship immediately, not to act possessive or monitor her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Suppressing jealousy increases a woman's attachment and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Reaction (Feminine) vs. Action (Masculine)

*   **Feminine Trait:** A woman is primarily a "reaction," meaning she is the one who should react to a man's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. She might get angry, sad, or happy due to his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Masculine Counterpart:** A man must be the "action" and never react to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. If her actions can provoke a reaction from him, she is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. He should remain calm and unaffected, even in frustrating situations like unexpected rain or a full restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. The only exception is when his respect is challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Emotional (Feminine) vs. Rational (Masculine)

*   **Feminine Trait:** A woman is an emotional being, often moody, and her desires can change quickly based on how she feels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. For example, her craving for food might switch abruptly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. In an emergency, a woman might panic and talk fast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Masculine Counterpart:** A man is a rational being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. His decisions should be based on logic, not fleeting emotions or moods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. He does what needs to be done, not just what he feels like doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. This is why women are attracted to men who make rational choices, such as eating healthy food even if it's not the tastiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Even if a man isn't naturally self-improving, he should appear to be rational in front of a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. In an emergency, a man should remain calm, inspect the situation, and discuss it rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Excessive Concern with Appearance (Feminine) vs. Simplicity (Masculine)

*   **Feminine Trait:** Caring about physical appearance has historically been associated with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Women are "supposed to care about her appearance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Masculine Counterpart:** Recently, men have become overly focused on their looks, competing to wear stylish clothes and excessive accessories, which is a feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. A man needs to focus on only three things to improve his appearance: regular exercise, simple clothes with basic accessories, and good personal hygiene (fragrance, grooming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Spending more than five minutes a day looking in the mirror leads to a lack of respect from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Even if a man enjoys taking care of his looks, he should not overtly display this to a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

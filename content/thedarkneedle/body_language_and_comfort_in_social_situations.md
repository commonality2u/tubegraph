When interacting with others, particularly in dating scenarios, the way one carries themselves, including [[body_language_and_its_impact_on_conversation | body language]] and comfort, plays a crucial role in how they are perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. A primary issue many individuals face is being ignored, which often stems from a fundamental problem in their behavior and approach to social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This problem is not typically related to financial status or physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## The Problem of Effort and Neediness

When someone likes a beautiful person, they instinctively want that person to like them back, leading them to make an effort to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. This effort involves stepping out of one's natural self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. For example, while at home one might be relaxed and natural, if a girl is present, they might suddenly become alert, adjusting their posture or speaking in a specific way to appear special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

The underlying reason for making an effort is a perceived "need" for something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. In social interactions, making an effort implies a need for the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This "neediness" is considered the number one killer of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Neediness isn't expressed verbally but is felt by others when they observe someone making an excessive effort to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This feeling of neediness is what causes people to be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

To avoid being ignored, one must not be needy, which means stopping the effort to impress, and ultimately, remaining in their natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The moment someone steps out of their natural self, others may begin to ignore them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. Conversely, individuals who are just being themselves often find that others are attracted to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.

## Strategies for Natural Behavior and Comfort

To cultivate a natural and comfortable presence, consider the following rules:

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Others' Opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
This involves being oneself and doing what one wants, similar to how one would act around a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The fear of appearing silly or caring too much about others' opinions can prevent natural behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. When one acts naturally, others perceive that comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Examples include:
*   Playfully tapping someone on the head with a water bottle and saying "Sh" during banter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This shows a lack of concern for their opinion and demonstrates genuine enjoyment of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   Asking for a small favor and then patting their head, saying "Good girl," as if they were a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This signifies doing what comes to mind without concern for their standards or thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   Reacting humorously to minor setbacks or mistakes (e.g., calling someone "stupid" for a low exam score or laughing if they fell, in an appropriate context) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   Maintaining personal habits, such as smoking, even if it slightly inconveniences another person, rather than immediately changing behavior to accommodate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. The focus should be on enjoying one's time without caring about the outcome or seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
This applies to how one plans dates or presents themselves.
*   **Date Locations**: Choose places one would typically go with a friend, especially for early dates, such as parks or familiar cafes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Taking someone to a place where staff know you implies they are an addition to your usual life, not a reason to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   **Attire**: Dress normally and simply, focusing on personal comfort rather than elaborate outfits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This conveys relaxation and a lack of effort to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Authenticity**: Don't try to prove critics wrong or fake abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. Be honest about flaws or things one doesn't know how to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Avoid trying to meet unrealistic standards set by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Instead, turn such situations into a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 3. Never Compete for Attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>
Entering a competition for someone's approval indicates neediness, insecurity, and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
*   **Group Settings**: In social gatherings, avoid trying to tell better jokes, look stronger, or have more exciting stories than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Remain calm and natural, as if there are no observers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Elevate Others**: One of the most powerful ways to impress is to appreciate and elevate the value of other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. If someone tells a joke or shares an impressive story, genuinely laugh, clap, or highlight their value, rather than trying to outdo them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Girls notice when someone is rude to others to stand out, perceiving it as an attempt to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. A man who doesn't compete is seen as [[honesty_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | confident]] and self-sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jealousy**: If a person you like is with someone else, avoid asking about them or seeking details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Showing [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | confidence]] by introducing a partner to a more attractive friend can indicate high self-assurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>.

### 4. Reflect Comfort in Body Language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>
[[Body language and its impact on conversation | Body language]] should primarily reflect comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Avoid overthinking specific postures; simply be comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Whether hands are in pockets, on the head, or leaning back, as long as the position is comfortable, it conveys the right message <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. When walking, move naturally and comfortably, rather than in an overly deliberate or exaggerated manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

The core principle is to understand that one does not need the other person, even if they like them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. By adopting these behaviors, one will project an aura of not needing to impress, ensuring they are not ignored because they never gave the other person a chance to ignore them in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

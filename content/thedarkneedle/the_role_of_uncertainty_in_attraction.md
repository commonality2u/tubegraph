To capture a woman's attention and affection, the most effective method is to make her think about you for extended periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This continuous thought process is achieved through two "keys": uncertainty and managing expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The First Key: Uncertainty

Uncertainty is a fundamental element in fostering attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It means that the woman should not fully comprehend your feelings towards her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Scientifically, women are drawn to men whose emotions possess a degree of mystery, leading to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | uncertainty]] prompts thinking, and prolonged thinking can lead to affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

When a woman interacts with you, her subconscious aims to find certainty, specifically seeking answers to three key questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>:
*   Do you genuinely desire her? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   How deeply are you interested in her? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Who holds more affection for the other? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

If you avoid providing clear answers to these questions, she will remain intrigued and continue to pursue them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Strategies to Maintain Uncertainty

To prevent her from gaining certainty about your feelings, consider the following actions:

#### 1. Avoid Compliments
Refrain from complimenting her, especially during the initial stages of getting to know her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. An attractive woman often has a high ego, and showering her with compliments will confirm her assumption that you are interested, ending her intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Instead, interact normally without flowery praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

#### 2. Don't Ask for Dates
After a good interaction, avoid immediately suggesting another date or expressing how much you enjoyed the current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This provides her with certainty, leading her to stop wondering about your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. If you leave without mentioning a next time, she will ponder whether you enjoyed it or want to see her again, fostering crucial thought processes that spark interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. Similarly, avoid asking for a date via message in the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

#### 3. Do Not Be Needy
Avoid asking her for anything that suggests you need her or her affection, such as her social media, a hug, a kiss, or for her to call you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This includes messages like "why don't you reply to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. By not seeking her approval or affection, you differentiate yourself from other men who constantly do, making her question your intentions and keeping you on her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This curiosity drives her desire to learn more about you, building strong [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> While maintaining uncertainty, avoid being completely cold or indifferent, as this provides her with a clear "no" and the certainty she seeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

#### 4. Don't Always Be Available
Do not constantly be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This means not immediately replying to messages and not being present every time she reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. If you went out today, wait about a week before suggesting another outing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

For a woman to develop feelings, she requires time, much of which should be spent *apart* from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | Attraction]] often builds when you are not physically present, allowing her to think about you throughout her day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> A girl will forget you if you are afraid she will forget you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. In a world where many men are constantly available and clingy, not being afraid of losing her makes you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

#### 5. Trust the Process
It is crucial to resist the internal urge to give her certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. You may feel compelled to compliment her, suggest meeting again, or express worry about her forgetting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Cultivate self-control and stick to these principles, as this approach also strengthens your self-discipline in all aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## The Second Key: Managing Expectations

The second key is to consistently act contrary to her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Never allow a girl to fully predict your actions or understand you completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

When you introduce uncertainty, she will start trying to predict your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Whatever she expects, do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. If you typically call her daily, skip a day; if you usually laugh, try a meeting without laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. This keeps her guessing, leaving her puzzled and unable to figure you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Do not engage in transparent games like mirroring her response times to appear "valuable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Women are perceptive and will recognize these tactics as inauthentic, granting them control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Instead, vary your responses organically: sometimes reply instantly, sometimes take your time, and other times, don't reply at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This approach makes you seem less interested while making your actions [[the_role_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | unpredictable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

By employing these strategies, you utilize uncertainty and managing expectations to foster [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | attraction]] and keep her continuously engaged and curious about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

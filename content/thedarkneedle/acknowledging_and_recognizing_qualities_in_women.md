This article explores techniques to make a woman interested by conveying that you have options and are selective, focusing on her intrinsic qualities rather than superficial traits.

## The Problem: Being Perceived as Having Limited Options

A common reason a girl might ignore you is if she perceives you as having limited options [00:01:04]. This often happens when a man gives too much attention, making her feel like she's the only one he wants and that he's willing to do anything to please her [00:00:19]. This conveys a belief that he doesn't have much value and his only dream is for her to notice him [00:00:25].

### Why Lying About Options Fails
Attempting to fix this by lying about having many options is a significant mistake [00:01:35]. This approach has two negative outcomes:
1.  **She discovers the lie:** Lying is a major attraction killer because it makes her feel you are willing to do anything to get her approval [00:02:01].
2.  **She detects your validation-seeking:** Even hinting that you have many options means you are [[avoiding_the_trap_of_seeking_validation_from_women | seeking her approval]], which is one of the biggest mistakes in [[understanding_female_attraction | attracting women]] [00:02:08]. This makes the situation worse [00:02:23].

## The Solution: The Qualifying Technique

Women generally don't care if you have a lot of options; what truly matters to them is how you interact with them [00:02:37]. If you treat a woman in a way that suggests you have options, she will assume you do [00:02:40]. The best way to achieve this is through a method called the "Qualifying Technique" [00:02:44].

### What is Qualifying?
Qualifying means screening or filtering [00:02:55]. This is an action typically performed by someone who has many options and needs to sort through them [00:02:57]. By qualifying a girl, you are subconsciously communicating that you have abundant options, as only guys with options would do this [00:03:02].

This technique is powerful and often overlooked, and it is an effective way to solidify a girl's [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] for you [00:03:10]. It shifts the dynamic from casual flirting to her wanting to impress you [00:03:17]. The mantra to remember is: "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" [00:03:26].

Qualifying makes a woman feel like you are choosing her over other girls and that she is beginning to win you over [00:03:29]. Crucially, she feels chosen not because of her looks, but because of who she is as a person [00:03:36]. If you don't qualify her, she might perceive that you're just saying anything to get her attention or that you have limited options and will take any girl [00:03:49]. When you qualify her, she gets the impression that you are selective because you have options, and she has been chosen for a specific reason [00:03:58].

## Three Ways to Qualify a Girl

### 1. The Qualifying Question
Ask a question that encourages her to reveal positive qualities about herself, and then acknowledge those qualities [00:04:18].
*   **Example 1:** "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason, I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" [00:04:23]
    *   This prompts her to think about what she can say to make you like her more, leading her to "sell herself" to you [00:04:38]. When she shares, accepting her by saying "Wow, that's really cool. I like that about you" makes her feel special and distinct from a random girl [00:04:48]. This also opens up new conversational avenues [00:04:59].
*   **Example 2:** "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" [00:05:06]
    *   **Important:** Always accept what she tells you. Rejecting her after she's put herself out there will make her feel rejected [00:05:17]. When she sells herself and you accept it, she feels she has won you over with her personality, not just her appearance [00:05:23]. This is especially important for attractive women who are often tired of being valued only for their looks [00:05:30]. This sets you apart as a man with standards who selectively chooses based on unique qualities [00:05:37].

### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've observed in her, and end it with a question that encourages her to agree [00:05:55]. When she accepts your statement as true, she feels good and will begin to act more consistently with that quality around you [00:06:01].
*   **Example 1:** "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" [00:06:08]
    *   Once she says "yeah, I guess I'm pretty open," she will start to act more consistently with that trait and become more open around you [00:06:28]. The statement should be genuine and something she would feel good about affirming [00:06:35]. She will feel that you recognize something valuable about her that others don't, fostering a special connection [00:06:38].
*   **Example 2:** "You know what I like about you? You're so bold. Like you don't filter yourself at all, you just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing, it makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong. Would you say that's true?" [00:06:53]
    *   The key is to make it open-ended, positive, and vague enough that she can't definitively say no [00:07:10]. By accepting her into that frame, she feels she needs to embody that characteristic to be accepted, leading her to become that person around you and feel special [00:07:17]. This can lead to her opening up emotionally and feeling a deep connection [00:07:29].
*   **Suggested Qualities to Look For:** Open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, easy to talk to [00:07:38].
*   **For attractive women:** A powerful qualifying statement is "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are" [00:07:48]. This is a truism for many attractive women who wish their intelligence was recognized more than their beauty [00:07:53]. People often value what they don't usually hear [00:08:02].

### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself
Often, girls will qualify themselves to you without prompting [00:08:35]. Your role is to simply notice and acknowledge her for it [00:08:39].
*   **Examples of a girl qualifying herself:**
    *   Bragging or telling you things about herself to gain your acceptance [00:08:44].
    *   [[expressing_genuine_interest_in_women | Chasing you]] with positive body language, like facing you or getting physically close [00:08:48].
    *   Touching you and showing direct interest, indicating she likes you and wants your reciprocation [00:08:52].
    *   Asking if you are single [00:08:57].
    *   Showing off for you [00:08:59].
*   **Response:** When you feel a girl is trying to impress you or gain your liking, acknowledge her by telling her what she's doing is cool, expressing that you like her, putting your arm around her, or doing something to accept her and let her know she's winning you over [00:09:01].
    *   Failing to acknowledge these actions can make her feel rejected, causing her to withdraw and become cold [00:09:18]. Conversely, acknowledging and accepting her will make her feel great and continue to favor you [00:09:26].

This practice of acknowledging appreciated qualities isn't limited to romantic interactions; it can be used with friends and other people to make them feel seen and valued [00:09:37].

## Important Note

Applying only the qualifying technique, without [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | understanding women's psychology]] fully, might lead to being put in the friend zone [00:05:47].

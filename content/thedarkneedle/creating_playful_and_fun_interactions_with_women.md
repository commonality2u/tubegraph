Many men struggle with [[avoiding_being_boring_and_predictable_with_women | running out of things to say]] when talking to women, often leading to awkward silences or even the [[setting_clear_intentions_in_interactions_with_women | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The key to [[effective_communication_with_women | effective communication]] is to engage in dialogue that is both deep and playful, separating you from other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Avoid the "Human Questionnaire" Trap

After breaking the ice, many men turn into "human questionnaires," bombarding women with mundane "get to know you" inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This relentless interrogation not only bores her but prevents genuine engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Instead of leaping from one question to the next, follow up her answer with a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This shows you're [[expressing_genuine_interest_in_women | listening]] and can connect on a deeper level, transforming the conversation from a monotonous Q&A into an engaging dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

> **Example:**
> You: "Do you have any pets?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
> Her: "Yeah, I actually have three of the cutest cats in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
> You: "Ah, so you're one of those cat people, huh? No, I'm not one of those crazy cat ladies, I just love my cats." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
> You: "They say people who like cats tend to be more independent than dog lovers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>
> This expands the topic, injecting fun and banter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Qualify Her to Shift the Dynamic

Once a man senses rapport, he might cling to safe topics, fearing he'll shatter the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This often results in [[avoiding_being_boring_and_predictable_with_women | boring a woman]] who was previously interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Instead, once you've sparked her interest, begin to "qualify" her with questions or statements that place you in the role of the selector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This involves making a statement that *might* disqualify her as a potential partner, creating a playful dynamic where she feels compelled to prove herself to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

> **Example:**
> You: "Hm, we would never get along. I'm a dog person, and I've heard that dog and cat owners tend to have a really intense sexual connection but disagree on every other possible point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
> Her: "Oh, really? Well, maybe we could find some common ground." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>
> This subtly challenges her, shifting the conversation from small talk to a playful battle of wits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Delve into Emotional and Mystical Realms

Men often stick to facts, events, and surface-level stories, which are good for small talk but don't ignite passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Women, however, get their fix from discussing mystical or deeper emotional meanings behind facts and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Use a "cold reading" to go beneath the surface and [[encouraging_women_to_invest_emotionally_in_conversations | get her to open up about her feelings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A cold read is stating something you've noticed about her and then making a deeper observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

> **Example:**
> You: "I can tell just by the way you're talking that you're the kind of girl who goes on a lot of dates but has trouble finding someone you're actually interested in. Then when you find that person, you usually lose interest very quickly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
> Her: "Yeah, that's so true." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
> You: "I bet you really love adventure. Sometimes it scares you, but deep down you crave something exciting. What's probably happening is that every time you meet these guys, you sense that they're not going to satisfy that adventure you crave." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
> This allows you to delve into emotional realms, presenting yourself as new and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Showcase Your Passions and Enthusiasm

Most men stick to interview-mode topics like work and school, failing to demonstrate their passionate side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This bores both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Women often look for "passion" in a man, and enthusiasm breeds enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

When talking to a woman, emphasize the things you're passionate and enthusiastic about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This can elevate a mundane subject into an engrossing conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. [[displaying_hobbies_in_a_way_thats_engaging_to_women | Let her feel your excitement]] for travel, see the leader in you if you're building a business, or share your love for music, art, or movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Focus on what drives you, not just your knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Keep the Conversation Playful and Fun with Teasing

When approaching a beautiful woman, men often put her on a pedestal, becoming afraid of offending her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. This makes the conversation fizzle out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Women want a guy who is fun to be around; they want to relax, laugh, and forget about worries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

The whole point of teasing is to create a fun environment where a woman can loosen up and open up to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This means being silly, treating her like a playful younger sister, and picking on her in a fun, flirtatious way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Don't be afraid to be a little goofy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

> **Examples of Teasing:**
> *   Getting ready to give her a high five, then pulling your hand away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
> *   Imitating her in a playful manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
> *   Suggesting she's coming on to you ("Wo, slow down there, at least buy me dinner first") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
> *   Telling an overly exaggerated lie, then picking on her for being gullible ("Wait, you actually thought I have a pet dragon?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

## Provide Multiple Conversation Threads

A common problem is running out of things to say, which happens because men either don't recognize how to smoothly change topics or don't provide enough new "threads" for the woman to grab onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Men often focus on what to say next instead of listening, missing opportunities for transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Always try to present her with several different topics she can latch onto when crafting your sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

> **Example:**
> Instead of: "I love baseball." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
> Say: "I love baseball because when I was young, my father used to take me to games and now that I'm older, I feel a real sense of nostalgia toward it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
> Now she can talk about baseball, her dad, or things that make her feel nostalgic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Listen for similar openings she gives you. If she says, "I love to cook. My mom taught me how to cook and now I even find myself watching those cooking shows on TV," you can improvise off one word, like "TV," to transition to a new topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

> **Example:**
> Her: "I love to cook. My mom taught me how to cook and now I even find myself watching those cooking shows on TV." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
> You: "Yeah, I'm the same way with those travel shows on TV. I start watching them and get sucked into all the amazing locations. So where would you go on vacation if money wasn't a factor?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
> This is like playing a conversational game of jazz, where improvisation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Anchor Positive Feelings to Yourself

Beautiful women crave fun and flirtatious conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. A main reason men don't communicate well is nervousness preventing them from showing their fun side, or speaking in a way she doesn't respond to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Women love to discuss the meaning behind actions and the emotions they evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Emotions arising during a conversation will subconsciously anchor them to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. If she talks about negative feelings (e.g., about a previous boyfriend), she will associate those feelings with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

To avoid this, draw her into a positive emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This can be done by teasing or by asking questions and making statements that prompt her to talk about specific positive feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

> **Example:**
> Her: "Yeah, I went snowboarding, I had the best time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>
> You: "Wow, I love snowboarding. I think I'm literally addicted to the rush I get going down the mountain. What about you? What excites you most about snowboarding?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>
> Her: "Well, I guess it would be that feeling of adventure, going so fast, being a little scared but not wanting it to end because it feels like you're living." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>
> By focusing on the meaning and positive emotions, you've subconsciously anchored feelings of adventure, excitement, and "truly living" to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

By applying these principles, you can enhance your [[the_formula_for_effective_conversation_with_women | conversational skills]] and create more engaging, fun, and memorable interactions with women, ultimately [[changing_behavior_to_avoid_being_ignored_by_women | improving your social life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

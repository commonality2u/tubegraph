This article explores the strategic use of criticism and compliments in building and maintaining relationships, focusing on how these interactions can influence a woman's perception and attraction.

## The Power of Thoughtful Criticism
Many men are hesitant to criticize women, fearing they might hurt their feelings or appear rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. However, this is a misconception; showing the confidence to express your opinion can actually be admired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:01">[03:23:01]</a>.

Thoughtful criticism, when applied appropriately, can significantly impact a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:01">[03:36:01]</a>. For example:
*   If an outfit doesn't suit her, you can say, "That outfit doesn't suit you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:01">[03:40:01]</a>.
*   If a photo isn't good, you can state, "That picture didn't turn out well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:01">[03:44:01]</a>.
*   If someone is smoking near you and you dislike it, you can confidently ask them to blow the smoke away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:01">[03:16:01]</a>.

### Making Compliments More Valuable
The key benefit of occasional criticism is that it elevates the value of your compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:01">[03:51:01]</a>. If you constantly compliment someone, your praise will lose its importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:01">[04:00:01]</a>. Humans naturally give more value to things that are rare or less frequent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:01">[04:24:01]</a>. Therefore, strategic criticism serves as a foundation that makes your subsequent compliments much more meaningful and desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:01">[04:38:01]</a>.

## Indirect Criticism and Overthinking
Girls tend to [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | overthink]] extensively, often creating scenarios and reflecting on small details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:01">[02:07:01]</a>. This tendency can be subtly leveraged.

### Hinting at Desired Traits
Instead of direct criticism, you can subtly mention something a girl is not good at or a trait you admire in others. For instance, if a girl says she doesn't know how to cook, you could later, in a natural flow of conversation, mention, "I really admire girls who know how to cook" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:01">[05:00:01]</a>. It's crucial not to state this directly or make her feel targeted, but to allow it to be a casual comment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:01">[05:06:01]</a>.

When she goes home, she will likely [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | overthink]] this comment, causing her to think about you and potentially desire to meet that unspoken expectation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:01">[05:22:01]</a>. The more a girl thinks about you, the more attached she becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:01">[05:28:01]</a>.

## Encouraging Her to Seek Your Approval
A powerful tactic is to put her in a position where she feels the need to earn your [[Impact of seeking approval and validation from women | approval and validation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:01">[09:00:01]</a>. Women inherently desire to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:01">[08:33:01]</a>.

### The "Philosophy Test"
1.  **State your preference:** Casually mention something you like, e.g., "I like philosophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:01">[08:21:01]</a>.
2.  **Ask her opinion later:** After some time, ask her, "Do you like philosophy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:01">[08:23:01]</a>.

There are two potential outcomes:
*   **She says yes:** This indicates she is trying to impress you and gain your [[Impact of seeking approval and validation from women | approval]], which increases her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:01">[08:30:01]</a>.
*   **She says no:** She will likely [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | overthink]] her answer later, wondering if she lost your interest or what your opinion of her is now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:01">[08:40:01]</a>. This reflection will make her want you more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:01">[08:58:01]</a>.

In both scenarios, you benefit because she is actively thinking about you and her standing with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:01">[09:00:01]</a>. If she says no and shows no interest in impressing you, simply change the subject and do not try to convince her or follow her lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:01">[09:06:01]</a>.

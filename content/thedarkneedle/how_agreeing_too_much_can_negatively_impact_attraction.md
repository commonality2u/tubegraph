When interacting with women, certain behaviors should be avoided, as they can sabotage your chances of developing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One significant mistake is consistently agreeing with a woman to keep her comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. This approach is ineffective and can be a major [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction killer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Constant Agreement

Agreeing with a woman on everything gives off a "weak vibe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. It can make her feel that you are seeking her approval or permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. By always playing by her rules and agreeing with everything she says, you are indirectly [[subcommunication_in_attracting_women | subcommunicating]] that you don't know how to gain the recognition you deserve from her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. This behavior suggests that you fear disagreement might work against you, and it displays a lack of [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | self-confidence]], making you appear afraid of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

For instance, an average guy initiating a conversation with an attractive woman might become overly concerned with choosing the "right words" to avoid upsetting her, leading him to ask boring questions and agree with everything she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This often results in the woman becoming bored and disengaging from the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Women generally desire a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>, and constantly agreeing with them eliminates any sense of challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.

### Seeking Approval vs. Creating Attraction

Desperately seeking a woman's approval and acceptance can fuel your own insecurity and push her away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. The moment a woman realizes you are seeking her approval, she will be turned off instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | Attraction]] is not something she can consciously control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. Seeking approval is a strong [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction killer]], preventing her from showing genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.

To avoid seeking approval, it's advised not to talk too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. When a man dominates a conversation, he might inadvertently focus on convincing her he's the best choice, which happens automatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Instead, allow her to do most of the talking and make the conversation about her, taking yourself out of the equation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. This helps you avoid the problem of seeking her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## Not Being "Easy"

Another common mistake is being too quick to agree and fall into the "yes circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Many guys constantly say "yes" even when they might want to say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. It's important to make her work a little to get a "yes" response from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

For example, if she asks to go shopping, you could respond by suggesting to watch a movie first and then go shopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>. The key is to never be direct with a "yes"; either set some conditions before agreeing or make her request you more before you give in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

It's crucial to apply this principle discerningly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>. This strategy should only be used for casual or random requests, not for important or urgent situations, such as if she is sick and needs to go to a doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. The goal is to show a measured approach rather than constant complaisance, which aligns with the broader [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | dynamics of attraction]] and [[importance_of_decisiveness_and_logic_in_building_attraction | decisiveness]].

If you consistently find yourself ignored by women, it signifies a problem rooted in your behavior, not your financial status or physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Relying solely on self-improvement in areas like finances or fitness won't resolve this issue, as people "worse" off than you may still attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Even wealth won't change the dynamic; women who approach you while you're being ignored are likely seeking financial exploitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The solution to being ignored lies in changing your behavior and the way you interact with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## The Problem: Neediness

The primary reason women ignore you stems from your behavior, specifically the effort you exert to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. When you make an effort to be liked, such as pretending to share interests or buying gifts, you step out of your natural self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This effort signals "need" – a fundamental human drive to obtain something we lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The number one killer of [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] is **neediness** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
Neediness isn't expressed verbally; it's a feeling a woman perceives when you make an obvious effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This perceived neediness is why she begins to ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

When a woman observes that you have deviated from your authentic self, she will instinctively start ignoring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This explains why a woman you have no romantic interest in might develop feelings for you – you are simply being yourself around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. To overcome being ignored, you must avoid being needy by ceasing to make excessive effort, and instead, remain in your natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## The Solution: Be Natural and Detached

The key is to convey that you don't "need" her and to maintain your natural self around her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Avoid manipulative tactics often found online, such as delaying replies or intentionally being late, as these are often noticed and are not a genuine solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Here are key behavioral rules to apply:

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion

Focus entirely on enjoying your time without concern for the outcome or whether she approves of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Be detached from the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Playful Interaction:** Engage in lighthearted, unexpected actions. For example, playfully tapping a water bottle on her head and saying "Sh" when she's bantering or joking demonstrates that you are being yourself and enjoying the moment without caring about her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This shows you're relaxed and natural, similar to how you would interact with a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **Affirmative Playfulness:** If she does you a small favor, lightly pat her head and say "Good girl," treating her playfully like a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This indicates you're acting on impulse, without considering her judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This is an example of [[effectiveness_of_playful_interaction_with_women | Effectiveness of playful interaction with women]].
*   **Humor in Adversity:** If she shares a minor setback (e.g., a low exam score or falling), instead of offering sympathy, laugh and joke with her, assuming she's in a mood for playful banter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This shows you're enjoying your time without "needing" her to feel better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.
*   **Maintain Your Comfort:** If you smoke and she complains about the smoke, simply state you'll finish your current cigarette and let her move away if it bothers her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. You shouldn't be the one to adjust your behavior to cater to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself

Avoid making special efforts that deviate from your normal life just because she's present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

*   **Date Choices:** Take her to places you would genuinely enjoy with a friend, even if it's a park or a free location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Choosing places where staff know you makes her feel she's an addition to your existing life, not the sole focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Attire:** Dress normally and simply, prioritizing your comfort rather than wearing extravagant clothes or spending excessive time on your appearance for a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This signals that you're relaxed and not trying hard to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Accept Flaws:** If she criticizes a perceived flaw or weakness (e.g., not knowing how to drive), laugh it off and admit it casually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Don't try to prove her wrong or hide your imperfections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Resist "Tests":** When a woman states her preference for certain qualities (e.g., "I like guys who go to the gym"), do not try to meet her standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Instead, turn it into a joke, such as saying, "You've got great taste" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### 3. Never Compete Over Her

Avoid situations where you feel compelled to compete for a woman's attention or approval with other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Avoid Seeking Approval:** Do not attempt to outperform other men by telling better jokes, looking stronger, or sharing more exciting stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Competing for a woman's approval indicates neediness, insecurity, and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Maintain Composure:** Stay calm and natural in group settings, as if no women are present, and simply enjoy the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Elevate Others:** Actively appreciate and acknowledge the value of other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Laugh at their jokes, listen to their stories without trying to one-up them, and applaud their achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This shows confidence and lack of need, making you stand out positively to women who notice such behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jealousy:** If you see a woman you like with another man, do not inquire about him or show jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. To further demonstrate confidence, consider introducing her to a friend who is more handsome than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This action explicitly communicates self-confidence and a lack of possessiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### 4. Comfortable Body Language

Your body language should naturally reflect comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Do not try to adopt specific postures or movements that you've heard online; instead, simply be comfortable in your own skin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Whether your hands are in your pockets, on your head, or you're stretched out, as long as you're comfortable, your body language will convey the right message, and a woman's mind will subconsciously pick up on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

By adopting these behaviors – enjoying your time without needing her approval, avoiding overextension, refraining from competition, and maintaining comfortable body language – you communicate that you are a man who doesn't need a woman's validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>. This approach ensures you are never ignored, because you won't be putting in effort or chasing her in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. This is a fundamental aspect of [[psychology_of_attracting_women | psychology of attracting women]] and avoiding the [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | impact of seeking approval and validation from women]].

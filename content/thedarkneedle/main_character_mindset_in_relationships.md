The "main character mindset" is a crucial perspective to adopt for attracting women and building strong social connections. It involves seeing yourself as the central figure of your own life, rather than making others, particularly women, the focus of your efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Making Her the Main Character

A common mistake many men make is treating the girl as the main character of their interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This often stems from societal conditioning, where media and social narratives portray women as the ultimate reward or goal for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This perspective elevates women to a high pedestal, causing men to seek their approval or attention rather than acting from a place of self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

An illustrative example is when the speaker, wanting to impress a girl studying rehabilitation sciences, researched her field and learned its terminology to discuss it with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Despite his efforts, he was completely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This outcome was a direct result of making her interests the priority, rather than maintaining his own narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Instead, the recommended mindset is: "I am the main character. She's just a side quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This allows you to view her role as adding enjoyment to your life, rather than being the ultimate purpose of your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Applying the Main Character Mindset

To successfully implement this [[fundamental_mindset_for_attracting_women | mindset]], focus on understanding women and their thought processes, rather than just memorizing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Once you understand them, you can naturally develop your own effective strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### 1. Choose the Topic of Conversation

The person who holds more value in a conversation is the one who chooses the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. A common mistake is trying to discover a girl's interests and then talking about them to impress her, which often leads to the [[dangers_of_overcommitting_emotionally_early_in_a_relationship | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Instead, talk about something *you* genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. This isn't about talking *about yourself* but rather about topics that genuinely interest you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. If she mentions a topic you don't like, such as history, don't force a conversation about it. Instead, you can challenge her or ask about her emotional connection to the topic, such as "You don't seem like the type who reads books" or "What do you like about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Focus on discussing emotions rather than just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For example, if a girl at the gym talks about her training, connecting over *why* she enjoys working out and the emotions behind it will create a stronger connection than discussing nutrition or exercise science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The core principle is to never talk about something you don't care about just to impress or gain her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### 2. Don't Prove Anything

When interacting with others, especially women, constantly remind yourself that you don't need to prove anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This conveys that she is not the most important thing in your life and not the main character in your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

*   **Handling challenges:** If she calls you a liar or stupid, don't try to convince her otherwise. A simple "Yes, I'm a liar" or "Yeah, I'm stupid," followed by a laugh, reinforces that her opinion does not dictate your self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   **Managing interruptions:** If she interrupts you while you're speaking, don't attempt to finish your sentence or tell her to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Let her talk and don't return to your previous topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This signals that her interruption doesn't bother you and her opinion isn't paramount, which can make her more attached to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Similarly, if a conversation is disrupted, don't try to pick it up exactly where it left off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

This approach applies to all social interactions, not just with women. It reinforces the [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | confidence]] that you will be fine regardless of whether others listen to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 3. Practice Complete Honesty

Honesty is a powerful tool for building attachment in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Lying often stems from seeing the other person as holding higher value, whether out of fear of their opinion or a perceived need for their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Therefore, never lie to a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Most attractive women expect men to lie, as it's part of their life experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When you demonstrate honesty, it creates a unique impression, prompting her to wonder about your [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | confidence]] and why you aren't seeking her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

To truly convey honesty, especially to women who can detect lies effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, you must be honest even in situations that make you look bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Humans tend to believe someone who admits to an unflattering truth more readily than someone who tells a story that makes them look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows that you are honest even under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

For example, a student of the speaker, when asked why he works out, honestly replied, "to get girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This uncomfortable truth made the girl present feel that he was genuinely honest and didn't care about her opinion of him, leading to a deeper conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

If a girl asks if you've been in a fight, you can say, "Yes, one day I got into a fight and the guy beat me up" and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Or, if you genuinely dislike her outfit, tell her it doesn't look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This [[mindset_and_selfesteem_in_relationships | confidence]] in telling the "uncomfortable truth" demonstrates that you are the main character and don't rely on her validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

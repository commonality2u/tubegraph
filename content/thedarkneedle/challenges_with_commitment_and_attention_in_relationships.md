Navigating romantic relationships can be confusing, largely because most people are not taught how dating works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Society often fails to provide an instruction manual for dealing with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Dating as a Marketplace

Dating can be viewed as a marketplace governed by laws that are general principles and patterns, rather than strict rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These laws stem from millions of years of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a> and are rooted in the primal biological instinct to reproduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Evolutionary Strategies and Conflict

Men and women have evolved different strategies to fulfill the reproductive instinct, often leading to conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>:
*   **Men's Strategy** In early human days, the most effective strategy for men was to impregnate as many women as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Women's Strategy** For women, the best approach was to reject many men and secure the long-term commitment of one man to provide security for a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Although we live in a modern age, these ancient, primal drives continue to shape human behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### The Fundamental Conflict

This evolutionary divergence creates a core conflict in modern relationships:
*   Women are the gatekeepers of sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   Men are the gatekeepers of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Essentially, women use sex to attract men and secure their commitment, while men use the promise of commitment to attract women and gain a sexual relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. In the relationship market, sex and commitment function as currency, exchanged by men and women to achieve their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Understanding Commitment as Currency

For men, commitment is their primary currency in the relationship market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. It is essential to value this currency to prevent issues like a woman's ego growing and overshadowing a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

There are four recognized levels of commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>:
1.  **Attention and Approval** What a woman seeks when she first becomes aware of a man's presence in the relationship market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
2.  **Non-Exclusive Dating** When both individuals decide they like each other and begin spending time together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Explicit Exclusive Relationship** When both parties clearly agree to be in a committed, exclusive relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
4.  **Marriage** The ultimate commitment, often a dream for most women from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### The Ego Problem and Undervaluing Attention

The "ego problem" often arises at the initial stage, before mutual interest is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. If a man gives his [[the_importance_of_attention_and_how_to_manage_it_effectively | attention]] and approval too easily, a woman will not value him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Many men repeatedly fail by giving women excessive attention simply because they find them attractive, leading to complete undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Examples of giving too much attention include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>:
*   Complimenting her looks immediately.
*   Agreeing with everything she says.
*   Overloading her with praise.
*   Giving her significantly more attention than other women.

[[the_importance_of_attention_and_how_to_manage_it_effectively | Attention]] and approval are valuable resources that women desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Men should be more selective about how easily they are given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Just as a man is not entitled to a woman's body, a woman is not entitled to a man's attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These should only be offered to women who invest their time and energy in engaging with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

## Elevating Your Value

To manage a woman's ego and maintain your standing, you must elevate yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> by placing a high value on yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Success with women is often described as a state of mind, where she feels what you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 1. Winning the Game of Chicken

The "game of chicken" is a challenge where two individuals confront each other to see who will back down first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. In relationships, backing down means surrendering your power to the other person, often to be liked, gain approval, ease tension, or avoid conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

You "blink" or surrender when you:
*   Panic and backpedal after noticing her negative reaction to something you've said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Change your demeanor to prove you're not a "player" after she expresses disdain for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.
*   Lose your confidence when she yawns or frowns, thinking you've annoyed her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Hesitate to kiss her because you're unsure if she wants it, placing greater value on her desires than your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

By surrendering, you give her the power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. People instantly notice and respect you when they realize they cannot intimidate you or manipulate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. When a beautiful woman senses you are not intimidated by her, she assumes you are better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Your status is defined by your attitude towards yourself and women, and by your confidence and courage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### 2. Communicating from a Position of Implicit Status

The best way to communicate confidence and power without seeming arrogant is to be non-reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

*   **When criticized:** If a woman makes a negative comment, such as criticizing your attire, a reactive response involves defending yourself or trying to impress her with a clever comeback <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. A non-reactive response involves staying calm, accepting the comment without defensiveness, and continuing the conversation as if nothing significant was said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
*   **When complimented:** If a woman compliments you, a reactive response might involve nervousness, over-explaining, or feeling an immediate need to return the compliment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. A non-reactive response is simply saying "thanks, that's kind of you" and carrying on the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

This non-reactive style conveys high status, as a woman notices when you are unaffected by what she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Starting to justify your opinions, preferences, or interests signals that her opinion of you matters more than your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.

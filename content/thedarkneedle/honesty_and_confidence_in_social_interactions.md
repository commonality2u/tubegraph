When engaging in social interactions, particularly with women, developing a mindset where you are the "main character" and exhibiting genuine [[Honesty and Confidence in Social Interactions#Complete Honesty | honesty]] can significantly alter outcomes, fostering connection rather than disinterest or the friend zone. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>

## The "Main Character" Mindset

A common mistake in social interactions, especially when trying to connect with a girl, is making her the main character in your story, rather than yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Society often trains individuals to view women as the "ultimate goal" or a "reward" for hard work and success, which can lead to placing them on a high pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This mindset can make you stop seeing a person as merely a "side quest" in your life's journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

Instead, adopt the [[mindset_and_confidence_in_social_interactions | mindset]] that "I am the main character; she's just a side quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. See yourself as the protagonist and others as side characters whose role is to add enjoyment to your experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This perspective is not about memorizing lines or techniques, but about truly understanding human nature and how others think, which will allow you to naturally [[building_social_skills_and_connections | invent your own techniques]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Choosing the Conversation Topic

One critical aspect of this mindset is who chooses the topic of conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>
> "When two people are talking, the one with more value is the one who chooses the topic."

Many people try to find out a girl's interests and talk about those things to impress her, which often leads to the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Instead, talk about something you genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. If you don't like a topic she brings up, don't force yourself to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. You can acknowledge her interest and ask about her reasons, but maintain your own conversational lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

It is crucial to distinguish between talking about a person and talking about a topic. If the conversation is about the person, talk about her. If it's about a general topic, choose one you enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

### Speaking About Emotions, Not Just Facts

When interacting, focus on speaking about emotions rather than just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For example, instead of discussing nutrition and exercise science with someone who trains at a gym, ask them *why* they work out and *why* they enjoy it, focusing on the emotions behind their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This approach fosters a deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

However, if you genuinely love a factual topic, feel free to discuss it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The key is never to talk about something you don't care about simply to impress someone or gain their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Always remember that you are the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Not Needing to Prove Anything

To convey that she is not the most important thing in your life and not the main character in your story, consistently remind yourself that you don't need to prove anything to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

*   **Accepting perceived flaws:** If she challenges your story by calling you a liar, agree with her and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If she calls you stupid, agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This demonstrates [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | self-confidence]] and that her opinion does not diminish your self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Think of her as an NPC (Non-Player Character) in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Handling interruptions:** If she interrupts you while you're speaking enthusiastically, don't try to finish your point or tell her to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Just let her talk and don't return to the interrupted topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This signals that her opinion or interruption doesn't disrupt your flow or confidence, thereby making her feel more attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The same applies if the conversation is generally disrupted; don't force a return to the previous topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Always tell yourself, "Whether people listen to me or not, I'll still be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If a group interrupts you, it means they aren't interested in what you were saying, and there's no need to repeat it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Reiterate to yourself: you are the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

## Complete Honesty

[[being_natural_and_authentic_around_women | Complete honesty]] is a powerful tool for building attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

*   **Lying indicates lower perceived value:** When someone lies, it often indicates that they perceive the other person as having higher value, fearing their opinion or needing their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Therefore, never lie to a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   **Girls detect lies:** Attractive women often assume men will lie due to their past experiences, and they are generally adept at detecting falsehoods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When they encounter someone who is genuinely honest, it makes them question why you aren't lying and where your [[confidence_and_decisionmaking_in_relationships | confidence]] comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **The power of "unflattering truth":** To demonstrate genuine honesty and [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | confidence]], be honest even in situations that might make you look bad or put you under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if asked about a fight, admitting you lost makes your honesty more believable than claiming victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is because humans judge someone's true nature by how they behave under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

    *   **Example from a student:** A student, when asked why he works out, honestly replied, "to get girls," despite a girl he liked being present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This unflattering but honest truth made the girl feel he was genuinely honest and didn't care about her opinion of him, leading her to initiate further conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

To appear honest, learn to say the uncomfortable truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This shows that you are the main character and are extremely [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | confident]] in yourself, not caring what she thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

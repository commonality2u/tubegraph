When studying the psychology of women and attraction, a common phrase encountered is "if a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This statement is true, but the type of respect needed for attraction differs from ordinary respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Types of Respect

There are two distinct types of respect in the context of attraction:

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>: This is the respect one might feel for a kind elderly man, or for friends, including those in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. It's the result of common advice like [[setting_boundaries_in_relationships | setting boundaries]] or respecting the other person, but it does not lead to romantic attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
2.  **Emperor-like Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>: This is the respect felt for a powerful, inspiring, and impressive figure, like a Roman Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Men who receive this type of respect are the ones women fantasize about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This is the kind of respect a woman should have for you to foster attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

Emperor-like respect is not built overnight; it gradually accumulates over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. This "attractive respect" is when she *wants* to respect you, rather than you trying to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It is composed of two key elements: **power** and **fear** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

## Building Power in Relationships

[[Power dynamics and respect in romantic relationships | Power]] is the first crucial component for building attraction and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Maintain Your Life and Identity

Being powerful means your life remains consistent after meeting a woman as it was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Any changes should be for *your* reasons, not hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Women often test a man by trying to make him change, especially in the early stages of a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. This could involve comments on your style, haircut, habits, or even your friends or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Succumbing to these tests leads to a loss of power and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

Your opinions should also remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Avoid agreeing with her simply out of fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. While you shouldn't argue, simply say "no" calmly to her suggestions for change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. It's important to speak through your actions rather than constantly justifying or debating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Don't Sacrifice for Her

Sacrificing your happiness or enjoyment for a woman, as often depicted in media, can lead to being "friend-zoned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. For example, if you quit a hobby you enjoy like video games solely because she told you to, you lose your power as a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. A woman should never be the reason for your change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Stop Apologizing Unnecessarily

Avoid apologizing without reason or for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If you haven't done anything wrong, do not apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Before apologizing, ask yourself if you genuinely made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

Consider the following scenarios for apologies:

*   **You did nothing wrong but she's upset:** Do not apologize. Instead, tease her and joke around a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **You made a small mistake (e.g., forgetting a birthday gift):** Your apology should be brief. Simply say "sorry" and then give her space. Do not beg for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
*   **You made a big mistake (e.g., cheating):** In this case, it's appropriate to go out of your way to apologize, such as buying a gift or visiting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Responding to Her Mistakes

When she is at fault, your response is key to maintaining [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | power dynamics and respect in romantic relationships]]:

*   **Small mistake / She is upset:** Do not show anger or drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Don't show that her words upset you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Moderate mistake (e.g., canceling last minute):** Hold her accountable without getting angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. For instance, say "you're messing up your chances with me" and hang up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. If she calls back, you might playfully demand an apology letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. If she refuses, end the conversation and do not contact her again unless she contacts you first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. She should face consequences for her mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Big mistake (e.g., cheating):** Do not get angry, but end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Forgiving such a mistake will cause her to lose respect for you permanently and never truly love you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Stay Calm and In Control

A crucial aspect of [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | leadership dynamics in relationships]] is never letting a woman make you angry or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. If her actions can control your reactions, she is the one in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Even if she says nasty things, do not react with anger or lose your composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Often, she may be testing you to see your reaction to extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Failing this test means losing your power and her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

## Cultivating "Enjoyable Fear"

The second element of attractive respect is a subtle, enjoyable kind of fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This is understood through the principle: **Investment = Attraction = Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### The Importance of Her Investment

A common mistake men make is believing their own investment (e.g., expensive dates, luxury cars) is what wins a woman over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. This often leads to the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

The key insight is that **her investment in you** is what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The more you chase her and invest in her, the more *you* become attached, while her feelings may remain unchanged because she isn't investing in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. For her attraction and desire to increase, her investment must increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Encouraging Her Investment

To reverse the situation, you need to encourage her to invest in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. You should still invest enough to make her comfortable investing in you, but then let her take the lead in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

As she invests more time, effort, and even money in you, her fear of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This is because humans tend to fear losing something they have significantly invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This fear is the second component of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

When [[techniques_to_shift_power_dynamics | power and this enjoyable fear]] combine, a woman will not dare to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

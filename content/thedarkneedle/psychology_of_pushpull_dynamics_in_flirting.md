Push-pull flirting is a technique that involves a playful blend of pushing a woman away and pulling her back in, both physically and verbally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This approach aims to create a "roller coaster ride of emotions" for the woman, making her more invested in the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## How Push-Pull Flirting Works

The core of push-pull flirting lies in creating contradiction and tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. By simultaneously showing interest and then playfully withdrawing it, the interaction becomes more intriguing and exciting, keeping the woman "on her toes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | excitement]] and intrigue are crucial for deeper engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.

### Examples of Push-Pull Dynamics

*   **Example 1**: Saying "You're too cute for me to handle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   This pulls her in emotionally by calling her "cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
    *   It simultaneously pushes her away by implying she's too much to handle, creating a contradiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
*   **Example 2**: Stating "You're awesome, you're like my little sister" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.
    *   The compliment ("You're awesome") pulls her in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
    *   The comparison to a "little sister" (a non-romantic association) pushes her away, generating playful tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

## Demonstrating High Value

Beyond creating excitement, push-pull flirting serves to demonstrate that the flirter is a high-value individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

Consider the following analogy: if a woman is perceived as incredible and then immediately "throws herself at your feet" with no challenge, her perceived value might diminish, and interest could be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Women experience a similar [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

This explains why women may lose interest in "nice guys" who constantly try to please them, but are drawn to "jerks" or "bad boys" who play hard to get <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. The principle is captured by Thomas Payne's quote: "What we obtain too cheap, we esteem too lightly; it is dearness only that gives everything its value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. By not making it too easy, push-pull flirting implies that you are a challenge worth pursuing, thus increasing your perceived value.

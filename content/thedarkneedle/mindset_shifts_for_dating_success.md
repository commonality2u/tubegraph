## Understanding the Dynamics of Attraction

A fundamental aspect of [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | dating]] success involves understanding an innate human desire for approval, particularly prevalent in women. Women often dedicate significant time and resources to their appearance, such as weight loss, skincare, and makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This behavior stems from a deeply rooted instinct to gain the approval of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

For a man, the key to attracting a woman is to make her strive for *his* approval, effectively "feeding" this inherent instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This approach makes the woman "yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a> and is considered one of the easiest ways to attract her due to this natural inclination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## Emotional Basis of Relationships

It's crucial to recognize that human emotional relationships typically involve one party seeking the other's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Women in relationships do not operate on logic; dating is fundamentally governed by emotion, not rationality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This [[the_importance_of_mindset_and_selfperception | mindset]] is vital to adopt for successful interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

## Key Mindset Shifts

### 1. Do Not Try to Impress Her

A primary rule in [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | attracting women]] is to avoid actively trying to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. A highly attractive trait in a man is his lack of concern for gaining a woman's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Modern societal programming often leads men to believe they must earn a woman's approval, fostering a subconscious drive to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

To counteract this, acknowledge the internal pressure to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. When you feel this urge, redirect it by thinking: "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Over time, this [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | mindset]] shift becomes automatic, creating space for her to seek *your* approval instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### 2. The Recipe for Encouraging Her Approval

The strategy to make a woman seek your approval involves two combined elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>:

*   **Do Not Give Her Immediate Validation:** Since women crave validation, avoid giving it easily. If you offer it immediately, the "game" ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This means not liking every social media post, not commenting on everything, and not appearing obsessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. When she doesn't receive immediate validation, her instincts kick in, prompting her to wonder why and how to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Express Your Preferences:** Simultaneously, articulate what you like in a girl's personality and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This provides her with a clear path to earn your approval. She will internally determine that to gain your approval, she must align with your stated preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

#### Conditions for Success:

1.  **Partial Alignment of Preferences:** A small portion (approximately 40%) of your stated preferences should already be present in her, while 60% should not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. This prevents you from appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For example, if all other men validate her for wearing a shirt, but you state a preference for dresses and don't validate her shirt, she'll shift her behavior to gain your unique validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
2.  **General Expression of Opinion:** When stating preferences (e.g., liking short hair or organized people), speak generally. Do not direct your words at her or imply that she *should* change for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Your words should reflect only your opinion, nothing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. This is part of [[effective_communication_in_dating | effective communication]] and Charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. She will automatically apply your preferences to herself and begin to adopt them to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
3.  **Selective Reaction:** Do not react to everything she says or does, especially if it's unremarkable. Many men mistakenly react to a woman simply because she is beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. If she says something dull or silly, don't laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While this might make her feel slightly embarrassed, this discomfort is necessary for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Only react when something is genuinely good or remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This conveys that your admiration must be earned through unique qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
4.  **Approach with Curiosity, Not Admiration:** When asking questions to get to know her, your [[developing_a_confident_mindset | mindset]] should be one of genuine curiosity, not admiration or an eagerness to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Your body language and tone should reflect that you haven't yet decided whether to admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Interrogation:** Never allow a woman to interrogate you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. If she repeatedly asks questions, you lose control of the conversation, and she becomes the judge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. As the man, you are the one who chooses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. Respond briefly, or use phrases like "It's a long story," then shift the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
5.  **Manage Your Own Need for Approval:** When she attempts to impress you by sharing her accomplishments (e.g., Taekwondo, good grades), your internal pressure to gain *her* approval might be triggered, especially if you share common interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   To prevent this from undermining her efforts to win your approval, either comment casually on what she said or, even better, make it seem like you are not proficient at the skill or trait she is highlighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. For example, if she says she practices Taekwondo, you could say, "I tried it once and almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This creates space for her to impress you and demonstrate her capabilities, thus pushing her into a state of seeking your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

Applying these [[strategies_for_maintaining_confidence_and_selfworth_in_dating | strategies for maintaining confidence and self-worth]] and [[navigating_the_dating_market | navigating the dating market]] will create a strong desire in the woman to win your approval, leading her to actively try to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

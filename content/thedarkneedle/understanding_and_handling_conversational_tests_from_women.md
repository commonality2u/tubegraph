This article explores the concept of conversational "tests" women subconsciously employ during interactions, and how understanding these tests is crucial for attracting women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Woman's Subconscious "Radar"

When interacting with a woman, her subconscious mind, described as a "radar" that controls attraction and seeks a suitable partner, evaluates you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04">[01:04]</a>. This radar operates separately from her conscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21">[02:21]</a>.

### Emotion-Driven Attraction
Women are primarily [[Understanding womens emotions | emotional beings]] and are drawn to what they feel, making decisions based on emotions rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14">[01:14]</a>. Their actions are emotion-based, meaning they cannot consciously control who they are attracted to or not attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43">[01:43]</a>. Attraction is a [[Understanding behavior and its impact on attention from women | subconscious response]] women have towards certain behaviors exhibited by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48">[01:48]</a>.

### The Radar's Purpose
The primary goal for a woman, from birth, is to find the "right man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47">[02:47]</a>. This right man is not chosen consciously, but rather is sought out and selected by her internal radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04">[03:04]</a>. This radar scans to determine if you are suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10">[03:10]</a>, specifically looking at whether you appear to be "better than her" or if she is better than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17">[03:17]</a>. It assesses this by observing how you interact and whether you treat her in a way that shows you see yourself as better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22">[03:22]</a>. If you treat her as if you are better, her radar will confirm this, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30">[03:30]</a>.

## The Purpose of Conversational Tests

The woman's internal radar will push her to perform certain [[handling_tests_from_women_during_flirting | tests]] to determine if you are "the real deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26">[10:26]</a>. These tests assess if you are genuinely the "right guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31">[10:31]</a>.

### Why Tests Occur
These tests are designed to verify if you truly embody the higher-value qualities that trigger subconscious attraction. They confirm whether you genuinely operate from a mindset of seeing yourself as being in a higher position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54">[00:54]</a> and not needing her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>.

### The Challenge of Tests
When these tests occur, men often panic and lose focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36">[10:36]</a>. A single test can make a man lose composure and forget everything he has learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41">[10:41]</a>. It can also make her doubt your genuineness, causing her to suspect you are only pretending to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45">[10:45]</a>.

## Setting the Stage for Success

To appear as the higher-value individual and mitigate the impact of tests, it's essential to cultivate specific mindsets and behaviors.

### Internal Mindset
Shift your internal mindset when talking to a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31">[00:31]</a>. Remember she is just a human being, nothing more, and avoid placing her on a pedestal simply because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36">[00:36]</a>. Instead, see yourself as being in a higher position while she is in a lower one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54">[00:54]</a>. This change in perspective is crucial to avoid the [[Challenges smart men face with women | challenges smart men face with women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44">[00:44]</a>.

### Body Language Cues
*   **Lean Away**: Avoid leaning towards her while talking, as this can signal excessive interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15">[04:15]</a>. Instead, make it a habit to lean away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22">[04:22]</a>.
*   **Be Ready to Walk Away**: If she says something you disapprove of, almost start walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28">[04:28]</a>. This demonstrates high value, as attractive women are unaccustomed to men walking away from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44">[04:44]</a>. For example, if she says "I'm not really interested," you could reply, "I know, I'm probably too much for you to handle. You're too much of a nice girl anyway," and then begin to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32">[04:32]</a>.
*   **Comfort is Key**: Sit comfortably and don't care about how she perceives your posture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37">[05:37]</a>. The person with higher value in a conversation sits comfortably and isn't concerned about the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27">[05:27]</a>. This mindset shows you are at ease and don't need to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52">[05:52]</a>.

### [[How to structure conversations with women | Conversation Structure]]

A general formula for [[Creating engaging conversations with women | conversation structure]] is:
*   **50% about her and her personality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34">[06:34]</a>. This involves asking about what she likes, dislikes, childhood, dreams, and self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32">[07:32]</a>.
*   **30% about the environment or anything else** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38">[06:38]</a>. During this phase, say whatever comes to mind without overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50">[07:50]</a>. It's acceptable to say silly things or talk about anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59">[07:59]</a>. Avoid getting angry or debating to prove a point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41">[08:41]</a>, as you don't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47">[08:47]</a>. This involves [[effectiveness_of_playful_interaction_with_women | messing around]] and not trying to convey a certain idea or be serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38">[08:38]</a>.
*   **20% about you** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43">[06:43]</a>. When talking about yourself, never try to appear amazing or boast about achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56">[08:56]</a>. Instead, make fun of yourself a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05">[09:05]</a> and tell stories that make you seem silly or crazy, not great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09">[09:09]</a>. This shows you don't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14">[09:14]</a>.

### Be Mysterious
Incorporate an element of mystery into your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19">[09:19]</a>. This doesn't mean faking your personality, but rather not revealing too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:29">[09:29]</a>. Giving too much detailed information quickly can unintentionally signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47">[09:47]</a>.

For example:
*   Her: "Where do you work?"
    *   You: "Hold on there, speedy kitten. We've just met and you're already interviewing me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53">[09:53]</a>
*   Her: "What are you doing Saturday night?"
    *   You: "Something exciting but secret, sorry, can't tell you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06">[10:06]</a>
*   Her: "Have you ever been in a relationship?"
    *   You: "I don't know you that well yet; I don't discuss private stuff with strangers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12">[10:12]</a>
*   Her: "So what's your name?"
    *   You: "Take a guess. I'll give you a candy if you get it right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17">[10:17]</a>

Keeping some information guarded ensures there's always more she'll want to discover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01">[10:01]</a>.

## Conclusion

While the formula and mindsets discussed help in setting the stage, dealing with the specific problem of [[handling_tests_from_women_during_flirting | tests]] will be covered in upcoming discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50">[10:50]</a>.

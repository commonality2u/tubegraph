Understanding and fostering the right kind of respect is crucial for successful relationships. The commonly heard phrase, "If a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you," is true, but the type of respect required in a romantic context differs significantly from ordinary respect [00:00:06].

## Two Types of Respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect**: This is the respect one might feel for a kind, elderly family member or a friend, including those in the friend zone [00:00:44]. It lacks romantic attraction [00:01:39].
2.  **Emperor-like Respect**: This is the respect felt for a powerful, inspiring, and impressive figure, like a Roman Emperor [00:01:00]. Men who elicit this type of respect are often fantasized about and desired [00:01:07]. This is the kind of respect a woman should have for you in a romantic relationship [00:01:12].

Unlike the misconception that respect can be built overnight, it gradually builds over time [00:01:18]. Superficial advice like "set boundaries" or "don't let her cross them" typically leads only to "grandfatherly" respect and the friend zone [00:01:29].

The kind of respect that creates attraction and desire is built through your actions and personality, making her *want* to respect you rather than you trying to earn it [00:02:05]. This attractive respect is made up of two key components: **power** and a subtle form of **fear** [00:02:17].

## Component 1: Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

Having power in your relationship means that your life remains fundamentally the same after meeting her as it was before [00:02:40].

### Maintaining Your Autonomy and Life Structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>

Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay the same. While you can try new things, it should be for your own reasons, not because of her [00:02:49]. For instance, if you quit smoking, it should be because *you* want to, not because she asked you to [00:02:52].

Women often test men, especially in the early stages, by trying to make them change. This can involve comments about your style, haircut, habits, friends, or even job [00:03:01]. If you comply with her demands, you will lose your power and, consequently, her respect [00:03:17].

Your opinions should also remain steadfast [00:03:23]. Do not change your stance or agree with her merely out of fear of losing her or a desire to appear agreeable [00:03:39]. When she suggests you change something, simply say "no" calmly, without aggression or justification [00:03:57]. In interactions with women, it's vital to speak through your actions rather than prolonged discussions or debates [00:03:59].

### Avoid Sacrifice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

Sacrificing your happiness or things you enjoy for a girl, as often depicted in movies, is counterproductive [00:04:10]. If you sacrifice for a girl, she will likely put you in the [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | friend zone]] [00:04:14]. For example, if you stop playing video games because she told you to, you immediately lose your power as a man [00:04:26]. A girl should never be the reason for your change [00:04:32].

### Stop Apologizing Unnecessarily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>

A common mistake is apologizing without reason or for trivial matters [00:04:38]. If you haven't done anything wrong, do not apologize [00:04:52]. Before apologizing, ask yourself if you genuinely made a mistake [00:05:10].

Here's how to handle different situations:

*   **When You Are at Fault:**
    *   **Situation 1: You did nothing wrong, but she's upset.** Do not apologize. Instead, tease her playfully and joke around [00:05:35].
    *   **Situation 2: You made a small mistake (e.g., forgetting a minor gift).** A brief "sorry" is sufficient. Give her space, and do not beg for forgiveness if she gets upset; let her come back to you naturally [00:05:43].
    *   **Situation 3: You made a very big mistake (e.g., cheating).** In this severe case, it is acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, perhaps with a gift or a visit to her place [00:06:09].

*   **When She Is at Fault:**
    *   **Situation 1: Minor offense.** Do not show any reaction, anger, or upset. Do not show that you care or engage in drama [00:06:28].
    *   **Situation 2: Small mistake (e.g., calling last minute to cancel a date).** Do not get angry, but hold her accountable [00:06:37]. For example, tell her, "You're messing up your chances with me," and hang up. If she calls back to apologize, demand an apology letter by email within 24 hours. If she refuses, end the interaction and do not contact her again unless she initiates it [00:06:43]. She should face consequences for her mistakes [00:07:07].
    *   **Situation 3: Big mistake (e.g., cheating).** Do not get angry, but immediately end the relationship [00:07:10]. Forgiving such a mistake will permanently erode her respect for you, and she may only stay to exploit you [00:07:17].

### Never Get Mad or Upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>

If a girl's actions can provoke anger or upset in you, it indicates that she is in control, not you [00:07:30]. Even if she says nasty things, never react by showing anger or losing your cool [00:07:42]. Be like "The Rock in the storm" and appear unaffected [00:07:49]. Often, she might be testing you to see your reaction to extreme situations; reacting predictably means you fail the test, lose your power, and lose her respect [00:07:53]. This contributes to [[strategies_for_maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | maintaining leadership in relationships]] and [[maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | leadership in relationships]].

## Component 2: Fear (The Kind She Enjoys) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

The concept linking investment, attraction, and respect is crucial here [00:08:15]. Many men mistakenly believe that their investment in a woman (expensive dates, gifts, constant attention) is what matters [00:08:27]. This often leads to the [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | friend zone]] while she is attracted to someone who puts in minimal effort [00:08:40].

The key insight is that **her investment in you** is what truly counts [00:08:56]. The more time, effort, and money *she* spends on *you*, the more attached *she* becomes [00:09:00]. When you constantly chase and try to impress her, she occupies your thoughts, but her feelings for you remain unchanged because she isn't investing [00:09:04]. If her investment does not increase, neither will her attraction or desire for you [00:09:12].

To [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | reverse the power dynamics]], you need to encourage her to invest in you [00:09:17]. While you still need to invest enough to make her comfortable, you should then allow her to take the lead in investing [00:09:24].

As she starts to invest in you, her fear of losing you grows [00:09:31]. This is a natural human tendency: the more we invest in something, the more we fear losing it [00:09:35]. Just as you would fear losing a piggy bank containing thousands of dollars more than one with only a few dollars, a woman's fear of losing you increases with her investment [00:09:39].

This fear is the second key component of "Emperor-like" respect [00:09:58]. When both **power** and this subtle, enjoyable **fear** are present, no woman will dare to disrespect you [00:10:00].

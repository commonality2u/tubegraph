To ensure a woman becomes deeply invested and attached in a [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]], one must make her emotionally invest as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. True intelligence and strength in a [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] involves making a woman give everything she has, see life through you, and dream about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This means making her suffer when you're not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

A key factor in a woman becoming obsessively attached to her partner is the amount of emotional investment she puts into the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Two Key Approaches to Encourage Emotional Investment

To foster deep emotional investment, one must approach a [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] with two "weapons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>:

1.  **Readiness to Walk Away**: Be prepared at any moment to leave the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This requires having an independent and fulfilling personal life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Without an independent life, one risks becoming overly attached, clingy, and emotionally shattered if the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. An exciting personal life ensures that the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] is merely an addition to an already great existence, allowing one to walk away if boundaries are crossed without being emotionally destroyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
2.  **Create a Cocktail of Mixed Emotions**: Intentionally introduce varied emotions throughout the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Emotion Cocktail: A Film-Inspired Approach

The most powerful tool for attracting people and making them deeply attached is the film industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Movies effectively trigger emotions through a well-defined [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | psychological pattern]] proven effective in stirring human emotions and maintaining emotional investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This pattern is also used in novels, TV series, and marketing strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### The Movie Story Pattern

Movies and novels often follow a structure that includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>:
*   A **normal state** where life is stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   The emergence of a **problem** that escalates the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
*   The **resolution** of the problem, returning life to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

This pattern creates a "roller coaster of mixed emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, making the viewer deeply invested. Applying this to a [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] can make you the center of a girl's world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### The "Quake and Magical Reconciliation" Formula

A [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] should consist of periods of stability where both partners feel love and routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This routine makes the girl feel safe and secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Then, suddenly, a "quake" occurs, shaking her world, followed immediately by a "magical reconciliation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

#### Example: Paul and Luna

In a [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] of two months, Luna was attracted to Paul's spontaneity and honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

*   **Stable Period**: Paul tells unbelievable, made-up stories, insisting they are real, but Luna pretends to go along with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Quake**: Paul calls Luna 24 hours later to confess he was lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Luna reacts with anger and frustration, ending the call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Magical Reconciliation**: The next day, Paul appears in front of Luna in her lecture hall, handing her a small box with earrings she wanted and an apology note, promising never to lie again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. This cinematic gesture resolves the situation, and Luna trusts him even more than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

#### Another Example of Quake and Reconciliation

Imagine a stable phase in your [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] that leads to a conflict and separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

*   **Quake**: During the separation, you meet and go out with another girl two or three times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. When you reconcile with your girlfriend, you admit to meeting someone else, causing her anxiety and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Magical Reconciliation**: You could get her name tattooed on your forearm and send her a picture, then let her touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Additionally, block the other girl and allow your girlfriend to discover it on her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

> [!TIP] The stronger the "quake," the more powerful the "magical reconciliation" needs to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### Who Reconciles?

*   **Beginning of the Relationship**: At the start of the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]], especially if you orchestrated the quake, you should initiate the reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Deeply Attached Phase**: Once she becomes deeply attached, you can create the quake and allow her to be the one to reconcile with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. For instance, if she ignores your messages, confront her in front of her friends, raise your voice, then leave as if the [[Dynamics of Romantic Relationships | relationship]] is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. When she realizes you're not making the first move, she will return to make amends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. At this point, you can take your time responding and set your conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

By applying these methods, it is suggested that a girl will find it impossible to leave or seek another partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

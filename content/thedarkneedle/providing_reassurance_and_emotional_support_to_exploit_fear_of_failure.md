This article explores psychological techniques to make individuals admire and become obsessed with you, focusing specifically on exploiting the "fear of failure" weak point through emotional reassurance and support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The knowledge provided can be used to become the center of attention or to manipulate people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Understanding Weak Points

Making someone obsessed or addicted to you requires [[leveraging_emotional_feedback_loops_and_reward_systems | triggering weak points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Every person has four weak points, with at least one typically being significantly stronger than the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Identifying and utilizing this dominant weak point can allow you to influence a person's most sensitive nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### How to Detect Weak Points in Conversation

To detect a person's weak points, observe their behavior during a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Normal behavior, including tone, speed, attention, and presence, can be interrupted by a "spike" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A spike signifies hitting a sensitive nerve and is characterized by a significant increase in their emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

Another indicator is when someone repeats a phrase or sentence twice, often because they didn't get the desired reaction from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. If these spikes or repetitions are directly related to them personally, it suggests an internal deficiency they are subconsciously waiting for someone to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## The Fear of Failure as a Weak Point

When individuals pursue a significant, life-changing goal (e.g., competitive university admission, a difficult job, or joining a music band), they often receive positive encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. However, regardless of how [[developing_a_confident_mindset | confident]] they appear, an internal voice often reminds them of the possibility of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This creates an internal "hole" that, if filled, can make you essential to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### Recognizing the Internal Void

For example, a person pursuing web development dreams of succeeding in their field and earning a high salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. While they receive external encouragement, they will naturally express their fears of failure if you are a good listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Ineffective Responses: Why Advice-Giving Fails

Most people, upon hearing someone discuss their problems, immediately offer solutions or advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is the wrong approach for exploiting the fear of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Advice should only be given when explicitly asked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

There are three scenarios when someone discusses a problem:
1.  **Seeking Advice**: They directly ask for your opinion or guidance (e.g., "Do you know any way to gain weight?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Your response should be to help find a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
2.  **Venting About a Past Problem**: They share a bad experience, sad story, or a problem with no current solution (e.g., "My boss treats me terribly") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. In this case, simply listen without offering solutions, acting uninterested, or changing the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.
3.  **Emotional Problems (like Fear of Failure)**: The problem is not just logical but emotional (e.g., stress about job uncertainty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This scenario requires emotional reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Effective Strategy: Emotional Reassurance

The best way to address the fear of failure is through emotional reassurance and lifting their spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Reassurance serves as the "bait" for this weak point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## How to Give Proper Reassurance

Proper reassurance involves two key steps:

### Step 1: Listen

When someone expresses their fear of failure, stay silent initially and let them talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Listening first is crucial before offering hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Step 2: Provide Hope Through Stories

After listening, offer hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. The most effective method is to tell stories of people who were in similar or worse situations but still succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE]
> If someone fears failing at web development due to exhaustion and complex programming languages, you could say:
> *   "My cousin was in the same position as you, and now he's an engineer at Microsoft. He was just like you and honestly he wasn't even working as hard as you are right now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
> *   If they reply, "But I'm exhausted and there are so many programming languages I need to learn and I just don't understand them well enough," you can respond, "I get it, my cousin felt the same way. He also didn't understand anything at first, but little by little he got the hang of it. Eventually it all made sense to him." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>

These stories can be about real people you know or entirely fictional, based on your own principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

## The Addiction Mechanism

Hitting a person's weak points is compared to giving them a drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. When the effect wears off, their brain returns to its normal state and starts craving more of that "drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Their brain then associates you with this experience, leading them to subconsciously desire more interaction with you, effectively becoming addicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This mechanism explains how consistent reassurance can [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | create strong emotional connections]] and make someone obsessed with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

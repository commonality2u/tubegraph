## Building Confidence Before the Approach

To successfully approach women, it's crucial to maintain calmness in all situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. A relaxed demeanor often leads to positive outcomes, whereas nervousness can diminish [[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]] and result in rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For those new to approaching women in social settings, developing the right mindset can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

The most effective way to overcome the fear of [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching women]] is to take action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Begin with small steps rather than jumping into full conversations immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### Confidence-Building Exercise
A practical exercise to [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | build confidence]] involves approaching 10 women daily and simply asking them for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To make this effective, ensure you're not wearing a watch and turn off your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This straightforward practice can significantly boost your [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]], leading to a greater sense of ease within a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It's also beneficial to perform this exercise a few minutes before you intend to engage in more substantial conversations, as it enhances your comfort level when [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

## [[choosing_the_right_setting_for_approaching_women | Choosing the Right Setting]]

When practicing the confidence-building exercise or seeking to talk to women, selecting an appropriate location is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Asking for the time in nightclubs might not be ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Instead, opt for calmer environments such as parks, malls, or coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Avoid Nightclubs for Beginners
For those new to [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching women]], it's advisable to avoid nightclubs initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Entering such venues without prior experience can lead to disappointment and discouragement due to:
*   **High competition:** Many other men are attempting to do the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Defensive attitudes:** Women may be on guard because they are frequently approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Loud music:** Makes conversation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Recommended Settings
Consider places that are more conducive for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>:
*   **Hobby classes:** Yoga, salsa dancing, or aerobics classes often have more women than men, providing better opportunities for practice without intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Casual public spaces:** Restaurants, coffee shops, public libraries, or malls are also suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

Once you've chosen a location, identify a woman you'd like to approach. While approaching someone in a group can be more challenging than approaching an individual, don't let this deter your choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

## The Approach: Timing and Angle

An important tip for a successful approach is to act within 5 seconds of deciding to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Waiting longer increases the likelihood that your brain will generate excuses, allowing insecurities to take over and potentially preventing the approach altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Hesitation only leads to increased nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Common Approach Mistakes to Avoid
Many rejections occur because guys don't know the proper way to approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Direct, upfront approaches:** Staring, walking directly towards her, and immediately asking for a drink or her number often result in rejection, as women are conditioned to turn down such direct advances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This also makes women assume you're only interested in casual encounters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Canned pickup lines:** Witty pickup lines rarely work and often lead to more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
*   **Approaching from the front:** If she sees you "charging" towards her, she will put up a wall of resistance before you even speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Approaching from behind:** Touching her shoulder or starting a conversation without notice from behind can scare her and ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### The Key: Making Her Comfortable
The key to a successful approach is to make her comfortable in your presence *before* moving on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. If you try too hard, she'll sense something "fishy" and raise her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### The Best Way to Approach
Always approach a woman from the **side** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This method doesn't scare her and prevents her from anticipating your approach and putting up her guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Technique:** Walk past her, tilt your head in her direction, and begin the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   **Posture:** Ensure your chest is facing the other direction, meaning you're talking over your shoulder. This non-threatening posture makes her more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Starting the Conversation: Natural Openers

Direct approaches rarely work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. To initiate conversations, act in a manner that shows you're not trying to "hit on" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Avoid rigid reliance on "canned openers" and instead observe the environment and her actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The best way to open conversations is to be as natural as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Example Openers:
*   **The "Phone Call" Opener:**
    1.  Pretend to be on your cell phone, talking to someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    2.  As you pass your target, look over your shoulder and pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    3.  Hold the phone to your ear and say, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    4.  Then, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men, is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    5.  After her response, hang up and say, "I'm in a hurry, but my friend said never to trust anything a female says, half the time she would be lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    6.  She will likely disagree, allowing you to respond, "Yeah, I mean it can't apply to all females" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   This successfully opens the conversation and gains her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Stating you're in a hurry lowers her defenses and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Environment-Based Opener (e.g., restaurant):**
    *   Approach her and ask about what she's eating or drinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.
    *   "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>
    *   "I'm new to this place and can't really figure out what to order. I think I should order this dish, is there anything else you can suggest?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   **Observation-Based Opener (e.g., neutral environment):**
    *   Observe what she's wearing and comment on it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on. What's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
    *   After her response, "Yeah, it caught my attention, that's why I asked you about it. By the way, I'm John." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>
*   **Guessing/Assumption Opener:**
    *   Instead of asking "What do you do?" or "Where are you from?", guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>
    *   When she asks why, "Well, you have the Californian look about you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>
    *   "Well, look at the way you're dressed. I have a friend who dresses exactly like you and she is from California too. All you guys tend to dress like Barbie dolls, why is that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:08:02]</a>
    *   A guess or assumption will often prompt her to ask "Why do you say that?", successfully opening the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Escalating the Interaction

After successfully opening a conversation, the next challenge is to prevent awkward silence and keep her interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. Simply engaging in casual talk won't create strong emotional attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Apply techniques such as:
*   The qualifying technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
*   The listen like a therapist technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>
*   Positive body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   The push and pull technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
*   Creating mystery (tell her a bit, leave her wanting more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>

### Engaging with Groups
When [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | approaching women]] in groups, a highly effective technique is to talk more to the target's friend than to the target herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Most guys focus solely on their target, ignoring her friends, which makes their interest obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. By spending more time on the target's friends, you make the target feel a bit jealous and curious, forcing her to work for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

**Example:**
1.  Approach the group and say to your target, "Hey, are they your friends?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
2.  After she confirms, say, "Be a good girl, introduce me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>
3.  She will likely introduce you. Immediately start talking more to one of her friends and completely avoid the target for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
4.  Within minutes, you'll observe the target trying harder to get your attention, indicating her curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Physical Touch
[[effective_communication_with_women | Physical touch]] is vital for attraction; it doubles the impact of your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Once a woman allows you to touch her, her defenses are lowered, making her more receptive to further physical escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

**Easy Physical Touch Routines:**
*   **Hands:** Stare at her hands, then gently grab her fingers and say, "Oh, nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Forehead:** Stare at her forehead and say, "You have something on your forehead." When she asks what, do a slight cleanup with your fingers and say, "Okay, all clean now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Hair:** Stare at her hair and say, "Wow, nice color," or "How did you get it curly like that? Is this real hair?" Then touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **High Five:** Say, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team, give me a high five," and give her a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Getting Her Phone Number

If you've established good conversation and built attraction, getting her phone number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The Technique
1.  Transition the conversation into an interesting story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
2.  During the story, say, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," then continue your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  Keep her curious; tell her you'll share what you noticed after the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.
4.  When the story ends, she'll likely ask again. Check the time and say, "Oh, I'm running late, I have to go." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>
5.  Hand her your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   This technique encourages her to enter her number because she's interested in continuing the conversation and learning what you noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.
    *   Handing her your phone ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. You can even call it quickly to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Handling Refusal or Incorrect Numbers
*   If she gives a wrong number: Say, "Oh, playing, aren't we?" If she apologizes and offers to correct it, you can respond, "No, never mind, I don't want it. It was great meeting you," and walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   If she totally refuses: This indicates you haven't built enough attraction. You can try once more: "Come on, giddy up, I don't have much time here." If she still refuses, politely say goodbye and walk off immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

### Provide a Motive
Always provide a motive for her to give you her number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Example:** "My friends are having this party on Saturday. It's one of the coolest events which happens only once a year. I have free passes, you should come." Then, hand her your phone: "Here, punch in your number. I'll let you know the timings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   Randomly asking "Can I have your phone number?" often leads to rejection or her not remembering you later, as it doesn't create enough attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Post-Number Acquisition
Once you've obtained her phone number, it's important to exit the venue immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This prevents an awkward second encounter and ensures that the attraction you've built doesn't reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

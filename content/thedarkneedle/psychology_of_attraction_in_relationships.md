This article explores the [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | psychology of women's attraction]] and what actions can lead to attraction and attachment in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Role of "Drama" in Attraction

The key to making a woman "love you and go crazy for you" is "drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. [[Psychological dynamics of attraction | Drama]] is defined as what stirs a girl's emotions, makes her think about you, and is crucial for her to fall in love and stay attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Women are emotional beings driven by feelings, and stirring their emotions in specific ways can cause their brain to release love hormones, leading to attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This "recipe" for attraction requires all "ingredients" to be present, otherwise, she may lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

## The Source of Emotions

It is critical that *you* are the source of the emotions a woman feels, rather than external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. External emotions, such as those felt when visiting a beautiful place or watching an emotional movie, do not foster attraction towards you; they attract her to the external source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The feelings she experiences should be woven into your conversations and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Key Emotional Ingredients

### 1. Excitement

Excitement is created by mixing attention with a touch of indifference in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This involves both complimenting and critiquing in a way that stirs emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Instead of direct compliments or criticisms, combine interest and disinterest:
- **Showing Interest:** Start with indifference, end with interest. Example: "If this dress were pink it would be better, but still it looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The last part of a statement is often remembered most vividly, making the comment positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
- **Showing Disinterest:** Start with interest, end with indifference. Example: "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This signals interest without appearing to "chase" her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
- **Creating Emotional Fluctuation:** Statements like "You're so short, but still you're adorable" cause an initial dip followed by a rise in emotions, which creates excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

Complete attention can be shown when she does something you like (e.g., wearing a preferred color) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### 2. Being Enjoyable

For a woman to associate you with exciting and fun thoughts, you must enjoy your time first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
- **Mindset Shift:** Avoid trying too hard to make her laugh or entertain, as this can lead to being seen as just a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Be positive, relaxed, and spontaneous, focusing on what amuses you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
- **Talk About What You Love:** Your emotions are a reflection of hers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. Discussing your passions creates joy and enthusiasm in you, which she will also feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
- **Turn Negativity into Positivity:**
    1. Notice a flaw or negative aspect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
    2. Point it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
    3. Transform it into something positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    Example: "Do you always wear this much makeup...? Don't worry, you still look cute with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This often results in laughter and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### 3. [[Creating psychological intrigue in relationships | Curiosity / Intrigue]]

This is created through two main techniques:
- **Unfinished Conversation:** Spark intense interest, then pull back at the peak of excitement, leaving her eager to know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Examples include promising to tell something important later or leaving a story incomplete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This leverages women's desire for instant gratification, increasing their excitement, curiosity, and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
- **Strategic Date Ending:** End a date when it's still enjoyable, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Crucially, leave without promising another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This creates uncertainty about your interest, making her think about you and wonder why you didn't ask for another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Not Revealing Feelings Too Early

Never reveal your feelings to a woman too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. While movies suggest honesty is best, in real life, confessing love too soon can kill attraction by removing the element of mystery and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Her uncertainty about your true feelings is a primary factor in her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

If she confesses her love, it's acceptable to show reciprocal interest, but she should still want you more than you want her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This is achieved by demonstrating a willingness to walk away if your principles are violated, indicating high value and sufficient options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Maintaining Mystery

Keep her eager to learn more by keeping her in a constant state of guessing through mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This means not giving away too much information too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
- **Example Response:** Instead of a direct answer to "Where do you work?", try "Guess, and if you get it right I'll pay for dinner here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This adds intrigue and can effortlessly lead to another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
- **General Rule:** Gradually decrease the level of mystery over time, but always maintain some degree of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. For example, don't immediately disclose all details of your activities or whereabouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

### 4. Jealousy

A woman should feel jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
- **Before a Serious Relationship:** If she asks if you're dating others, admit it: "Yes, there are a few girls I go out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This makes her jealous and pushes her to work harder to keep you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
- **In an Exclusive Relationship:** Occasionally talk to other women or have female friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. If she expresses jealousy, clarify that she is the one who truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
Women enjoy competition and feeling like they are the "winner," which makes them see you as a "prize" and increases their attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### 5. Safety

A girl will not enter a physical relationship unless she feels comfortable and safe with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
- **Authenticity:** The most essential tip is to ensure your presentation aligns with your true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. Acting fake or going against your nature to impress her (e.g., feigning interest in pop music you don't care about) will make you seem untrustworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. Being honest with your personality makes her feel safe and trust you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
- **Shared Experiences:** Choosing a horror movie to watch together can create a sense of security, as she will cling to you when scared, and your calm demeanor will make her feel safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>.

### 6. Challenge / Respect

Don't be afraid to engage in debate or disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Always agreeing with her signals a lack of self-respect, fear of negative consequences, and suggests you believe you're not good enough to risk losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Women seek a challenge, and constant agreement makes you unchallenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>.

## Overall Strategy: Unpredictability and Balance

A good mix of all these emotions is the perfect recipe for long-term attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. Avoid letting any single emotion dominate, as this can lead to boredom and a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. To evoke these emotions, be unpredictable in your actions and always maintain a slight sense of mystery in your conversations, behavior, and self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Keep the woman guessing about your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

When navigating the dating world, many individuals find themselves searching for a partner who embodies a specific list of desired qualities, often influenced by societal terms like "red flags" and "green flags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. However, the speaker recounts a personal experience of trying to find a girl who matched a pre-defined list of "red flags" to avoid and "green flags" to seek, which proved unsuccessful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The fundamental assertion is that it's impossible to find a person who perfectly aligns with every single desire, and rigid lists, such as "she shouldn't have male friends," are deemed "nonsense" and impractical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Instead of an exhaustive checklist, the focus shifts to understanding true red flags that indicate an unchangeable trait that will lead to suffering, and personal preferences that can be managed within the relationship dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. This requires a strategy where a man should be the leader in the relationship, guiding the dynamic without resorting to force or manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Expressing Personal Preferences

[[expressing_personal_preferences_in_dating | Expressing personal preferences in dating]] effectively requires a specific approach: "You tell her what you want, but you don't force it on her. At the same time, you should not need her to do what you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This involves three key ideas: how to tell her, how not to force it, and how not to show need.

### How to Tell Her Your Preference

The most crucial rule is to not reveal your preferences until she asks you directly, allowing the relationship to develop naturally first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. For example, if you dislike revealing clothing, wait until she asks about your clothing preferences or the topic arises organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

When she asks:
*   **State your opinion clearly and simply:** Do not justify yourself or try to convince her with arguments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Simply state it as your taste and step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   **Maintain your stance:** Do not change your opinion, even under pressure. Changing your stance signals a loss of leadership and attraction from her perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

### How Not to Force It

When expressing a preference, avoid making it seem like a major issue or a deal-breaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Communicate it in a "cold and indifferent manner," as if simply sharing what you like, without implying that a relationship would end if she doesn't conform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### How Not to Show Your Need

It's vital not to convey that you *need* her to change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If she doesn't immediately adopt your preference (e.g., still wears revealing clothes), do not mention it, talk about it, or give it any attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This indifference signals that you don't *need* the change, prompting her to question why you haven't brought it up and potentially leading her to make the change on her own as her attachment to you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## True Red Flags to Avoid

While personal preferences can be influenced, there are certain "red flags" that indicate unchangeable traits and significant suffering for a man in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. These are critical to understand for [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | understanding the dynamics of dating]].

### 1. Flirting with Other Men

If a woman flirts with other men in your presence, she is likely seeking attention or trying to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This behavior often leads to drama and will not cease over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. It's crucial not to show jealousy, as that validates her goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 2. Still Attached to Her Ex

A girl who frequently talks about her ex, hasn't moved on, or expresses a desire to reconcile with him carries significant emotional baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. In such cases, it's best to have a friendly conversation and suggest she explore reconciliation with her ex, demonstrating that you are a high-value man willing to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Maintaining a relationship with someone still attached to an ex will lead to continuous drama and negatively impact your relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### 3. Energy Sucking Women

This is considered the most dangerous red flag, referring to women who are full of problems and constantly seek validation due to deep-seated insecurities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. They have an "endless emotional hunger" that can never be satisfied, no matter how much attention or appreciation you give them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This often manifests in:
*   **Using sex for validation:** They may offer easy sex to boost their self-esteem, often sleeping with multiple men to feel admired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Drama and manipulation:** Such women are often "drama queens" capable of turning perfect situations into chaos and may resort to manipulation due to feelings of unworthiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

It is crucial to filter out this type of woman based on her personality rather than just looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, and to walk away immediately for your emotional health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

## Understanding When a Woman Talks About Other Men

A common confusion in [[effective_communication_with_women | effective communication with women]] arises when a woman talks about other men. There are two primary reasons:

1.  **Trying to show desirability:** If a new acquaintance mentions a guy who approached her and complimented her, she is likely trying to impress you and signal that she is desired by other men. Her aim is often for you to ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.
2.  **Friend-zoning or emotional baggage:** If she talks about an ex, how much she loved him, or how she wants him back, she is likely trying to "dump her emotions on you" and put you in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. This indicates genuine interest in another man and heavy emotional baggage, making it a clear sign to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

[[effective_communication_strategies | Effective communication strategies]] and [[communication_strategies_in_relationships | communication strategies in relationships]] are vital for navigating dating. It's crucial to distinguish between true red flags, which signal unchangeable traits and future suffering, and preferences that can be managed through assertive, non-needy communication. The foundation for [[effective_communication_strategies_in_relationships | effective communication strategies in relationships]] and [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotional communication in relationships]] rests on the man maintaining his leadership position and core principles, allowing the woman to align herself out of her own will as her attachment grows.

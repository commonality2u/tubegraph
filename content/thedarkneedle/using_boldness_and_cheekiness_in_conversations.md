This article explores the concept of "impudence" as a powerful communication style that can make a woman chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Impudence is defined as a lack of modesty or [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] with a slight disregard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Why Impudence Attracts Women

From an instinctive perspective, a woman perceives an impudent man as capable of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Attraction is instinctive and not based on logic or modern-day principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. The primary trait women seek in a man is his ability to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. In a survival scenario, the "harsh" or "selfish" individual who prioritizes his own survival is more likely to succeed than the overly kind and peaceful one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Women would instinctively gravitate towards such a person because he represents the highest chance of survival for them too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Even in modern times, where physical survival is less of a daily concern, these genetic instincts remain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Impudence]] and [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] are traits that lead a woman to deeply love and become attached to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When a woman senses this type of [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] and [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | impudence]], she can become obsessively attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This should be conveyed through speech, especially early in interactions, but always with moderation and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Four Elements of Impudence in Conversation

Impudence in conversation is composed of four key elements:

### 1. Be a Little Cheeky
Being cheeky involves adopting a mischievous manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This means saying or doing things that make someone wonder, "Did he really just say/do that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This approach aims to "break the mold" and snap her out of a "boredom trance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Most people are used to formal interactions, and by being unexpected, you grab her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Cheekiness involves showing too much familiarity too early, acting as if you don't know your place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Many men do the opposite, being overly careful and formal, which leads to them being seen as strangers, hindering emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

*   **Avoid Neutrality:** If you disagree with someone, state it directly and stick to your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Neutrality is perceived as weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Influential people are often extreme in their opinions, not neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   **Offer Unsolicited Advice:** A powerful way to be cheeky is to offer advice that wasn't asked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. For example, telling a blonde-haired girl, "You'd look really beautiful with black hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This creates a shocking and surprising emotional response because it's an unexpected display of excessive familiarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Women rarely experience surprise in initial conversations with men, as they've often had similar conversations repeatedly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This type of advice isn't rude but is edgy, making her think and engage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 2. Be Bold
[[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Boldness]] is considered the most attractive trait to all humans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Being bold means taking a risk, whether it's a real risk, potential embarrassment, or something similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key is to fully live in the present moment, focusing all energy on the action without dwelling on future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

In interactions with women, you must be the one to take the first step in everything, from initiating conversation and flirting to making physical moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Even simple bold actions can significantly impact those around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. People are drawn to bold individuals because they are unexpected, breaking the monotony of repetition which people dislike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

*   **Verbal Boldness:**
    *   If a girl is talking too much or raising her voice, you can boldly say, "Shut your trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is a phrase typically reserved for friends, shocking a stranger and making her pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   If you notice a girl looking at you, a bold statement like "I just totally caught you staring at me" can be playfully audacious and pull her out of her routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This demonstrates [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] and can lead to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   The sooner you are bold in a conversation, the more you can set an emotionally charged, attractive tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### 3. Be Shameless
[[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Shamelessness]] means having the courage to say things as they are and voicing your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It's akin to a child pointing out something everyone else is thinking but is too shy to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Shamelessness is saying what's not "supposed to be said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

*   **Attractive vs. Dumb Shamelessness:** It's crucial to distinguish between attractive [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | shamelessness]] and rude stupidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Attractive [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | shamelessness]] involves saying what you're thinking as long as it doesn't hurt anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For example, calling someone "fat" or "crippled" is hurtful and stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Smart Shamelessness Examples:**
    *   Referencing something she said earlier and sharing your uncensored reaction: "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
    *   Asking a personal, unexpected question like, "Does that mean you don't shave your legs?" when she mentions girls' night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This can escalate the conversation to a deeper, perhaps sexual, level because you dared to ask something "not supposed to be said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
    *   Pointing out an obvious physical trait with humor, like remarking on someone's height: "I didn't see you. I didn't notice at first that you're short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This shows you're not ashamed to say what's on your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   "Connecting the dots" by filling in what someone left out of a story, such as suggesting "the sex got boring or no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" when she describes a failed dating app encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Point Out the Elephant in the Room:** A key piece of advice is to always point out what everyone is thinking but is too shy to say, especially in mixed groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### 4. Be Slightly Disrespectful
To fully master impudence, you must be slightly disrespectful, but this does not mean being insulting or treating her badly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Instead, it means giving her the same level of respect you would give your best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

*   **Avoid Over-Respect:** Most men treat women with excessive respect, similar to how they would treat an elementary school principal, walking on eggshells around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This prevents any emotional reaction from sparking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Over-respect can make a woman believe she is better than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The ideal approach is to treat her like a close friend, even if you just met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.
*   **Indirect Responses:** One way to be slightly disrespectful is by not directly responding to her questions immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many men feel obliged to give long, thoughtful replies to every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Instead, if she asks "So, where did you grow up?", you can divert the conversation with a statement like "Oh, so last night I was out..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
    *   You can return to her question later to build connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
    *   This shows you control the conversation and makes it more interesting by being non-linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   It creates a gap and allows for surprise, which triggers attraction and a sense of fun and unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
    *   It also makes her feel like she needs to win you over, proving you won't easily submit just because she's attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

By applying these principles of impudence—being cheeky, bold, shameless, and slightly disrespectful—you can convey that you are a strong man who doesn't fear and doesn't give excessive attention, leading women to chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

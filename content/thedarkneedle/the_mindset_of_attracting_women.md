Attracting women is presented as being far simpler than commonly perceived, requiring a shift away from superficial tips and a return to fundamental principles of [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Success in attracting women is fundamentally a state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. What one feels internally will manifest in one's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Core Principle: "She Feels What You Feel"

Women do not judge men based on their looks, words, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Instead, they evaluate a man based on the feelings circulating within him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. These internal feelings are reflected in one's [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | personality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. For instance, nervousness significantly increases the chance of rejection because the woman senses a lack of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Conversely, an approach that is confident, calm, and relaxed will likely elicit a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Therefore, it is crucial to demonstrate that you consider yourself a man whom women naturally desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Avoiding the Pursuit of Approval

One of the significant [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | mistakes to avoid when attracting women]] is placing a woman on a pedestal and pandering to her every whim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If a man finds himself saying things he shouldn't or going out of his way to impress, it often indicates an underlying sense of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

The most effective way to impress a woman is by *not* trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. When a man stops actively seeking her approval, that is when she becomes genuinely impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This is because women are accustomed to men trying to woo them; therefore, a lack of such efforts stands out and captures their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

The quest for validation stems from self-perception and [[body_language_and_selfconfidence_in_attracting_women | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Men who constantly seek approval often struggle with low self-esteem, trading their own power for acceptance from women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This often implies an underlying fear of rejection, even before an interaction begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. The moment a woman senses a man is craving her approval, she can lose interest almost immediately, as this desperate need for approval acts as a major [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attraction]] deterrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>.

## Indifference to Outcome

Men who effortlessly attract women do not attach themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Rejection is viewed as an insignificant part of the dating landscape that does not perturb them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their primary concern is to enjoy the experience itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. When indifferent to the outcome, a man does not worry about a woman's reaction, focusing instead on maximizing the enjoyment of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Valuing Yourself and Your Principles

It is common for men to lose composure around an attractive woman, often awarding them extra points simply for their looks, which were not necessarily earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Behaving unusually or nervously around an attractive woman can lead to fumbling and ruining the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

Instead, avoiding undue niceness based solely on looks can create an intriguing phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. When a man doesn't readily offer validation like the average guy, a woman may begin to seek his validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This indirectly leads her to believe she might need to prove her worth, immediately categorizing the man as different and unique, thus fostering genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## The Man with Options

A man who truly understands [[understanding_womens_attraction_to_men_with_options | attraction]] never settles for less than what he desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He actively chooses the women he dates, maintaining high standards rather than accepting whoever is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

A "high-value man" prioritizes his principles above all else, even above the woman he is with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He is unafraid to withdraw if his principles are violated, understanding that there are many other options available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. He is confident in his self-worth and prepared to stand alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

## Making Her Strive for Your Attention

Humans tend to value things they work hard to obtain more than things given effortlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. This applies to relationships: women tend to value men they have to exert effort to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. When a man doesn't react like the average person, a woman begins to perceive something special about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

It is crucial to learn how to make a woman strive for your attention, rather than being an open book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. One strategy is to show interest and then quickly show disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This challenges her and provokes a strong emotional reaction, making her curious and eager to learn more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

## Authenticity and Self-Reality

A common [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | mistake]] is modifying one's behavior or lifestyle to suit a woman's preferences, often out of fear of not meeting her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Adapting to a woman's preferences implies viewing her as higher value and that one needs to change to match her value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The truth is, a man should not alter himself to make a woman feel at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[0:10:10]</a>. If she doesn't appreciate certain aspects, she doesn't deserve him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[0:10:14]</a>. If she wants to be with him, she should adapt to his reality, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[0:10:24]</a>. A high-value man shapes his own reality and follows his own course, unconcerned with others' opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. He understands the abundance of attractive women and doesn't fixate on one, seeing opportunities rather than scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

[[mindset_shifts_for_dating_success | These mindset shifts]] are critical for leveling up one's dating game, emphasizing that theory must be put into practice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

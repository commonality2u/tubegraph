To succeed in dating and relationships, it is crucial to avoid common pitfalls such as lacking clarity about one's desires, wasting time on undeserving pursuits, being overly agreeable, failing to lead oneself, and lacking a strong moral code <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A significant part of overcoming these mistakes involves [[importance_of_confrontation_and_setting_boundaries | being assertive and setting clear boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Setting High Expectations and Standards

A common mistake is not knowing what one is truly looking for in a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Without a clear definition of what constitutes a "great woman," individuals tend to accept whatever is available rather than what is right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This leads to settling, which is described as slow-motion self-sabotage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

To avoid this:
*   **Define your ideal partner**: Create a detailed list of qualities, beliefs, and behaviors you seek in a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This includes how she treats you, what lights you up, and what kind of love would nourish you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This list should be ruthlessly specific to act as a filter, compass, and blueprint <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **[[managing_expectations_in_relationships | Set high expectations]]**: Always put a high price on yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. High expectations prevent others from walking all over you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.
*   **Make others work for your attention**: When your expectations are high, you'll naturally make others strive for your attention instead of the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Do not compromise**: Do not allow someone into your life who does not meet your expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. It's vital to keep a woman "on her toes" to match your standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Address undesirable behavior**: [[importance_of_confrontation_and_setting_boundaries | Punish bad behavior]] every single time without exception to maintain attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Having clear standards transforms you into a man who attracts women who match and see his worth, rather than chasing or begging for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Avoiding the "Nice Guy" Trap

Being overly agreeable and constantly seeking to please women is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This behavior, often stemming from a fear of rejection or disapproval, is perceived as weakness, not kindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### The Importance of Saying "No"
*   **Stand your ground**: A good man knows when to say no without flinching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. You are not meant to be an emotional support animal or to constantly make her comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   **Lead, protect, challenge**: Your role is to lead, protect, and sometimes challenge, which may involve telling her what she needs to hear, even if it's not what she wants to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
*   **Create tension**: Real men know how to create tension with purpose, which builds desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Enforcing Boundaries
Women inherently test [[setting_boundaries in relationships | boundaries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. If you fail to [[handling_womens_requests_and_maintaining_personal_boundaries | enforce your boundaries]], she will lose respect, and attraction will fade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

*   **Operate from power**: Stop seeking approval and start operating from a position of power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **Be firm and clear**: When you say "no," mean it, don't explain it, and maintain your frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The ability to walk away signifies strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.
*   **No doormats**: You don't need to be a jerk, but you cannot be a doormat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Be [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | firm, clear, and unshakable]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This approach attracts better women who are drawn to your strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Self-Leadership and Personal Character

Leading yourself is fundamental to attracting high-quality women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Women are instinctively drawn to men who possess leadership qualities, direction, and a strong mission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This means taking responsibility for your own life, making decisions swiftly and firmly, and acting without being prompted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Beyond leadership, your character and code of ethics are paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. A woman's trust is built on consistency between your words and actions, proving you are who you say you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. She needs to know your foundation won't crack under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

*   **Live by a code**: Your character is defined by your thought habits, actions, and daily choices, especially when no one is watching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Living by a personal code, like the Roman cardinal virtues (justice, prudence, fortitude, and temperance), builds a principle-based spine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.
*   **Virtuous living**: To attract a high-quality woman, you must be a high-quality, virtuous man yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.

Focusing on self-improvement and truly understanding yourself is essential for living a good life and succeeding, including in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

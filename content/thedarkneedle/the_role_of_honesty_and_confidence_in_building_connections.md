When attempting to build a connection, particularly with a romantic interest, a common mistake is to make the other person the "main character" in the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This often stems from a societal brainwashing that portrays women as the ultimate reward for success or effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, leading individuals to place women on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Adopting the "Main Character" Mindset

To foster genuine connections, it is crucial to adopt the mindset: "I am the main character. She's just a side quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This perspective encourages seeing yourself as the central figure in your own story, with others, including romantic interests, serving to add enjoyment to your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This isn't about arrogance, but about a shift in self-perception that influences [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence in social interactions]].

It's important to understand the underlying principles of human interaction rather than simply memorizing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. By understanding how people think, you can naturally develop your own effective strategies for [[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | communication skills and charisma development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Choosing Conversation Topics

A fundamental rule in conversation is that the person with more perceived value is the one who chooses the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Many people make the mistake of trying to impress someone by talking about their interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, which often leads to being "friend-zoned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Instead, talk about topics you genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. If the other person mentions something they like, and you don't share that interest, don't fake it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Instead, inquire about their emotional connection to the topic, such as "What do you like about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The goal is to speak about [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotions]], not just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This approach encourages [[using_empathy_and_understanding_to_build_connections | using empathy and understanding to build connections]].

> "Never talk with a girl about something you don't care about just to impress her or to get her attention. Always remember you must always see yourself as the main character." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

### Not Needing to Prove Anything

A crucial aspect of the "main character" mindset is understanding that you do not need to prove anything to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. This gives the impression that the other person is not the most important thing in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

*   If someone challenges your story, don't try to convince them; simply agree playfully and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
*   If someone interrupts you, let them talk. Don't try to force your way back to your original point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This non-reaction communicates that their opinion isn't paramount to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
*   In group settings, if you're interrupted, it means the group isn't interested in what you were saying, so there's no need to repeat yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

This reinforces the idea that you are the main character, and your well-being isn't dependent on others' validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

## The Power of Complete Honesty

[[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships | Complete honesty]] is a powerful tool for building strong connections and fostering attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Lying implies that the other person holds higher value in your eyes, as you care about their opinion or are afraid of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Most people, especially attractive women, expect men to lie at some point due to past experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When someone encounters genuine honesty, it stands out and makes them question your motivations and the source of your [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Honesty Under Pressure

True honesty is best demonstrated when it puts you in a potentially bad light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Humans assess character by observing behavior under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

*   Admitting a loss in a fight makes you appear more honest than fabricating a victory, as it shows honesty even when it's embarrassing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   A gym-goer demonstrated this by honestly answering "to get girls" when asked why he works out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This unexpected honesty made the listening girl feel he was genuine and didn't care about her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, leading to a long conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

> "If you want to appear honest, you have to learn how to say the uncomfortable truth." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>

Being honest, especially in situations where it puts you under pressure, demonstrates that you are the main character and are extremely [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | confident]] in yourself, unconcerned with others' opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This approach contributes significantly to [[building_connections_and_nonverbal_communication | building connections]] and showing [[importance_of_social_skills_for_success | social skills for success]].

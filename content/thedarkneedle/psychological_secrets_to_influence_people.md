This article reveals [[psychological techniques for forming attachments|psychological secrets]] that can make anyone like, admire, and even become obsessed with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The information can be used to become the most important person in your environment or to [[emotional manipulation techniques|manipulate people]] to fulfill your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The responsibility for how this knowledge is used rests solely with the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## From Liking to Obsession

While general social skills can make someone like you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>, making someone obsessed with you—addicted and eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to talk—requires a specific skill called "triggering weak points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

### Triggering Weak Points
Every human being possesses four weak points, and in 99% of people, at least one of these is significantly stronger than the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The key is to identify and exploit this dominant weak point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

#### Detecting Weak Points: The "Spike"
Detecting a person's weak point involves observing their behavior during conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Normal human behavior is like a straight line, but a "spike" occurs when something sensitive is hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

A "spike" is a significant increase in emotional response, noticed as a change in tone of voice, speech speed, attention, or presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. It can also be indicated by them repeating a phrase or sentence twice, especially if they didn't get the desired reaction from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. If these spikes or repetitions are directly related to them personally, it indicates a "gap in their defenses"—an internal deficiency they subconsciously want someone to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

#### The Four Types of Weak Points
Recognizing these weak points allows you to pinpoint a person's void just by listening to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

##### 1. The Thirst for Validation
Some individuals develop an excessive thirst for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. They constantly try to prove their uniqueness and seek admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, often bragging about achievements or social conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. They typically enjoy feeling in control of their social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

*   **Exploitation:** The bait for this weak point is intelligent, indirect praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.
    *   **Incorrect Praise:** Direct compliments like "Your style is nice" are useless and make you seem like you're sucking up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Their effect is temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
    *   **Correct Praise:** Praise should be indirect, making the person *feel* praised rather than just hearing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
        *   **Seek Advice:** Ask for their advice on a problem (real or made-up). When they offer a solution, respond with "Wow, you're absolutely right! I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This makes them feel intellectually superior and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
        *   **Third-Party Validation:** Introduce a third party's observation. For example, if they run 6 miles, instead of praising them directly, stay silent. When they ask why you're silent, say, "The other day, Henry and I were talking about you, and we were debating whether you could run 6 miles without stopping. He told me 6 miles is a really big number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This makes them feel validated, appreciated, and keeps them thinking about the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
        *   **Joking Praise:** Joke about something they are proud of. If they are tall, say "How's the weather up there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. If they got a girl's number, joke about it later, "Dude, how did you even pull that off?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This reinforces their pride playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

People with a thirst for validation are the easiest to [[emotional manipulation techniques|manipulate]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

##### 2. The Fear of Failure
Individuals with big life-changing goals often harbor an internal voice reminding them that failure is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This fear creates a "hole" within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

*   **Exploitation:** Filling this "hole" makes you like a drug they depend on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The bait is emotional reassurance and lifting their spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   **Do NOT Give Advice:** Most people offer solutions or advice when someone talks about problems, but this is the wrong approach unless directly asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
        *   **Seeking Advice:** Give solutions if they directly ask for your opinion or guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
        *   **Venting About Past Problem:** Simply listen without offering solutions or changing the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
        *   **Emotional Problem (Fear of Failure):** This requires reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   **Provide Hope:** Listen first, then provide hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. The most effective method is to tell stories of others who faced similar or worse situations but still succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. These stories can be real or fabricated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

##### 3. Psychological Trauma
Psychological traumas are varied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. One common trauma among young men is the feeling of inadequacy after rejection by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Rejection makes men feel "not enough" or that something is wrong with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

*   **Exploitation:** Convince him indirectly that the problem lies with the woman or that he is superior to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   **If Single:** Present facts that show the issue was with the woman. For example, mention that she was in a long, failed relationship or that even other successful men were rejected by her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   **If In a Relationship:** Highlight how much better his current partner is than the one who rejected him (e.g., better personality, looks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

This approach makes him feel his value is rising and helps him realize the rejection was meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

##### 4. The Thirst for Sex (for self-protection)
This weak point cannot be exploited by men but is explained to help men protect themselves from manipulation by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

*   **Understanding the Dynamic:** A woman can easily obtain sex, unlike a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. She can use this desire against a man, making him chase her and do anything for her without ever fully giving in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. She might offer a "small taste" when he is about to give up, only to pull it away again, perpetuating the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

Knowing this mechanism can protect men from being [[emotional manipulation strategies|manipulated]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## The "Drug" Effect
When you effectively hit someone's weak points, it's like giving them a drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. As the effect wears off, their brain craves more and associates that positive feeling with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This causes them to subconsciously want to talk to you and meet you again, becoming addicted without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

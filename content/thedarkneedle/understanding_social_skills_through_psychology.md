The traditional approach to [[improving_social_skills_as_a_practice | improving social skills]], often involving techniques like maintaining eye contact or repeating names, is considered superficial and ineffective from a psychological perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Instead, [[impact_of_social_skills_on_relationships | true social efficacy]] stems from deeper aspects of one's personality and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The key to being liked and having positive social interactions is charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## The Three Elements of Charisma

Charisma is comprised of three essential, interconnected elements: presence, warmth, and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For charisma to be effective, these elements must be applied together, as disrupting their balance can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### 1. Presence

Presence in charisma means making others feel strong and valued, rather than overtly displaying one's own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

*   **Active Listening:** When someone is speaking, focus on what they are saying instead of planning your next response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This genuine [[understanding_human_perception_and_its_impact_on_social_relationships | attentiveness]] makes the speaker feel a connection and gives them value, which is highly sought after in human interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Comfort and Spontaneity:** Being comfortable and relaxed in your own skin is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. Your body language and overall demeanor should reflect ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This means being spontaneous and allowing yourself to be natural, without feeling inhibited by others' potential reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. When you are comfortable, others will unconsciously sense it and feel more at ease around you, fostering closer connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### 2. Warmth

Warmth encompasses kindness, gentleness, affection, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. It is not about hypocritically praising others or doing their bidding just to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

*   **Emotional Connection:** Human communication is largely non-verbal; only 7% relies on words, while 93% depends on body language, feelings, and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Your inner feelings and emotions significantly influence how others perceive you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. When you genuinely feel admiration or enthusiasm for someone, it will emanate from you and create a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Assume new people are good and look for their positive qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **The Power of Giving:** Add value to others' lives by offering advice or sharing information, but do so without imposing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Share what you know, but don't insist on follow-up or demand that they act on your suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Acceptance, Understanding, and Honesty:** Be honest about your opinions, even if they differ from others' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Falsely agreeing can lead to being perceived as boring or deceitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While being honest, always accept and understand the other person's perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. Praise should be sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### 3. Power

Power in charisma relates to [[confidence_in_social_interactions | self-confidence]] and a strong personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Avoid Seeking Approval:** Do not talk excessively about yourself or constantly seek validation from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Uphold Principles:** Don't be afraid to confront people or stand by your beliefs and principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If you have a boundary, enforce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. If you want something, don't hesitate to express it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
*   **Strong Body Language:** Your internal mental strength influences your body language, and vice-versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. To project strength, be comfortable and uninhibited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Imagine yourself as the strongest person in the room and act accordingly, sitting comfortably and allowing natural movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

Developing charisma, through understanding and applying these elements, leads to [[importance_social_skills_for_success | success]] in personal and professional life, improving work efficiency and career advancement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

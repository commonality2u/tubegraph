When a girl ignores you, it can be for one of two main reasons: she is testing you, or she perceives you as a guy with [[the_importance_of_avoiding_neediness_in_interactions | limited options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It's more likely to be the latter if she wasn't interested in you from the start and shows no signs of caring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If a girl ignores you because she senses you lack other options, it suggests she feels you are chasing her because she's your only focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Why Appearance of Options Matters
A common reason for a girl to ignore you is her perception that you don't have many other options in your life, leading her to believe you're chasing her because she's the only one you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This doesn't mean you need to actually date multiple people; the strategy is much simpler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

### The Mistake of Lying
A significant mistake in dating is lying about having options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Fabricating stories about imaginary relationships or trying to hint at having many options almost always backfires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This approach leads to two negative outcomes:
1.  **She discovers the lie**: Lying is a huge [[importance_of_not_lying_in_dating | attraction killer]] and makes her feel you are willing to do anything to get her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
2.  **She sees your approval-seeking**: She'll understand you're trying to convey options to seek her approval, which is one of the biggest mistakes in attracting women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Directly lying or merely hinting at options only worsens the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Qualifying Technique
Women don't necessarily care if you *actually* have a lot of options in your life; what matters is how you interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If you treat a girl in a way that suggests you have options, she will assume you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This is achieved through a technique called "qualifying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### What is Qualifying?
Qualifying means screening or filtering potential partners, an action only a person with many options would naturally do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you instantly subcommunicate that you have a lot of options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This technique is powerful for solidifying a girl's attraction, moving her from casual interest to a genuine desire to know more about you and impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The mantra is "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Qualifying makes her feel you are choosing her over other girls, and that she is starting to win you over based on who she is as a person, not just her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. If you don't qualify her, she might perceive you as desperate or only interested in her sexually, assuming you don't have many options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. When you do qualify her, she gets the impression that you are choosy because you have options, and you've chosen her for a specific reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Ways to Qualify a Girl

There are three key ways to qualify a girl and make her feel special and unique:

#### 1. The Qualifying Question
Ask her a question that prompts her to share positive qualities about herself, then acknowledge her for those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Example**: "I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason, I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   **Outcome**: She will actively try to "sell herself" to you by sharing qualities she hopes you'll like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. When you accept her, she'll feel special and understood, not just another random girl you're interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This also opens up new conversational threads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
*   **Important**: Always accept what she tells you. Rejecting her answer will make her feel rejected after putting herself out there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. By accepting her, she'll feel she won you over with her personality, not just her looks, which is crucial for attractive women tired of being valued only for their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This sets you apart as a guy with standards who filters his options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

#### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy
Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've noticed in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If she accepts that your statement is true, she will feel good and start acting more consistently with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Example**: "You know there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>
*   **Outcome**: Ending with a question that invites a "yes" response means that once she agrees ("yeah, I guess I'm pretty open"), she will start to act more consistently with that trait and become more open with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The statement must be genuine and something she feels good about saying yes to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. She'll feel you recognize something valuable and unique about her, fostering a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Tips**: Make the statement open-ended and positive, but vague enough that she can't definitively say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Once you frame her in a certain way, she'll step into that frame and become that person around you, feeling special and lucky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This can lead to her opening up and feeling emotionally close <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Be prepared to open up and be genuine in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   **Qualities to look for**: Open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, [[confidence_and_decisionmaking_in_relationships | confident]], sexually [[confidence_and_decisionmaking_in_relationships | confident]], easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **For attractive women**: A good statement is "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Highly attractive women often wish others would recognize their intelligence more than their beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. People tend to devalue compliments they hear often and desire recognition for traits they secretly wish were noticed more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

#### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself
Often, girls will qualify themselves to you without prompting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. This happens when she's trying to impress you and get you to like her more, such as:
*   Bragging or telling you positive things about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touching you or showing direct interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asking if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you notice a girl qualifying herself, acknowledge her for it and show appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is cool, tell her you like her, or physically accept her (e.g., put your arm around her) to let her know she's winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. If you don't acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. When you acknowledge and accept her, she'll feel great and continue to try to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

This principle of acknowledging appreciation applies beyond romantic interactions. You can qualify [[importance_of_acquaintances_and_social_connections | other people]] in your life, such as friends, by vocalizing what you appreciate about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This makes them feel seen and valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

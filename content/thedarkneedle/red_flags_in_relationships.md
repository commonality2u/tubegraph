The concept of "red flags" in relationships has become widespread, often leading individuals to create exhaustive lists of qualities they dislike or desire in a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. However, rigidly searching for someone who perfectly matches such a list is often futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. The belief that one can find a person with all desired qualities is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. According to one perspective, those who promote strict "red flag" lists often lack a true understanding of how dating works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

While some traditional "red flags" are considered nonsense, such as a woman having male friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> (as a woman who doesn't interact with men would be unable to connect with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>), genuine red flags do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Strategy for Cultivating a Relationship

Instead of focusing on a strict list of qualities, a different approach is suggested:
1.  **Initial Attraction**: If you find a girl's appearance appealing, begin talking to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  **Identify Unchangeable Traits**: If you identify certain *unchangeable* traits that are truly problematic, then you should disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.
3.  **Dating and Influence**: If these fundamental problematic traits are absent, begin dating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. If there are things you don't like (e.g., her clothing style or excessive interaction with other men), the solution is not to leave, but to "change her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

It is believed that a woman should gradually change her personality, thoughts, and behavior to align with your desires as she enters a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This transformation is deemed essential as she falls in love with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Leadership in Relationships
Every relationship has a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. The man should be the leader in a relationship with a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This means you should be in control, and your partner should adopt your preferences, principles, and likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. However, this influence should not be achieved through force, control, or manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Instead, the goal is for her to *want* to please you of her own free will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

The strategy involves three key ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>:
1.  **Tell her what you want**: Share your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   **Timing**: Do not state your opinions immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>; wait until she asks or the topic arises naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
    *   **Stand firm**: If she tries to change your mind or justify her actions, do not justify yourself, try to convince her, or engage in debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Simply state your taste and step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
    *   **Maintain your opinion**: Do not change your opinion, regardless of pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Changing your stance makes you lose your leadership position in her eyes and reduces her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
2.  **Do not force it**: Express your preference in a cold, indifferent manner, not as a major issue or a condition for the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
3.  **Do not show need/attachment**: Do not show that you *need* her to change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If she doesn't change immediately, do not mention it or give it attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This signals that you don't *need* the change, which can prompt her to reconsider <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Over time, as her attachment grows, she will naturally begin to align with your desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## True Red Flags to Avoid

These are traits that a woman cannot change, and being with such a person will lead to suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:

### 1. Flirting with Other Men
If a woman flirts with other men in your presence, she is likely seeking attention or trying to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. These women often wear attention-grabbing clothes and enjoy being stared at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. A relationship with such a person will be filled with drama, as she is unlikely to change this habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Never show jealousy, as that is often her goal and signals her victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 2. Still Attached to Her Ex
If a girl frequently mentions her ex or admits she hasn't gotten over him, you should immediately step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This indicates she is carrying heavy [[emotional_baggage_in_relationships | emotional baggage]] and has not processed her past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. A high-value man should suggest she give her ex another chance, demonstrating a willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. If she chooses to return to her ex, you've avoided a "drama queen" who would consistently bring up past relationships, negatively affecting your current one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### 3. Energy-Sucking Women
This is considered the most dangerous red flag <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. You should not hesitate to walk away from a relationship with a woman who is "full of problems" for your emotional health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. These women, often described as "energy sucking," should be filtered out based on their personality, not their looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

Characteristics of energy-sucking women:
*   **Insecurity and Validation Seeking**: They feel extremely insecure, even if beautiful, and constantly seek validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. They have an endless emotional hunger that cannot be satisfied, no matter how much attention or appreciation they receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   **Using Sex as a Tool**: They may use sex to fulfill these insatiable emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A common example is women in relationships who sleep with other men due to this unfulfilled emotional hunger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. They often have low self-esteem and offer easy sex in exchange for admiration, boosting their self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Drama and Manipulation**: They are often "drama queens" who can turn positive situations into chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. They may resort to manipulation because they feel unworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

It is crucial to pay close attention to a woman's personality and understand her deeply before committing to a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## When a Woman Talks About Other Men

A common question is why women talk about other men when they are supposedly interested in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. There are two main reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>:

1.  **To Show Desire**: She might be trying to convey that she is desired and liked by other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. For example, if she tells you about a guy who approached her and complimented her, she is likely trying to impress you and prompt you to ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Reacting with jealousy in this scenario is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

2.  **To Friend-Zone You / Indication of Past Attachment**: If she discusses a past breakup, how much she loved an ex, or how she's trying to get him back, she is likely trying to "dump her emotions" on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This is a classic sign of being placed in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. It also means she is genuinely interested in the other guy and is carrying heavy [[emotional_baggage_in_relationships | emotional baggage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. In this case, you should walk away and let her deal with her issues independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

The problem of running out of things to say when talking to women is described as simple to solve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The goal is to avoid awkward silences while also steering clear of the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Many men struggle because they act like "human questionnaires," asking dull "get to know you" inquiries that bore women and prevent genuine engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach involves leaping from one question to the next without expanding on topics of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Strategies for Engaging Conversation

### 1. Follow Questions with Statements

Instead of immediately asking another question after a woman answers, follow up her response with a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This approach:
*   Demonstrates active listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
*   Shows a deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.
*   Opens the conversation to more fun or intimate topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.
*   Transforms a Q&A session into an engaging dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

> *Example:*
> **You:** "Do you have any pets?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, I actually have three of the cutest cats in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
> **You:** "Ah, so you're one of those cat people, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
> **Her:** "No, I'm not one of those crazy cat ladies, I just love my cats." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
> **You:** "They say people who like cats tend to be more independent than dog lovers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

This method expands on the topic, injecting fun and banter instead of just ticking off a checklist of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This relates to [[the_formula_for_effective_conversation_with_women]].

### 2. Qualify Her with Playful Disqualification

Once a woman's interest is sparked, begin qualifying her with questions or statements that position you as the "selector" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This involves making a statement that might playfully "disqualify" her as a potential partner, creating a dynamic where she feels compelled to prove herself to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

> *Example (using the cat example):*
> **You:** "Hm, we would never get along. I'm a dog person and I've heard that dog and cat owners tend to have a really intense sexual connection but disagree on every other possible point, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
> **Her:** "Oh really? Well, maybe we could find some common ground." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

This technique steers safe topics into more intriguing territory, subtly challenging her and shifting the conversation from small talk to a playful battle of wits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### 3. Delve into Deeper Levels with Cold Reading

Men often stick to facts, events, and surface-level stories, which are fine for small talk but don't ignite passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Women are more interested in the "mystical" or the emotional meanings behind facts and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. To communicate on this wavelength, use a cold reading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

A cold read is stating something you've observed about her and then making a deeper observation about it to encourage her to open up about her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This relates to [[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication]].

> *Example:*
> **You:** "I can tell just by the way you're talking that you're the kind of girl who goes on a lot of dates but has trouble finding someone you're actually interested in. Then when you find that person you usually lose interest very quickly, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, that's so true." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
> **You:** "I bet you really love adventure. Sometimes it scares you, but deep down you crave something exciting. What's probably happening is that every time you meet these guys you sense that they're not going to satisfy that adventure you crave, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
> **Her:** "Exactly, it's like they don't understand what I'm looking for." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

This allows you to delve into emotional realms, disqualify other men, and present yourself as new and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### 4. Emphasize Passion and Enthusiasm

Many men stick to "interview mode" topics like work and school, which bore both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Women often look for "passionate" men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Enthusiasm breeds enthusiasm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. [[Emphasizing passion and enthusiasm in conversations | Emphasize]] the things you are passionate and enthusiastic about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Even a mundane subject like cooking can become engrossing if discussed with passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Share your excitement about travel, business, music, art, or movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This isn't about bragging, but explaining what truly drives you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Women are attracted to men with drive who know what they want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### 5. Keep the Conversation Playful with Teasing

When men approach beautiful women, they often put them on a pedestal, becoming afraid of offending them, which causes conversations to fizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Women, however, want a guy who is fun to be around and can help them relax and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Teasing helps create a fun environment, allowing a woman to loosen up and open up to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It means being silly and treating her like a playful younger sister, picking on her in a fun, flirtatious way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. You must drop your "cool guy" image and be willing to be a little goofy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This is a key [[techniques_for_making_someone_laugh]].

> *Examples of teasing:*
> *   Getting ready to give a high five, then pulling your hand away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
> *   Imitating her playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
> *   Suggesting she's "coming on to you" (e.g., "Woah, slow down there, at least buy me dinner first") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
> *   Telling an exaggerated lie then picking on her for believing it (e.g., "Wait, you actually thought I have a pet dragon?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.

These playful actions are more fun and effective than discussing mundane topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### 6. Provide Multiple Conversation Threads

Conversations stall because men don't recognize how to smoothly change threads or provide enough new threads for the woman to engage with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Often, a man asks a question and is already thinking about his next remark, missing new conversation topics that could have been transitioned into <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Always try to present her with several different topics she can latch onto when crafting your sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

> *Example:*
> Instead of: "I love baseball." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
> Say: "I love baseball because when I was young my father used to take me to games and now that I'm older I feel a real sense of nostalgia toward it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>

This offers options: baseball, stories about her dad, or things that make her feel nostalgic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Listen for similar openings she gives you.

> *Example of transition:*
> **Her:** "I love to cook. My mom taught me how to cook and now I even find myself watching those cooking shows on TV." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>
> **You:** "Yeah, I'm the same way with those travel shows on TV. I start watching them and get sucked into all the amazing locations. So where would you go on vacation if money wasn't a factor?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>

By improvising off a single word, like "TV," you can easily transition to a completely new topic, akin to a conversational game of jazz <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### 7. Anchor Positive Feelings

Beautiful women crave fun and flirtatious conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Many men fail to communicate well due to nervousness, anxiety, or speaking in a way women don't respond to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Women love to discuss the meaning behind actions and the emotions they evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Emotions arising during a conversation will subconsciously anchor them to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Therefore, anchoring positive feelings to yourself is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

This can be done through teasing (as discussed above) or by asking questions and making statements that prompt her to talk about specific positive feelings she has for something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

> *Example (snowboarding):*
> Instead of focusing on facts like which mountain or equipment, get her to talk about the feelings she experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
> **You:** "Did you do anything fun last weekend?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, I went snowboarding. I had the best time!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>
> **You:** "Wow, I love snowboarding! I think I'm literally addicted to the rush I get going down the mountain. What about you? What excites you most about snowboarding?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
> **Her:** "Well, I guess it would be that feeling of adventure, going so fast, being a little scared but not wanting it to end because it feels like you're living." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>

By focusing on feelings like adventure, excitement, and truly living, you put her in a positive mood, and she subconsciously anchors those positive emotions to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

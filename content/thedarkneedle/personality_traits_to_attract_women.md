This article explores the personality traits that can make any woman feel deeply attached and attracted to a man, emphasizing that attraction for women is primarily emotional, not visual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. If the right emotions are triggered, a woman will be attracted regardless of a man's appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>.

## [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | The Mindset]]

The foundation for attracting women lies in adopting a specific mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Belief in Deserving
A man must believe he deserves anything that exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. It's crucial to avoid thoughts like "I don't deserve that job" or "She's out of my league" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. This belief is a significant sign of strength that draws women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

### Intrinsic Value
Cultivate the belief that you possess intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. Do not allow anyone to diminish or disrespect your worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. If someone disrespects or insults you, you must stop them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. A girl's attraction significantly increases when she sees a man stand up for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>. This principle also applies to women; if a woman disrespects you, boundaries must be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.

### Confidence in Decisions
When making a decision, assume it is the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Exude confidence and avoid hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Whether choosing a path, ordering food, or buying clothes, do so with certainty, without seeking approval or asking for her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Be 100% sure about your choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

### Assumption of Attraction
Always assume that any girl you are attracted to is also attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. This is one of the most important principles in [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | the dating world]] and should be communicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## Behaviors and Actions

Beyond mindset, certain behaviors are key to attracting women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

### Having a Plan and a Goal in Life
Many men mistakenly believe that having a good job or money is the ultimate goal to impress women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>. While money might attract women who value wealth, true attraction comes from being ambitious and actively working towards a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. A man who is still striving, like a medical student working hard, is often more attractive than someone who has already achieved their dream, like an already practicing doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.

Even if you are stable and working, you must always have a goal and be actively pursuing it, whether it's training for a perfect physique or working on a side hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. A woman needs to feel that you are heading somewhere and that she is coming along with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>. Without a personal goal, a woman entering your life can become its sole focus, which is a major mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

**Demonstrating Your Goal:**
To show her your goal is important, make it a priority over her at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. For example:
*   If she suggests meeting up, state you need to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.
*   If you meet, state you need to leave for a gym workout or work on a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:15:00">[06:15:00]</a>.
*   Always stay busy with something meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

This constant striving maintains a wife's attraction and can prevent issues like divorce or infidelity, which often arise when men settle into routine without goals after marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. If a woman tries to mock, challenge, or discourage your goal, it's a test of your strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. Do not let her succeed in this test, but remain calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Ability to Ask for What You Want
This is one of the most [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | attractive traits to women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. When ordering food at a restaurant, choose what you want without asking others for their opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>. If you feel hot in a taxi, ask the driver to open the window <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. Do not underestimate these small actions, as they significantly contribute to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

Even if your request is denied, it's not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. The problem many people face is the fear of asking due to potential embarrassment if refused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. However, the crucial aspect is that you asked for what you wanted without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. This also applies professionally; if you feel underpaid, ask your manager for a raise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>. From now on, wherever you are, and whatever you desire, ask for it without hesitation or overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

### Ability to Handle Failure
The ability to handle failure is ingrained in human nature and is highly sought after by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. Women look for a man who can overcome failure, fall, and then rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. This capability creates an intense, almost unnatural attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

**Demonstrating Resilience:**
*   If you fail a job interview, share it with her but don't show discouragement or loss of hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Immediately apply to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>.
*   If you make a mistake in a relationship, face it, talk to her, and work to resolve the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>. The phenomenon of "makeup sex" exists because women are naturally attracted to men who face challenges and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.
*   The man or woman who fails and then succeeds is often loved most, as women are drawn to the power found in failing and then succeeding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.
*   Never remain stuck in failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Don't give up if you get injured while working out or if you fail an exam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Pick yourself up and rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.
*   Do not be ashamed of showing your failure; it's a part of life and not a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. When a woman sees you can handle failure, her subconscious mind believes you can overcome any challenges in a relationship, leading to increased love and attachment because she feels safe with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

### Not Being in a Rush
In a relationship with a woman, you should never appear hurried or overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>. Do not show that you are trying to sleep with her quickly or rush into a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. Remain calm and take your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Women are attracted to men who are composed, deliberate, and patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Avoid immediately asking to meet the next day after getting her number or meeting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

The duration of conversation is less important than its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. Five minutes of high-energy, exciting interaction are far better than five hours of boring, drawn-out conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. The key is to trigger her emotions and keep the conversation engaging and emotional, not just ordinary talk lacking energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

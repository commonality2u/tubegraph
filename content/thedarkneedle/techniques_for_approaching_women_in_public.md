To successfully [[authentic_approach_to_attracting_women | approach women]], it is crucial to maintain a calm and relaxed demeanor, as nervousness can lead to a perceived lack of confidence and potential rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Overcoming anxiety about approaching women is best achieved by taking action, starting with small, manageable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Preparation and Mindset

### Building Confidence
A simple exercise to boost confidence involves approaching ten women daily and asking for the time, ensuring you are not wearing a watch and your phone is off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This practice helps to build ease over a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It is recommended to perform this exercise a few minutes before you plan to engage in more extensive conversations to boost your comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Environment
For beginners, it's advisable to avoid nightclubs, as they often lead to disappointment due to high competition, defensive attitudes from women who are frequently approached, and loud music that hinders conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Better environments for approaching women include:
*   **Relaxed public spaces** like parks, malls, or coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   **Hobby classes** such as yoga, salsa dancing, or aerobics, which tend to have more women and less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.
*   Other options include restaurants, public libraries, or malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### The Five-Second Rule
Once you have identified a woman you wish to approach, make your move within five seconds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Hesitation can lead to self-doubt, increased nervousness, and ultimately, not approaching at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes When Attracting Women
Many men are rejected during initial approaches because they do not know the right way to approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. [[avoiding_common_mistakes_when_attracting_women | Common mistakes]] include:
*   **Direct, overt approaches**: Such as staring, walking directly up to her, or immediately offering to buy a drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These are often met with excuses like having a boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Women are often programmed to turn down such direct advances and may assume the man is only interested in casual sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
*   **Using witty pickup lines**: These are largely ineffective and often lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The key to a successful approach is making the woman comfortable in your presence before attempting to escalate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. If you try too hard, she may sense a "fishy" intention and raise her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Effective Approach Techniques
### Approach Angle
The angle of your approach significantly impacts the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>:
*   **Never from the front**: If she sees you approaching directly, she will likely put up a wall of resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Never from behind**: Approaching from behind, touching her shoulder, or starting a conversation without warning can scare her and ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Always from the side**: This is the most successful approach as it does not scare her and prevents her from immediately putting up defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Walk past her, tilt your head in her direction, and start the conversation while keeping your chest facing away (talking over your shoulder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This non-threatening posture makes her more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Effective Conversation Techniques with Women
Direct approaches rarely work when [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | starting a conversation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Instead, act in a manner that demonstrates you are not trying to "hit on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

#### Example Openers
1.  **The "Cell Phone Lie" Opener**:
    *   Pretend to be on your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   As you pass the woman, look over your shoulder and pause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
    *   Holding the phone to your ear, say, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
    *   Then, to her, say, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men, is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   After her response, hang up and say, "I am in a hurry, but my friend said never to trust anything a female says half the time she would be lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
    *   Her likely disagreement allows you to continue, "Yeah, I mean it can't apply to all females" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This successfully opens the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   By stating you are in a hurry, you lower her defenses and demonstrate high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

2.  **Environmental Openers**:
    *   Always work according to the environment rather than relying solely on "canned openers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Being natural is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
    *   **Restaurant example**: Ask about what she is eating or drinking, e.g., "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Follow up by saying you're new and looking for recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Neutral environment**: Observe what she's wearing and comment on it, e.g., "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on, what's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This can lead to introductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

3.  **Guessing/Assumption Openers**:
    *   Instead of asking direct questions like "What do you do?" or "Where do you come from?", make a guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Example: "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Her inevitable "no, what makes you say that?" allows you to elaborate, perhaps by commenting on her style or appearance, linking it to a friend, and then adding a playful generalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This invites her to engage and defend her position, successfully opening the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Transitioning the Conversation
Once the conversation is open, the challenge is to move beyond casual talk and spark strong emotional attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Utilize previously learned [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | techniques for qualifying and attracting women]], such as:
*   The [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | qualifying technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
*   The "listen like a therapist" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   Body language awareness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   The push-and-pull technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   Creating mystery (tell her a bit and leave her wanting more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

### Engaging with Groups
When approaching women in groups, a unique strategy is to talk more to the target's friends than to the target herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Most men focus solely on their target, making their interest obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. By engaging the friends, you can make the target feel a bit jealous and curious, causing her to work for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

*   **Example**: Ask the target, "Hey, are they your friends?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. If she confirms, say, "Be a good girl, introduce me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>. Once introduced, begin talking more to one of her friends and momentarily ignore the target. This will often prompt the target to seek your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

## The Role of Physical Touch
[[effectiveness_of_playful_interaction_with_women | Playful physical touch]] is vital for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. It significantly increases the impact of your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Easy routines for touch:
*   **Hands**: Stare at her hands, then gently grab her fingers and comment on her nails, e.g., "Oh, nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Forehead**: Stare at her forehead, say "You have something on your forehead," and then do a slight clean-up with your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Hair**: Stare at her hair, comment on its color or style, and then touch it, e.g., "Wow, nice color or how did you get it curly like that? Is this real hair?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **High Five**: Suggest a high five by saying something like, "You are cool, just like me, we will make a great team, give me a high five," and then give her a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

If a woman allows you to touch her, it indicates she has lowered her defenses and may be open to further physical escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

## Getting Her Number
If you've built sufficient attraction and had a good conversation, getting her number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The "Curiosity Hook" Method
1.  Transition into an interesting story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
2.  During the story, say, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," but then continue with your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
3.  When the story ends, she'll likely ask what you noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
4.  At this point, check the time and say, "Oh, I'm running late, I have to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
5.  Hand her your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   This method leverages her curiosity and ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. You can quickly call to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

### Handling Refusal
*   **Incorrect Number**: If she gives a wrong number, you can playfully say, "Oh, playing, aren't we?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. If she apologizes and offers to re-enter, say, "No, never mind, I don't want it. It was great meeting you," and walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Total Refusal**: If she totally refuses, it means you haven't built enough attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. You can try one more time with a light push ("Come on, giddy up, I don't have much time here") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. If she still refuses, offer a friendly goodbye and walk away immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.

### Providing a Motive
Always provide a motive for her to give you her number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   Example: "My friends are having this party on Saturday, it's one of the coolest events which happens only once a year. I have free passes, you should come." Then hand her your phone, "Here, punch in your number, I'll let you know the timings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

Simply asking "Can I have your phone number?" often leads to rejection or her not remembering you later, as it doesn't create enough attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Exiting
Immediately after getting her phone number, exit the venue to avoid an awkward bump-in later, which could reverse the attraction you've built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

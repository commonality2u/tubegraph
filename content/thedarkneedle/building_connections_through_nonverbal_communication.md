To influence someone's perspective or actions, the process involves two primary steps: first, understanding their inner thoughts, and second, speaking to their awareness by selecting appropriate words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This concept extends to meeting, attracting, or winning over individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

The most direct way to access someone's inner mind is by [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | building a connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. [[creating_positive_emotional_connections_through_dialogue | Making a connection]] means intentionally creating that feeling of an instant bond or "click" with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is generally easier to convince someone with whom you have a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Role of Nonverbal Communication

The human brain constantly and unconsciously processes a vast amount of information about others, with a significant portion being non-verbal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This includes cues like facial expressions, body language, and how a person sits, walks, or moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

### Body-Mood Connection

The principle of [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | making a connection]] is rooted in the idea that your physical body's actions influence your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. You can discern how others are feeling by observing their body and facial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. If you mirror or copy their movements, you may begin to experience similar emotions, demonstrating a direct link between physical posture and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

For instance, consciously walking with your head up and a smile, even if it's not genuine, can alter your mood compared to walking with your head down and a slow pace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This highlights how posture alone can affect emotional states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Understanding and Matching Moods

Copying someone else's posture can help you understand and feel what they are feeling, effectively allowing you to enter their mind <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. To [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | make a connection]] and understand someone's mood, you should adjust your own mood to theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. After observing their posture, define the mood you've noticed (e.g., bored, happy, curious) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Practical Exercise for Mood Matching

To practice [[building_confidence_through_small_interactions | building social skills and connections]]:
1.  **Choose a Subject**: Select a pleasant person with whom you don't have a serious connection, such as a cashier, neighbor, or someone in an elevator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This exercise is for practice before applying it to closer relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
2.  **Read and Mirror**: Observe the chosen person and use your body to mirror their posture and define their mood (e.g., happy, sad, angry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  **Immerse in Mood**: Use inner dialogue to repeatedly think of the word defining the mood, ensuring your thoughts align with the desired mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Recall past memories where you felt that way, remembering images, feelings, and sounds to truly experience the mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
4.  **Approach and Speak**: While maintaining the adopted mood, approach the person and speak normally, keeping the mood consistent until you are both on the same emotional wavelength and the connection is formed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Changing Another Person's Mood

Once a connection is established, you will sense it as "things are going the right way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. At this point, you can subtly begin to change the other person's mood to a desired one by gradually shifting your own gestures, posture, and smile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. As your mood changes, observe theirs shifting along with it, indicating that you have successfully influenced them at a subconscious level using nonverbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

> [!attention] Adapting vs. Imitating
> There is a crucial difference between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. You should subtly adapt to aspects of another person's movements without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Directly copying their gestures, like a mirror, is imitation and can lead to embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Beyond Nonverbal: Verbal Influence

While nonverbal communication is key to [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | creating a perceived deep connection]] and entering someone's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, verbal communication also plays a significant role in influencing thoughts and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. The choice of words and *how* they are spoken can have a psychological effect on the other person's subconscious, increasing the likelihood of agreement, especially after a connection has been made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Techniques for verbal influence include:
*   **Emphasizing the Obvious**: Stating something as obvious to make others believe it (e.g., "we both know it's worth it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Questions That Aren't Questions**: Stating what you want someone to agree with and adding a question tag at the end, ensuring your tone decreases at the end (e.g., "It's easy, isn't it?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Getting Them to Say Yes Repeatedly**: Using phrases like "let's" to issue disguised orders (e.g., "Let's walk a bit more") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Getting multiple "yes" responses trains their mind to comply, saving your main request for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Offering Limited Choices**: Presenting two options, both suitable to you, rather than allowing a refusal (e.g., "cocktail or wine" instead of "do you want a drink?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Anticipating the Future**: Telling people how you expect them to react (e.g., "I know you'll be thrilled about this") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Logical Leaps**: Using "therefore" or "this means that" to connect a true concept with one you want others to agree with, even if the connection isn't inherently logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Order and Order**: Giving two commands, expecting the second, less important one to be followed, which often results in the first, desired command also being followed without question (e.g., "Take out the garbage and come to bed early") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Using "But"**: Emphasizing the part of a statement that comes *after* the word "but" (e.g., "He is always late to work, but he's good at what he's doing") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **The "Ideal" Question**: Asking "What do you ideally want?" or "What would be the ideal result?" to encourage others to describe perfect scenarios, providing you with information to influence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Telling Without Telling**: Expressing your point of view or giving orders by stating that you *won't* do something or *don't* want them to do something, subtly influencing their actions (e.g., "I can't tell you to leave him, the decision must be yours") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **"Yes" Means "No"**: Offering to do something you don't truly want to do with phrases like "I could come if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **"It's Not Important, But It Is"**: Introducing feedback that might be unwelcome with phrases like "I know that you won't consider my advice but..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **A Pleasant Way to Say "Shut Up and Listen"**: Using phrases like "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me..." to convey your perspective and gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

These techniques, when combined with effective nonverbal [[communicating_effectively_to_build_connections | communication]], can significantly improve your ability to [[impact_of_communication_skills_on_building_relationships | build social skills and connections]] and influence others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

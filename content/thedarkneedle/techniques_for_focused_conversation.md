Social skills are considered the most important skill one can possess in life, as they are common among CEOs, company executives, and world leaders alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Communication skills can account for 85% of one's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

At the core of all social skills is a deeply ingrained human instinct: a hunger for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Humans love to feel that they have value in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Satisfying this hunger in the right way can win people over and make them receptive to what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Positive Manipulation
> The speaker recounts an experience with a struggling math student. By telling the student, "you are slow to understand and you're stupid, but you have one great thing: you are hardworking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, the student was motivated to study harder and significantly improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This praise served as "food for the Instinct" of valuing oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## The Golden Rule of Influence

To leave an impression and influence someone, you need to make them feel like *they* are the one who left an impression and influenced you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of showing them how amazing you are, show them that *they* are the amazing and remarkable one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Techniques for Focused Conversation

The key to making someone feel like they left an impression is through focused conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This means making the conversation revolve around them and focusing on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

There are two primary ways to achieve this:

1.  **Let them talk about themselves and build on what they say** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   When someone shares an experience, avoid shifting the focus back to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.
    *   Instead, keep the focus on them by asking follow-up questions like "what did you do about it?" or "how did the date go?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
    *   During their talking, you need to [[effective_listening_techniques | listen to them]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   The goal is to make them the center of the conversation for an extended period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

2.  **Take a general topic and redirect it towards them** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
    *   Even with common or boring topics like the weather, you can shift the focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
    *   Ask questions that make it personal to them, such as "what do you like more, rain or sunshine, summer or winter?" <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
    *   By shifting the conversation's focus to the other person, you give them value and satisfy their instinct for significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This makes them feel they have influenced you, which in turn influences them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Handling Interruptions

If someone interrupts you occasionally, the best approach is to ignore it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Let them talk, and if they change the subject, let them change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Holding on to the previous topic is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. By not trying to prove anything, you display strength, and the other person will sense your power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

However, if someone *constantly* interrupts you, you should not allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Directly and calmly tell them, "Why don't you let me finish what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. As a man, society expects you to express yourself clearly and directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If they continue to interrupt, there is no reason to continue talking to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

## Recognizing Their Presence as a Person

Accepting and valuing people for who they are, not for what they have or do, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Avoid intrusive questions**: Do not ask about their job, degree, salary, or habits like smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The person should feel you care about them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Do not give unsolicited advice or lectures**: Do not start telling people they need to change or giving advice unless they ask for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows them you accept them as they are, problems included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Never place yourself above others**: Do not put yourself in a higher position and start giving advice or dictating what they should do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Do not correct trivial facts**: If someone states a minor inaccuracy that doesn't significantly affect the conversation, do not immediately correct them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Correcting others for inconsequential facts is a bad habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

## Encouraging Admiration

Give the other person the opportunity to try to earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. The moment someone starts trying to gain your admiration, it means you've already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This also applies when a [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | woman]] starts trying to earn a man's admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

*   **Ask for their opinion**: Most people are focused on expressing their own opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Learn to ask for others' opinions and truly listen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Ask for their suggestions**: When people offer suggestions or advice, listen to them and don't reject them or treat them as if they don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
    *   Never treat anyone as if they don't understand anything or as if you're better than them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Even if an idea isn't suitable, respond politely, for example, "That seems like a good idea, but I need to think about it," to avoid outright rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## The Myth of "Being Yourself"

The advice "be yourself" is often described as the "dumbest, worst, and most absurd piece of advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Just as people change habits or work on their physical health, communication is a skill that requires practice and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

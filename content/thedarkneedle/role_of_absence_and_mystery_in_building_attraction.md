Attraction, particularly with women, operates primarily on emotion, with logic serving as a post-hoc justification for decisions made emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This principle, common in sales, applies broadly to human behavior and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Emotion Drives Attraction, Logic Justifies

Women are described as 100% emotional beings who make all decisions based on emotion, later justifying them with logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For example, if a woman says she likes a man because he is "nice, handsome, attractive, tall, or has money," these are merely logical justifications. The true reason for her attraction is that he moved her emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. She is attracted to him because he "stirred her feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

Similarly, reasons given for breakups or divorces, such as a lack of care, understanding, or financial issues, are often logical excuses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. The underlying, real reason is that the attraction died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. If attraction is high, a woman tends to see only the positive aspects of a relationship; when it's low, she focuses on the negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Even in the face of flaws, high attraction can lead to forgiveness and justification based on a partner's good traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### The Role of Emotion Over Logic

To effectively build attraction, one must "attract her emotionally and let her chase the logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This means avoiding attempts to impress with logical attributes like wealth or physique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Tools for emotional attraction include:
*   **Curiosity Phrases**: Statements that spark curiosity and self-awareness, like "You seem like the type who..." or "Have you ever done something you still feel guilty about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   **Fake Psychological Analysis**: Teasing observations about her personality, such as "You seem confident, but I bet you overthink at night," or "You're charming, but I feel like you hide how deeply you feel things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. These stir emotions and draw her in subconsciously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

When she starts trying to justify her attraction to you with logical questions (e.g., about your job or behavior), resist the urge to explain or justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Instead, [[creating_mystery_and_anticipation_in_dating | stay mysterious]], change the subject, or give an unrelated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The logical justification should occur when she is alone, thinking about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## The Power of Absence and Mystery

A crucial truth in attraction is that "women fall in love when you're not around" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The obsession and emotional weight a woman feels for a man occur in his absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### How Absence Fosters Attachment

*   **Mental Repetition**: After a strong emotional experience with you, your absence creates a void. The brain, which craves closure and dislikes unfinished stories, will replay the moments shared, wondering about your thoughts and reasons for not contacting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This mental repetition leads to attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **Imagination at Work**: Her imagination will do more to build attraction than direct interaction ever could <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Memory edits and filters, discarding flaws and embarrassing moments, retaining only positive feelings and impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. She falls in love with an idea of you—a version she constructs in your absence—rather than the actual you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   [[the_role_of_uncertainty_in_attraction | Feelings]] are built in silence, distance, and [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | mystery]], not through constant presence or texting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. If you are always present, she might enjoy you, but if you vanish when she desires more, she will fall in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

To leverage this, after a date, avoid excessive texting unless she initiates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. If she starts calling frequently, give excuses to be busy, as her subconscious will try to eliminate the emotional state created by your absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. Remember, a woman gets attached when you are not with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## The Power of Her Explaining Herself

A woman becomes more attached the more she explains herself to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. When she explains, she invests effort, and her brain registers you as more important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. People don't spend time justifying or clarifying themselves to someone they don't care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. Her need to be understood becomes a tool for building a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

To encourage her to explain herself:
1.  **Hold a Frame**: Stay calm and do not rush to fix slight tensions or misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Your silence can force her to clarify and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For example, if she says "I'm not like other girls," a smirk and "That's what they all say" will prompt her to explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
2.  **Misinterpret Playfully**: Slightly twist her words in a fun, challenging way that makes her defend her identity, without insulting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. For instance, if she says "I don't date that often," respond with "So you're secretly a heartbreaker who got bored of the game?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> This prompts her to justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
3.  **Label Her Behavior with a Teasing Judgment**: Use confident, tongue-in-cheek accusations that stick in her head and compel her to correct the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Examples include "You look like trouble" or "You're the type that breaks hearts just for fun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
4.  **Challenge Her Uniqueness**: When she reveals something personal or emotional, act interested but imply it's not rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, if she meditates, say "That's cool. Most girls go through that phase eventually" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. This encourages her to explain why she is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.
5.  **Reward Only**: Reward her for emotionally opening up, justifying herself, or seeking your approval, not for superficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. For example, after she defends her choices, say "Okay, I'll give you that one. You actually surprised me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This makes your validation feel earned and addictive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

When she feels misunderstood, then understood, she desires more of that validation. This process makes her work for emotional validation, and her brain justifies the effort by concluding you are important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Once she defines herself based on your perception of her, she doesn't just want your attention, she needs it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

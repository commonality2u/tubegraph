To make a woman feel deeply attracted and attached, a key ingredient is "drama," which refers to stirring her emotions in a specific way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. This emotional stirring involves several feelings that, when experienced with you, can lead to the release of love hormones and foster attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. One crucial aspect of this "drama" is the **importance of mystery**.

Women are attracted to the source of the emotions they feel, meaning you need to be the origin of these feelings in your conversations and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>.

## Key Elements of Mystery in Relationships

### 1. Excitement through Mixed Signals
[[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | Excitement]] can be generated by blending attention with a touch of indifference in your conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This involves complimenting her at times and critiquing her at others, in a way that stirs her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. The pattern should be one line showing interest and another showing a bit of disinterest, avoiding complete disinterest or over-attentiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

*   **Example of mixed signals:** "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. This shows interest without appearing to chase her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
*   **Impact of sequencing:** The last thing said often has the most impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. For instance, saying "You're so short, but still you're adorable" creates a rise and fall in her emotions, which generates excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

The only time to show complete attention is when she does something you like that you previously mentioned, such as wearing a favorite color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

### 2. Being Enjoyable and Spontaneous
To be seen as enjoyable, you must first enjoy your own time, being positive, relaxed, and present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. Spontaneity is crucial; say and act as you wish without overthinking your words or movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>.

*   **Talk about what you love:** Women's emotions often mirror yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. Sharing your passion for topics you love, like travel or business, will transfer your enthusiasm to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **Turn negativity into positivity:** Point out a minor flaw and immediately reframe it positively. For example, "Do you always wear this much makeup...? Don't worry, you still look cute with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This technique often makes her laugh and enjoy the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

### 3. Leaving Her Wanting More

#### Unfinished Conversation
Spark intense interest in something you say or do, then pull back at the peak of excitement, [[leaving_women_wanting_more_through_mystery_and_intrigue | leaving her eager for more]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

*   **Examples:**
    *   "Oh, I completely forgot I was supposed to tell you something really important! Wait, I have to make an important phone call. I'll tell you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
    *   "I've noticed something fascinating and strange about you... I'll tell you later, now's not the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.
    *   Start an incomplete story, like mentioning two habits you hate in women and only revealing the first, promising to tell the second "when you're ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Effect:** This delay increases her excitement, curiosity, and desire, making her think about you and creating a strong sense of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>.

#### Not Revealing Feelings Too Early
[[importance_of_mystery_in_dating | Maintaining attraction and mystery in relationships]] requires not revealing your true feelings too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Ending a date while it's still enjoyable, rather than letting it become dull, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid promising another meeting:** A great way to [[importance_of_mystery_in_dating | maintain mystery]] is to leave a date without mentioning another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.
    *   She will be unsure if you enjoyed your time, causing her to think about you frequently and wonder why you didn't ask for another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.
    *   This uncertainty will make her "go crazy" trying to figure out your interest level, making it hard for her to stop thinking about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.
    *   A state of confusion maintains her curiosity about your intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

*   **The "killed mystery" phenomenon:** Telling a girl you love her or are in love with her too early will cause her to lose all attraction, as it kills the element of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. This [[creating_attraction_through_uncertainty | uncertainty]] is a primary factor in attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>. Therefore, never tell her how you truly feel; let her stay in a state of [[importance_of_mystery_in_dating | mystery]] and keep her guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Exception:** If she confesses her love for you, it is acceptable to show that you want her, but she should still want you more than you want her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

### 4. Prioritizing Principles and Valuing Yourself
A high-value man prioritizes his principles and shows a willingness to walk away if they are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This demonstrates [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | confidence]] and options, making her see you as a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

### 5. Keeping Her Guessing with Information
Make her eager to learn more about you by keeping her in a constant state of guessing through mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. This means not giving away too much information about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

*   **Avoid over-sharing:** Providing detailed answers to every question can signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
*   **Play a guessing game:** When asked personal questions (e.g., "Where do you work?"), respond with playful mystery, like "Guess, and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain some degree of mystery:** Gradually decrease the level of mystery over time, but always keep some <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>. Do not immediately disclose all details of your activities; keep her wondering what you are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

### 6. Healthy Jealousy (When Appropriate)
If not in a serious relationship, admit to dating other women if asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. This can make her jealous and motivate her to work harder to keep you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. In an exclusive relationship, occasionally talking to other women or having female friends can also induce a sense of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:00">[12:22:00]</a>. However, it's vital to reassure her that she is the one who truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. This creates a sense of competition, making her see you as a prize and deepening her attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.

### 7. Authenticity as a Foundation for Safety
A woman will not enter a physical relationship unless she feels comfortable and safe with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>. The most essential tip for creating safety is ensuring your presentation aligns with your true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. Being honest with your personality, even before approaching women, makes her sense you are trustworthy and genuine, not fake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

### 8. Embracing Disagreement
Do not be afraid to engage in debates or disagreements from time to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>. Always agreeing with her signals a lack of self-respect and fear of losing her, indicating a lack of [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. Women seek a challenge, and you won't be one if you always agree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>. [[importance_of_nonreactivity_in_relationships | Nonreactivity]] to potential negative consequences of disagreement shows strength.

## The Recipe for Lasting Attraction
A good mix of all these emotions is the perfect recipe to make any girl attracted to you for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. Avoid letting any single emotion dominate, as this can lead to boredom and a loss of attraction over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:00">[15:42:00]</a>. To evoke these emotions, you need to be [[overcoming_predictability_in_relationships | unpredictable]] in everything you do, keeping the girl guessing about your next move and always [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintaining a slight sense of mystery]] and unpredictability in your conversations, behavior, and expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.

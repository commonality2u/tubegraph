## Understanding Obsession vs. Liking

While previous social skills teachings may cover how to make someone like you, making someone obsessed and addicted to you, eagerly awaiting the next opportunity to talk, requires a specific skill: "triggering weak points" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Identifying Weak Points

Every human possesses four weak points, and in 99% of people, at least one of these is significantly stronger than the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. The key is to identify and use this dominant weak point to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Detecting Weak Points in Conversation

Human behavior can be visualized as a line that sometimes rises and falls. A "spike" occurs when you hit a sensitive nerve, causing a significant increase in emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

Signs of a "spike" include:
*   **Change in behavior**: A slight or significant increase in emotional response, often triggered by making them laugh or bringing up an engaging topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Repetition**: Saying a phrase or sentence twice, especially if they didn't get the desired reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

When a spike or repetition occurs, observe if it's directly related to them personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This indicates a "gap in their defenses," an internal deficiency they subconsciously want filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## The Four Weak Points

### 1. Thirst for Validation

Some individuals have an excessive need for validation, even beyond a normal desire for appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

*   **Detection**: They constantly try to prove their specialness, seek admiration, frequently talk about achievements, retell impressive stories, or brag about attracting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. They generally like to feel in control of their social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Exploitation (Indirect Praise)**: Give them a sense of control from time to time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The bait is praise, but it must be given indirectly and intelligently to affect their subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Direct compliments are ineffective and make you seem like you're "sucking up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.
    *   **Method 1: Seeking Advice/Assistance**: Ask for their advice on a problem (even a made-up one). When they offer a solution, respond with "Wow, you're absolutely right! I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This makes them feel intellectually superior and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   **Method 2: Attributing Praise to Others**: If they mention an achievement (e.g., running 6 miles), stay silent and don't react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. They will likely ask why you asked. Then, say, "The other day Henry and I were talking about you and we were debating whether you could run 6 miles without stopping. He told me 6 miles is a really big number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This makes them feel validated, appreciated, and makes them think about the conversation for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   **Method 3: Joking about a Source of Pride**: Joke about something they are proud of, like their height ("How's the weather up there?") or success with others ("Dude, how did you even pull that off?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This reinforces their pride while being playful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### 2. Fear of Failure

Individuals with significant life-changing goals (e.g., competitive university, difficult job) often harbor an internal fear of failure, despite external encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. This fear creates an internal void <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

*   **Detection**: They share their ambitious dreams, but an underlying voice of doubt remains, even if not explicitly stated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.
*   **Exploitation (Emotional Reassurance)**: If you fill this void, you can become like a drug they depend on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Your goal is to make them express their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Most people offer solutions or advice, which is the wrong approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
    *   **Key Principle**: Listen first, then provide hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   **How to provide hope**: Tell stories of others who were in similar or worse situations but still succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. For example, if someone fears failing at web development, you could say, "My cousin was in the same position as you, and now he's an engineer at Microsoft... he wasn't even working as hard as you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. These stories can be real or made up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

> [!INFO] Types of Responses to Problems
> When someone talks about a problem, there are three scenarios, each requiring a different approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>:
> 1.  **Seeking Advice**: They directly ask for your opinion or guidance. Your response should be to help them find a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
> 2.  **Venting about a Past Problem**: They tell you about a bad experience or an insoluble problem. Simply listen; do not offer solutions, act uninterested, or change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
> 3.  **Emotional Problem**: The problem is not just logical but emotional (e.g., stress about the future, fear of failure). This is where emotional reassurance is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### 3. Psychological Trauma (specifically Rejection)

One common psychological trauma among young men is the feeling of "not being enough" after rejection by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This happens even if the rejection reasons were unrelated to their attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

*   **Detection**: A man dwelling on being rejected, feeling there's something wrong with his appearance, personality, or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.
*   **Exploitation (Indirect Reassurance of Value)**: Convince him that either the problem was with the woman, or he is far better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Do not do this directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>; make him come to this conclusion himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **If he is single**: Present facts that highlight issues with the woman, making it clear the problem is with her, not him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. For example, "That girl was in a relationship for 6 years, her boyfriend promised to marry her but then married someone else and now she's depressed and taking anti-depressants" or "Even Bob tried talking to her and she rejected him too" (Bob being known for success with women) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   **If he is in a relationship**: Compare his current partner favorably to the woman who rejected him, saying, "The girl you're with now is so much better than the one who rejected you; she has a better personality, she looks better, and so on" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   This approach makes him feel his value is rising and helps him realize the rejection was meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### 4. Thirst for Sex (for Protection)

This weak point is explained for protection rather than exploitation by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

*   **Mechanism**: A woman does not experience this thirst the way a man does, as it's readily available to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. A woman can use this against a man to [[psychological_manipulation_in_relationships | manipulate]] him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. She can keep a man chasing, giving only a "small taste" when he's about to give up, then pulling it away again to continue the pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Understanding this can protect men from [[psychological_manipulation_in_relationships | manipulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.

## The Addiction Mechanism

When you consistently address someone's weak points, it's akin to giving them a drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
Like any drug, its effect wears off, causing their brain to crave more. Their brain then associates you with that "drug" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Unconsciously, they will start wanting to talk to you and meet you again, becoming addicted without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

Understanding the psychology of attraction involves recognizing various factors, including how physical appearance plays a role in the dynamics of relationships. One particular technique highlights how mentioning differing physical traits can influence a woman's perception and engagement.

## Strategic Mention of Contrasting Looks

To make a woman think about you constantly and strengthen her attraction, consider subtly mentioning individuals who possess contrasting physical characteristics to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:55">[01:37:55]</a>. For instance, if the woman you're interested in has black hair, you could casually bring up a blonde girl in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:99">[01:40:99]</a>. This could involve recounting an experience with a "blonde girl who used to impress me" at a former workplace, or simply mentioning a famous blonde actress whose work you admire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:30">[01:45:30]</a>.

The key is to speak naturally, without making it seem as though you are sending a hint or signal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>. This approach leverages a common trait in women: their tendency to [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | overthink]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:66">[02:07:66]</a>. This overthinking is noted as one of their significant "weaknesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:39">[02:31:39]</a>.

When you mention someone with a distinctly different appearance, even a brief comment can lead her to ponder its implications later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:88">[02:37:88]</a>. She might question, "Does he like blondes? Am I not attractive to him? Am I not beautiful? Maybe I should dye my hair blonde" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:88">[02:41:88]</a>. This sustained thought process about you, and her attempts to understand your preferences, is described as the "quickest way to her heart" and the "fastest route to love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>.

## Thoughtful Criticism of Appearance

As a man, it's common to fear hurting a woman's feelings or seeming impolite by offering criticism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:59">[03:09:59]</a>. However, this is described as a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:23:25">[03:23:25]</a>. When you criticize her appearance, such as telling her an "outfit doesn't suit you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:69">[03:39:69]</a> or that a "picture didn't turn out well" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:03">[03:44:03]</a>, she may actually admire your confidence and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.

This honest criticism has a "strong impact on the relationship" because it makes your subsequent compliments more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>. If you consistently compliment her, your praise might lose its significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:81">[04:00:81]</a>. However, when you occasionally offer criticism, your compliments become "special" and more desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:05">[04:06:05]</a>. This is based on a "universal human trait" where people tend to value rare things more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:90">[04:24:90]</a>. Therefore, don't be afraid to criticize, as it establishes a foundation that enhances the value of your future praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:97">[04:36:97]</a>.

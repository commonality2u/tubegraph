To deeply engage a woman's interest, the fastest method is to make her think about you continuously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The goal is for her to think about you 24 hours a day, unable to get you out of her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This can be achieved by understanding two key psychological doors to her mind: Uncertainty and Expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Two Keys to a Woman's Mind

### Key 1: Uncertainty

Uncertainty is crucial because women are perceptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For a woman to develop feelings and start liking you, she needs time, much of which should be spent apart from you, thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Scientifically, [[understanding_female_attraction | women are attracted to men]] whose emotions are somewhat mysterious, creating uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This uncertainty leads to thinking, and thinking, in turn, leads to love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

When a woman interacts with you, her primary subconscious goal is to find certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. She seeks answers to three main questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>:
*   Do you really want her? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
*   How interested are you in her? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>
*   Who likes the other more (does she like you more, or vice versa)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

If you don't provide her with these answers, she becomes yours in a sense, as she'll keep playing games to find them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

#### How to Maintain Uncertainty

To avoid giving her certainty, practice the following:

*   **Don't Compliment Her**: If a woman is attractive, her ego is likely very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. She will assume you are interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. While her knowing you're interested isn't a problem, she shouldn't know *whether* you actually want her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Avoid compliments, especially in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Just talk normally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Don't Ask for a Date**: After a good time together, avoid saying things like, "We should go out again" or "I had a great time; we should do this again sometime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Such statements give her certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, ending her intrigue and preventing her from thinking about you much afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. If you say nothing, she'll wonder if you enjoyed it or want to see her again, prompting her to analyze the meeting and reflect on her impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. This thought process is crucial for sparking interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Don't Ask Her for Anything**: Avoid requesting anything that shows you need her or her affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This includes asking for social media, hugs, kisses, or calling you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Don't send messages like "Why don't you reply to me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Live your life and make her feel like a minor character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. By not asking for anything, you stand out from other guys who constantly seek her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, leading her to question you and think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
    *   *Note*: Avoid being overly cold or completely indifferent, as this gives her a clear "no" and the certainty she seeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
*   **Don't Always Be Available**: Avoid immediately responding to messages or being available every time she reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. If you went out today, wait a week before suggesting another outing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. A common misconception is that she'll forget you if you don't talk often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. [[understanding_female_psychology_and_hormonal_influences | Attraction builds when you're not around]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, giving her space to think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   *Golden Rule*: "A girl will forget you if you're afraid she'll forget you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This means she'll forget everyone except the person who isn't afraid of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

Finally, trust in this process and resist the inner urge to give her certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. These feelings will arise, but practicing self-control will benefit you in all areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Key 2: Expectations

The second door to a woman's mind is expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Always be the opposite of her expectations and never let her predict your actions or understand you completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

When you give a girl uncertainty, she'll think about you and try to predict your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Whatever she expects you to do, do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This keeps her thinking about you in an endless loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

#### How to Break Expectations

The human mind is simple; it expects you to repeat what you did before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. To counter this:
*   If you call her every day, she'll expect it; sometimes skip a day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   If you went out three times this week, next week go out only once or not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   If you message her every day, stop for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   If you always laugh with her, sometimes meet her without laughing at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

Keep her guessing, feeling puzzled, and unable to figure you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Avoid mirroring her response times in texting (e.g., if she replies in 3 hours, you reply in 3 hours) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This hands control over to her, and women aren't naive; they will see through such games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Instead, be unpredictable: sometimes respond right away, sometimes take your time, and other times don't reply at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This makes you appear less interested while also making it impossible for her to predict your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

Impudence is a way of speaking that, when used effectively, can make a girl pursue you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is defined as a lack of modesty or [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] with a slight disregard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Why Impudence is Attractive
In a woman's eyes, an impudent man is perceived as capable of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Attraction is instinctive and not based on logic or modern-day principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. The primary trait a woman seeks in a man is his ability to survive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. This means a man who is "selfish, strong, and harsh" is seen as having a greater chance of survival, and women are drawn to him for this reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Conversely, "nice guys" are often chosen only when the bolder option is unavailable, and they are prone to being used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

Women are genetically predisposed to seek the impudent man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Even in current times, where survival isn't a daily necessity, these instincts persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Impudence and [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] are traits that foster deep love and attachment in women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Displaying this type of boldness and impudence can lead to obsessive attachment from a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The key is to show this through your speech, especially early in interactions, but always with moderation and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Elements of Impudence
Impudence in conversation involves four key elements:

### 1. Be a Little Cheeky
Being cheeky means adopting a mischievous manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The goal is to make her wonder, "Did he really just say that?" or "Did he really just do that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This approach breaks the "boredom trance" that many people experience in formal interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. By being a little impudent, you interrupt her usual pattern and make her pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

Being mischievous involves acting as if you don't know your place and showing too much familiarity too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Many men make the mistake of being overly careful and formal, which makes them seem like strangers, preventing any physical or emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

#### Avoiding Neutrality
Neutrality is weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. If you disagree with someone, especially a girl, state it directly and maintain your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Influential people are often extreme in their opinions, not neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. You shouldn't constantly seek everyone's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

#### Offering Unsolicited Advice
One effective method to be cheeky and avoid neutrality is to offer unsolicited advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. For example, telling a blonde-haired girl, "You'd look really beautiful with black hair," shows excessive familiarity and grabs her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This unexpected comment creates an emotional response because women rarely encounter such surprises in conversations with new acquaintances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. It's edgy without being rude, making her question your intentions and think about what you said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### 2. Be Bold
[[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Boldness]] is widely attractive to all humans, not just women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. A bold move involves taking a risk, whether real or a potential for embarrassment, without overthinking the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key is to live fully in the present and focus energy on the action itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

When interacting with girls, you must be bold and take the first step in everything, from initiating conversation and flirting to making physical moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Bold actions, even simple ones, have a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. People are drawn to bold individuals because they are unpredictable and break repetitive patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Shy individuals, who avoid any risk, are often found boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

#### Demonstrating Boldness
To demonstrate boldness to a girl:
*   If she's talking too much or raising her voice, you can look at her and say, "Shut your trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is a phrase you would typically only say to a close friend or girlfriend, not a stranger, making it shocking and impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   If you catch her looking at you, a bold statement like, "I just totally caught you staring at me," can surprise her and pull her out of her routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It demonstrates a lack of [[how_agreeing_too_much_can_negatively_impact_attraction | walking on eggshells]] and signals [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | boldness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The sooner you are bold in a conversation, the more you can set an emotionally charged, attractive tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### 3. Be Shameless
[[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | Shamelessness]] involves having the courage to say things as they are, expressing what you're thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. It's about saying what isn't usually said, similar to a child who speaks their observations aloud without inhibition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. You articulate what everyone else is thinking but is too hesitant to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

However, attractive shamelessness is different from "dumb shamelessness" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. It means saying what you think as long as it doesn't hurt anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. For example, calling someone "fat" or "cripple" is harmful and constitutes stupidity, not attractive shamelessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

#### Demonstrating Shamelessness Smartly
*   **Reflect on past comments**: Refer back to something she said earlier and frankly state your feeling about it. For example, if she said something aggressive, you could say, "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Ask personal but non-offensive questions**: If she mentions "girls' night," you could ask, "Does that mean you don't shave your legs?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This is personal but can escalate the conversation to a deeper, even sexual, level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Point out obvious observations**: If there's an "elephant in the room," bring attention to it instead of ignoring it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. For instance, if a short girl is walking beside you, you can openly acknowledge her height: "I didn't see you. I didn't notice at first that you're short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Connect the dots**: If she's telling a story and leaves out details, fill in the blanks. For example, if a dating app experience didn't work out, you might interject, "Ah, so the sex got boring or no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. This shows [[traits_attractive_to_women_boldness_ shamelessness_and_slight_disrespect | shamelessness]] without being hurtful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

The most important advice for shamelessness is to always point out the "elephant in the room," especially in a mixed group, by saying what everyone else is thinking but is too shy to voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### 4. Be Slightly Disrespectful
To fully master impudence, you must be slightly disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This does not mean insulting her or treating her poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Instead, it means giving her the same level of respect you would give your best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, even if you've just met her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

Many men are overly polite and treat girls like an elementary school principal, walking on eggshells around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. This excessive respect prevents any emotional reaction and makes it impossible to spark attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. If you over-respect a woman, she may perceive herself as superior to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. While extreme disrespect should be avoided, the best approach is treating her like a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

#### How to be Slightly Disrespectful
*   **Don't respond directly to questions**: Many guys feel compelled to answer every question a girl asks with a long, thoughtful reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Instead, intentionally divert the conversation. For example, if she asks, "So, where did you grow up?", you might respond with, "Oh, so last night I was out..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. You can always return to her question later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Control the conversation**: By not immediately answering, you show that she isn't controlling the flow of the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. This non-linear approach makes the conversation more interesting and creates a space for surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Trigger attraction**: Leaving a gap by not answering immediately creates [[the_role_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | unpredictability]] and an emotional reaction, triggering attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. It also makes her feel like she has to "win you over" because you're not easily submissive just because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

By applying these elements of impudence—being a little cheeky, bold, shameless, and slightly disrespectful—you can make a girl start chasing you and valuing you more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. This is because you project the image of a strong man who is fearless and doesn't give excessive attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.

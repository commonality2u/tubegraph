The journey to developing social skills can often feel misleading, as conventional advice may not yield desired results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The true solution lies not in superficial actions like maintaining eye contact or repeating names, but in transforming one's personality and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Possessing charisma and being well-liked is achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Charisma is comprised of three fundamental elements: Presence, Warmth, and Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. It's crucial to apply these elements together, as a disruption in their [[balancing_power_with_charisma | balance]] can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Elements of Charisma

### 1. Presence
Presence involves making others feel strong rather than overtly displaying one's own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

*   **Being a Good Listener:** When someone is speaking, focus on what they are saying instead of planning your response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This genuine listening gives the speaker value, which is highly sought after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. It fosters a connection, leading people to naturally gravitate towards talking to you more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

*   **Being Comfortable and Spontaneous:** Your body language and overall demeanor should convey relaxation and ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This comfort is instinctively sensed by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Being spontaneous means allowing yourself to react naturally, like sneezing without shyness, as long as you are not harming anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Acting comfortably, as you would with close family, makes others feel closer to you and encourages them to relax in your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.

### 2. Warmth
Warmth encompasses kindness, gentleness, affection, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. True warmth avoids hypocrisy, where kindness is merely a tactic to be liked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

*   **Emotional Communication:** Words account for only 7% of communication, while 93% relies on body language, feelings, and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Your internal feelings, even if unspoken, are sensed by others and greatly influence whether they want to be around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   **Assuming Good Intentions:** When meeting someone new or talking to a friend, assume they are a good person and look for their good qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Feeling admiration and enthusiasm for the conversation internally will project outward and touch the other person's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Shared feelings lead to mutual comfort and desire for connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

*   **The Power of Giving:** Add value to others' lives by offering advice or information without imposing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For example, if a friend mentions needing to rent a house, share relevant information like a website you know, but do not aggressively follow up or demand they use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Sharing knowledge is a beautiful act when done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

*   **Acceptance, Understanding, and Honesty:** Be honest about your preferences and opinions, even if they differ from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Feigning agreement makes you seem boring and untrustworthy in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While disagreeing, maintain acceptance and understanding of the other person's views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Praise, when given, must be sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. If you have a close relationship, you can offer honest, brief feedback on something you didn't like, but again, without insistence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. True kindness involves honesty, sharing value, acceptance, understanding, and empathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### 3. Power
Presence and warmth alone are insufficient for charisma; power is also essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This inner strength requires [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | self confidence]] and a strong personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

*   **Autonomy and Self-Worth:** Avoid talking excessively about yourself or seeking others' approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

*   **Confrontation and Boundaries:** Do not be afraid to stand firm on your principles and beliefs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. If someone attempts to cross your "red lines" or pressure you to do something against your values, assertively say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Similarly, express your needs and desires without fear; for example, address issues in a restaurant directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

*   **Strong Body Language:** Your internal mental strength will naturally manifest in your body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. If you struggle with inner strength, consciously adopting comfortable and free body language can psychologically affect you, making you feel stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Imagine yourself as the strongest person in the room and act accordingly, by taking your space and sitting comfortably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Conclusion
Charisma extends beyond just being liked; it can significantly enhance work efficiency, career advancement, and overall life success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

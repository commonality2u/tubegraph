To become the most attractive man to women, emulate the traits of an older man while being young <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Women are naturally drawn to older men, not for logical reasons like money, but due to an inherent attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. If a young man possesses these traits, he can evoke the same emotions a woman feels with an older man, making him even more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Cultivating Passion and Purpose

One key trait of older men is an obsession with something specificâ€”a passion or a clearly defined hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This isn't just about having *any* passion; it's about the *type* of passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### The Nature of True Passion

Unlike a young man's goal-oriented pursuits (e.g., creating a YouTube channel for fame or money), a true passion is enjoyed purely for its own sake, without caring about the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This type of passion significantly multiplies your attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

True passion involves [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | creativity and production]], not just consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Consumption hobbies (not attractive):** Playing video games, watching movies, eating, watching anime, or football are generally considered consumption-based activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. While enjoyable, they are not typically seen as attractive hobbies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   **Production/Creativity hobbies (attractive):** These are activities that require effort and hard work but bring deep enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Programming and creating games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>
    *   Taking care of a garden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>
    *   Cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
    *   Building a strong physique at the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>
    *   Hiking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>
    *   Martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>
    *   Painting, pottery, or metalworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

If you don't currently have such a hobby, consider exploring activities that require effort yet are enjoyable, as they can unlock a new sense of fulfillment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

## Showcasing Your Passion to Women

Simply stating "I love hiking" will not evoke attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. To make your passion attractive, you need to display it effectively:

### 1. Prioritize Your Hobby

Show that your passion holds significant importance in your life by prioritizing it, even over time with a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   Decline or reschedule dates if they conflict with your hobby time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   If you have a regular training schedule, communicate that you cannot meet during those times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Even if a woman tries to persuade you to stay, force yourself to attend to your hobby; do not give in to her pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This is a technique to make her like you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### 2. Talk About Your Passion with Deep Emotion

When discussing your hobby, don't treat it as an ordinary activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Express the profound emotions it evokes within you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   Describe the feeling of accomplishment when you lift heavier weights at the gym or the love for the pain in your muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   Share the satisfaction of reaching the top of a mountain after a long, exhausting hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
*   Use strong emotional expression rather than simple statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

By combining these two methods, you effectively display this attractive trait of an "older guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Confidence in Decisions

Another characteristic of older men is their complete [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | confidence]] in decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. They have firm convictions and beliefs that are difficult to sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Sticking to Your Convictions

When making difficult decisions, even if your partner disagrees or pleads with you, you must hold your ground if you are fully convinced your decision is the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

> For example, the speaker recounted a time when his girlfriend wanted to move to a slightly better, more expensive apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. Despite her appeals about more space and comfort, he stood his ground, prioritizing financial stability and long-term goals over a temporary upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. She later admitted she respected him more for thinking long-term and prioritizing what truly mattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Saying "no" to a woman and standing your ground, even on seemingly small matters, can paradoxically make you more attractive to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Avoiding the "Child" Role in Relationships

A crucial trait of the older man is that he is never treated as a "child" by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. In a relationship, you either take on a fatherly role or she treats you like a little child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. It is paramount that you never allow a woman to treat you like a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The speaker mentions that the concept of giving a woman the feeling you play a fatherly role is a significant topic that warrants its own dedicated discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

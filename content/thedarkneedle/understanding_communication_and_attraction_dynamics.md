[[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | Understanding the dynamics of attraction]] and [[effective_communication_in_dating | effective communication]] is crucial for building connections, particularly with women. A common mistake many individuals make is making the other person, specifically a woman, the central focus of their interaction, treating them as the "main character" of the exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This approach often leads to being ignored or ending up in the [[friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

Instead, a more effective mindset is to adopt the belief, "I am the main character; she's just a side quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.

## Societal Conditioning and the "Main Character" Mindset

Society often trains individuals from a young age to perceive a woman as the ultimate goal or reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a>. This conditioning is evident in media, where heroes are often rewarded with a woman after achieving success, or in social media, where influencers showcase women as a sign of their successful lifestyle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This embeds the idea that women are a reward for hard work (e.g., "make money so you can have a woman" or "train and build your body to get a woman") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This mindset places women on a high pedestal, preventing one from seeing them as merely a side quest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

To achieve [[understanding_male_and_female_attraction | true attraction]], it's important to view oneself as the main character, with the woman serving as a side character whose role is to add enjoyment to one's story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. It's also crucial to understand women's thinking rather than just memorizing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

## Principles for Building Attraction

### 1. Control the Conversation Topic

A key rule to remember is that when two people are talking, the one with more perceived value is the one who chooses the topic of conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. A common mistake is trying to find out a girl's interests and then talking about those things to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This approach typically leads to the [[friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

Instead, one should talk about something they genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. While this doesn't mean talking *about yourself*, if the discussion is about a topic, it should be one that interests you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. For example, if a girl mentions a history book and you don't like history, don't force a conversation about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. Instead, you can ask questions like, "You don't seem like the type who reads books" or "I didn't think you liked history. What do you like about it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

When communicating, focus on speaking about emotions, not just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. For instance, a girl at the gym is more likely to connect with someone who asks *why* she works out and enjoys it (emotions) rather than someone who discusses nutrition and exercise science (facts) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. The core principle is never to talk about something you don't genuinely care about just to impress or gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

### 2. Don't Need to Prove Anything

When interacting, always remind yourself that you don't need to prove anything to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. This conveys that she is not the most important thing in your life and not the main character in your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>.

*   **Accept Accusations:** If she claims you're lying or stupid, simply agree and laugh, e.g., "Yes, I'm a liar" or "Yeah, I'm stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This demonstrates you see her as merely an "NPC" (non-player character) in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.
*   **Handle Interruptions:** If she interrupts you, don't try to finish your sentence or tell her to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. Just let her talk and don't return to the interrupted topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. This subtly communicates that her opinion isn't paramount to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

This approach gives her the feeling you don't need her validation, which can make her more [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | attached to you]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. Always maintain the mindset, "Whether people listen to me or not, I'll still be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>.

### 3. Complete Honesty

[[importance_of_decisiveness_and_logic_in_building_attraction | Complete honesty]] is a powerful tool for making a girl become [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attached to a man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. The person in a lower position is the one who lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Lying indicates that the other person holds higher value in your eyes, whether out of fear, need, or caring about their opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. Therefore, never lie to a girl; always make her feel that you are honest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

Attractive women often assume men will lie due to their life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. When you demonstrate honesty, especially when it puts you in a bad light, it makes her question your confidence and lack of care for her opinion, which can be highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

*   **Honesty Under Pressure:** Humans observe how someone behaves under pressure to understand their true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. If you tell a story that makes you look good (e.g., winning a fight), it could be true or a lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. However, if you tell an embarrassing story (e.g., losing a fight), it's highly believable, and you're perceived as honest because you were truthful even when it made you look bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Unflattering Truths:** A student applied this by honestly stating he worked out "to get girls" when asked why he trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. This unflattering truth made the girl feel he was genuinely honest and didn't care about her judgment, leading her to initiate a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.
*   **Direct Honesty:** If she asks about a past fight, admit if you lost and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>. If you don't like her outfit, tell her it doesn't look good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>.

By being honest, especially in situations where it puts you under pressure, you demonstrate that you are the main character and are extremely confident, showing you don't care what she thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. These [[subcommunication_in_attracting_women | basic principles of attraction]] emphasize self-focus and authenticity over seeking external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

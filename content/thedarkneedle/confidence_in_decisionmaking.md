A significant trait attributed to an "older man" is being [[developing_a_confident_mindset | completely confident]] in his decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41">[06:41]</a>. As a man ages, he accumulates experiences that lead to firm convictions and beliefs, which are difficult to sway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43">[06:43]</a>. When such a man makes a decision, he does so resolutely, and external influences, including a woman's arguments, typically cannot alter his conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50">[06:50]</a>.

## How to Display Decisiveness

To demonstrate this [[developing_a_confident_mindset | certainty]] and [[importance_of_decisiveness_and_logic_in_building_attraction | decisiveness]], the key is to "stick to your guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57">[06:57]</a>. This means holding your ground, even when faced with difficult decisions that your partner may not agree with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02">[07:02]</a>. Regardless of pleas, arguments, or debates, you must remain firm if you are genuinely convinced your decision is the best course of action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07">[07:07]</a>.

### Practical Example: The Apartment Decision

Consider an instance where a discussion arose about moving to a new apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16">[07:16]</a>. The existing apartment was described as small but affordable and functional, while the girlfriend desired a slightly newer, more spacious place in a quieter neighborhood, believing it would improve their quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20">[07:20]</a>.

Despite the appeal of an upgrade, the decision was made to stay in the current place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35">[08:35]</a>. The rationale was that increasing expenses for a slightly larger apartment was not necessary, and financial flexibility, savings, or travel were more valuable uses of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42">[07:42]</a>. The speaker emphasized the importance of financial stability and long-term goals over temporary luxuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26">[08:26]</a>.

Initially, the girlfriend might have expressed a desire for the move, but eventually, she understood that it wasn't essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30">[08:30]</a>. The speaker later learned that she respected him more for his long-term thinking and for not being swayed by temporary desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>. This reinforced her trust in his ability to make [[importance_of_decisiveness_and_logic_in_building_attraction | rational financial decisions]], prioritizing what truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48">[08:48]</a>.

It suggests that saying no and standing your ground, even on minor issues, can paradoxically increase your attractiveness to a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>.

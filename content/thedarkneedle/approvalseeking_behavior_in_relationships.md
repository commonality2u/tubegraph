In emotional relationships, there is often one party striving to gain the other's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:28">[02:13:28]</a>. The video suggests that women generally share a common trait: a desire to gain the approval of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. This trait is described as an instinct deeply rooted in the genes of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. If a man can "feed" this instinct, it can lead a woman to seek his approval, effectively making her "his" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

## The Key to a Woman's Heart

The "key" to a girl's heart is to make her strive to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. This involves putting her in a state where she is the one who wants to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. This is presented as an easy task because the instinct to seek approval is already within women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

## Mindset Shift: Not Trying to Impress Her

A fundamental rule for attracting women is that you should not try to impress the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. One of the most attractive traits in a man is that he isn't overly concerned with gaining a woman's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. Modern society often places a high value on women, which can make men feel like they need to earn her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. This can program the subconscious mind to engage in [[avoiding_approval_seeking_behavior | approval-seeking behavior]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

### Recognizing Internal Pressure
When talking to a beautiful girl, you may feel an internal pressure to try to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. The first step to overcoming this pressure is to acknowledge it and be aware of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

### Redirecting the Pressure
Instead of trying to change the action driven by this pressure (e.g., telling her you're awesome), you need to redirect the pressure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. When you feel the urge to impress her, tell yourself: "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>. By stopping your own [[avoiding_approval_seeking_behavior | approval-seeking behavior]], you create space for her to want to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## The Recipe: Not Giving Immediate Validation + Stating Preferences

To push a girl into a state of seeking your approval, the strategy consists of two "ingredients":
1.  **Not giving her validation immediately** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Telling her what you like in a girl** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

### Component 1: Not Giving Immediate Validation
Since women naturally crave admiration and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>, for her to want to earn your validation, you must not give it to her easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This means avoiding immediately liking every post she shares, commenting on everything she posts, or appearing obsessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. If you give validation immediately, it "ends the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>.

### Component 2: Telling Her What You Like
Simultaneously, you should subtly express what you like in a girl's personality and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.

### How They Work Together
When she observes that you are not giving her validation, her internal instincts activate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. She starts to wonder why you aren't validating her and considers what she needs to do to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Upon hearing your expressed preferences, she will begin to do the things you like, automatically entering a state where she is trying to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

## Conditions for Application

There are specific rules to follow for this "recipe" to be effective:

### Condition 1: Partial Alignment of Preferences
When expressing what you like in a girl, a small portion (around 40%) of those qualities should already exist in her, but not everything (around 60% should not) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This prevents you from appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:34:00">[06:34:00]</a>. When an attractive girl typically receives validation for almost anything she does, your lack of immediate validation combined with stating preferences for things she doesn't fully embody makes her strive to meet those preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Condition 2: Express Preferences Generally
When you communicate what you like, speak in a general way that reflects only your opinion, nothing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. Do not follow up with direct suggestions like "you should cut your hair" or "wear green" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Do not imply that you are telling her these things so she can do them to gain your acceptance or become your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. The ability to express yourself effectively is an essential skill for attraction and charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>. When she hears your general preferences, she will automatically apply them to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

### Condition 3: Not Reacting to Everything She Does
Do not react to everything a girl does, especially if it's dull or silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. For instance, if she tells a boring joke, do not laugh just because she is beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. The correct behavior is to ignore or briefly glance and return to what you were doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>. While you might logically worry about her feeling embarrassed, making her slightly uncomfortable in such moments can contribute to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. By not reacting to everything, she will understand that you are not impressed by just anything she says or does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>. Always convey that your admiration requires her to have unique and exceptional qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

### Condition 4: Approaching with Curiosity, Not Admiration
When asking a girl questions to get to know her, your questions should stem from a place of curiosity, not admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:03:00">[11:03:00]</a>. Reflect this in your body language and tone, avoiding an overly eager smile or enthusiastic questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Internally, feel that you are asking purely out of curiosity, as if you haven't yet decided whether you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a>.

Additionally, never allow a girl to interrogate you, especially early in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>. Letting her take the lead by continuously questioning you gives her control of the conversation and puts her in a position to judge you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. You are the man and the one who chooses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. To avoid this, you can respond with phrases like "it's a long story," "take a guess," or give a short answer and shift the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

### Condition 5: Not "Matching" Her Efforts
When a girl begins to strive for your approval, she might mention qualities or accomplishments she possesses (e.g., "I practice Taekwondo," "I love kids," "I read books") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. This means she is trying to put herself in a superior position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. Your internal pressure to gain her approval might be triggered, especially if you have something in common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. For example, if she says she has a black belt in Taekwondo and you train in boxing, your instinct might be to say you also train in martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:00">[13:02:00]</a>.

However, if you respond by highlighting a similar achievement, you don't give her the opportunity to try to win your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. Instead, either comment casually or, preferably, make it seem like you are "bad" at the thing she is trying to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>. For instance, if she mentions Taekwondo, you could say, "I tried it once and I almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. If she excels at math, you could say you were terrible at it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. This gives her the space to impress you and show her capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>.

By combining and applying these techniques, a strong desire to win your approval can be created in a woman, putting her in a state where she actively tries to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

To persuade someone to adopt your perspective or fulfill your desires, a two-step process is advised: first, understand their internal state, and second, strategically select words to influence their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach is also applicable when trying to attract or win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Building Connection through Non-Verbal Cues

The quickest way to engage with someone's inner mind is by establishing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This means deliberately creating a "match" with another individual, as it's simpler to convince someone you feel connected to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The human brain constantly and unconsciously processes a vast amount of non-verbal information, including facial expressions and [[body_language_and_its_impact_on_conversation | body language]] (e.g., how a person sits, walks, or moves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Focusing on these non-verbal messages is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### The Body-Mood Connection

The concept of making a connection is rooted in the idea that your physical actions influence your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. By observing others' body movements and facial expressions, you can infer their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Furthermore, if you emulate their physical behavior, you may begin to experience similar emotions due to the direct link between your body and your mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

#### Practical Demonstration
To illustrate this, consider a simple exercise:
*   Walk with your head held high, looking at the skyline or treetops, and smile, even if it's not genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Then, walk with your head down, looking at the ground, slowing your pace, putting your hands in your pockets, and dragging your feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Notice the distinct change in your mood between these two postures, even without consciously thinking happy or sad thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This demonstrates that altering your posture directly impacts your mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Mirroring for Understanding and Influence

Since changing your posture affects your mood, mirroring someone else's posture can help you understand and adopt their emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This allows you to get inside their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. To form a connection, adjust your own mood to match theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

#### Steps to Adjust and Influence Mood:

1.  **Observe and Define Mood:** After observing someone's posture, pause to define their mood (e.g., bored, happy, sad, curious, enthusiastic, calm, nervous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Choose a Practice Subject:** For practice, select someone with whom you don't have a serious connection, such as a cashier, neighbor, or a stranger in an elevator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  **Mirror and Immerse:** Use your body to mirror their posture and define their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Immerse yourself in that mood by using inner dialogue, thinking of the defining word, and recalling past memories where you felt that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Truly experience the mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
4.  **Approach and Maintain:** Approach the person while maintaining the adopted mood and speak normally, keeping the mood consistent until you are both on the same emotional wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Continue until you feel the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
5.  **Shift and Observe:** Once the connection is established, gradually change your own gestures, posture, and smile towards the desired mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Observe how the other person's mood changes along with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This process allows you to influence them at a subconscious level using [[body_language_and_its_impact_on_conversation | nonverbal communication]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Adapting vs. Imitating

It's crucial to distinguish between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. You should subtly adapt to aspects of another person's movements without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Directly copying their gestures like a mirror is imitation and will only cause embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Verbal Influence after Connection

After building a connection, the way you use words can further enhance your influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Certain linguistic techniques can psychologically affect another person's subconscious, reducing refusals and increasing agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

These techniques include:
*   **Emphasizing the Obvious:** State something as obvious to make others believe it. Examples: "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Asking Non-Questions:** State what you want them to agree with and add a question tag at the end, using a decreasing vocal tone (e.g., "It's easy, isn't it?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Using "Let's":** Phrases like "Let's walk a bit more" are disguised orders that are more effective than direct questions like "Should we walk a bit more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Getting Multiple "Yeses":** Encourage several consecutive "yes" responses to train their mind to comply, saving your main request for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Offering Limited Choices:** Present two options, both of which are suitable for you, rather than allowing a "yes" or "no" decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   **Anticipating Future Reactions:** Tell them how you expect them to react to something (e.g., "I know you'll be thrilled about this") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Logical Leaps:** Use "therefore" or "this means that" to link a true statement with a desired conclusion, even if the connection isn't entirely logical (e.g., "You're watching this video, therefore you like it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Layered Orders:** Give the command you truly want them to follow, immediately followed by another command they are likely to follow, ensuring the first is subconsciously obeyed (e.g., "Take out the garbage and come to bed early") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Using "But":** The word "but" emphasizes what follows it. Place the point you want to highlight after "but" to give it more attention (e.g., "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **The "Ideal" Question:** Asking "What do you ideally want?" or "What would be the ideal result?" prompts others to truthfully express their desires, encouraging them to visualize perfect outcomes rather than perceived possibilities. This provides valuable information for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Tell It Without Telling It:** Express your point of view or give orders by stating what you "can't tell" them or "don't want" them to do (e.g., "I can't tell you to leave him, the decision must be yours") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **"Yes Means No":** Offer to do something you don't genuinely want to do by saying "I could... if you want" (e.g., "I could give you a ride home if you want") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **"It's Not Important But It Is":** Use phrases like "I know you won't consider my advice but..." to deliver feedback that might be unwelcome, ensuring the message is still conveyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   **"I Don't Know If You Realize":** This phrase is a polite way to demand attention and make the listener understand your point (e.g., "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day...") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

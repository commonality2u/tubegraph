When seeking a serious relationship, it's common to struggle with [[defining_your_ideal_partner | defining an ideal partner]] and [[understanding_red_flags_in_relationships | understanding red flags]]. Society often spreads terms like "red flags," "green flags," and "soulmates," which can lead to confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Attempting to find someone who perfectly matches a written list of desired traits and disliked "red flags" is often futile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. Lists of traditional "red flags" are considered unhelpful, as they may stem from a misunderstanding of how dating works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. For instance, the idea that a woman "shouldn't have male friends" is dismissed as nonsense because it implies she cannot interact with men at all, making it impossible for her to engage with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

Instead of focusing on superficial "red flags," it's advised to identify core traits that genuinely indicate an emotionally unhealthy partner.

## Traits to "Run Away From" Immediately

There are specific traits that, unlike minor preferences, a person cannot change and will lead to suffering in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. These are the true "red flags" to recognize and avoid.

### 1. Flirting with Other Men in Your Presence

A woman who flirts with other men around you may be trying to make you jealous or is simply seeking attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This behavior often correlates with wearing eye-catching clothes and loud makeup, and enjoying male attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. A relationship with such an individual is likely to be full of drama, as her habit of flirting will not cease and will become more frequent over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

<div class="callout is-warning">
[!WARNING] Do not show jealousy. The moment she perceives your jealousy, she "wins" because her primary goal was to elicit that reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
</div>

### 2. Still Attached to an Ex-Partner

If a woman frequently mentions her ex, expresses that she still thinks about him, or hasn't gotten over him, it's a sign to step back immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. She is carrying heavy emotional baggage from her past that she hasn't dealt with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. It's recommended to have a friendly conversation and even suggest she give her ex another chance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This demonstrates your high value and willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. Women who haven't moved past previous relationships will continually bring up their ex, negatively impacting the current relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### 3. Energy-Sucking Women

This is considered the most dangerous type of "red flag" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. These are women full of problems, from whom you should not hesitate to walk away for your own emotional health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

Key characteristics of "energy-sucking women":
*   **Deeply insecure:** They feel extremely insecure about themselves, regardless of their physical attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Constant validation seeking:** They constantly seek validation from you to feel good, but this need is never truly satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Endless emotional hunger:** They possess an "endless emotional hunger" that is impossible to fulfill, leading them to seek satisfaction through various means, including sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Low self-esteem and transactional sex:** Often suffering from low self-esteem, they may offer sex to any man in exchange for admiration, as a way to boost their self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Drama queens and manipulators:** They are frequently "drama queens" capable of turning good situations into chaos, and may resort to manipulation because they feel unworthy of good things in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

It is crucial to [[identifying_unrealistic_dating_expectations | filter out this type of woman]] based on their personality, not just their looks, and to understand them deeply before entering a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

## When a Girl Talks About Other Men

A common scenario is a girl talking about other men in front of you. This isn't always a "red flag" in itself, but it reveals her intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. There are two main reasons:

1.  **Trying to show desirability:** She is trying to convey that she is desired and liked by other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This means she is interested in you and wants you to know she's in demand, often hoping you'll ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.
2.  **Putting you in the [[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | friend zone]] / dumping emotions:** If she discusses an ex she can't get over, how much she loved him, or how she wants him back, she is trying to dump her emotions on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This is a classic sign of being put in the [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | friend zone]] and indicates she is genuinely interested in the other guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. This also means she is carrying heavy emotional baggage, and it's best to walk away and let her deal with it independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.

<div class="callout is-info">
[!INFO] **Leadership in Relationships:** In any relationship, there is a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. You should be the leader in your relationship with a woman, meaning you are in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She should wear what you want, follow your principles, and like what you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This control should never be forced or manipulative; she should *want* to do what pleases you out of her own will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This involves telling her what you want without forcing it or showing that you *need* her to do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. If she doesn't change, do not give it attention, which demonstrates you don't *need* the change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Over time, as her [[dangers_of_overcommitting_emotionally_early_in_a_relationship | attachment to you grows]], she will naturally align with your preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Never change your own thoughts or self because of a girl, as this causes you to lose your leadership position and her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Attracting women is simpler than often perceived, largely hinging on fundamental principles rather than superficial tips like having a strong body, money, or seduction techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Success in relationships stems from a state of mind, as inner feelings reflect in actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Women judge based on the feelings circulating within a man, not solely on looks, words, or wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. For instance, nervousness around a woman can lead to rejection because she senses a lack of confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Conversely, approaching with confidence, calmness, and relaxation elicits a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to project an image of a man naturally desired by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Approval Seeking

A common pitfall is the tendency to pander to a woman's every whim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. Placing a woman on a pedestal, as if she's a future spouse, indicates an inner sense of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This hidden deficiency drives men to go to great lengths to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Trying too hard to impress or get attention is often counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The moment a man stops [[approvalseeking_behavior_in_relationships | seeking approval]], that's when a woman is genuinely impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. This occurs because women are accustomed to men trying to woo them, so a lack of such efforts captures their attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

### The Quest for Validation

The [[avoiding_the_trap_of_seeking_validation_from_women | quest for validation]] is deeply tied to self-perception and self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Men who constantly [[approvalseeking_behavior_in_relationships | seek approval]] often struggle with low self-esteem, surrendering their power for acceptance or validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This behavior stems from an underlying [[dealing_with_fear_of_rejection_in_relationships | fear of losing the girl]] even before interaction begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. They act to avert potential rejection, often seeking validation to confirm they are on the right path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

The mental journey of an [[approvalseeking_behavior_in_relationships | approval Seeker]] involves instantly developing strong interest in an attractive woman, leading to a mindset of trying too hard and sacrificing power for approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. When a woman senses this craving for approval, she can lose interest almost immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The desperate need for approval is a significant deterrent to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Indifference to Outcome

Men who effortlessly attract women do not attach themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. They understand that rejection is an insignificant part of dating and are not bothered by a woman's reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Their primary concern is to enjoy the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Being indifferent to the outcome means not fretting about the woman's response and focusing on making the most of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## How to Avoid Approval-Seeking

*   **Don't overvalue physical attractiveness:** Avoid awarding extra points to a woman merely for her looks, especially since physical attractiveness is not something she necessarily worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Behaving unusually or nervously around an attractive woman can ruin interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   **Challenge her perceptions:** By not readily offering validation like the average guy, a man can pique a woman's interest, causing her to seek his validation and prove her worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This categorizes him as unique and different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.
*   **Don't settle:** A man who understands attraction never settles for less than what he truly desires in a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. He has high standards and sticks to them, choosing the women he dates rather than accepting whoever is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Maintain principles:** A man of value prioritizes his principles above all else, even the woman he is with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. He is not afraid to step back if his principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. A high-value man knows there are many other options and is confident in his worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.
*   **Make her strive for your attention:** Women tend to value men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. When a man doesn't react like the average man, a woman believes there's something special about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Don't be an "open book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Showing interest then quickly disinterest can provoke a strong emotional reaction, making her curious and challenging her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Don't modify your behavior or lifestyle:** It is a common mistake to [[changing_behavior_to_avoid_being_ignored_by_women | modify behavior]] or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, often stemming from a [[dealing_with_fear_of_rejection_in_relationships | fear of not meeting her expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Reshaping your life to suit hers sends a message that you view her as higher value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. A man should not alter who he is to make a woman feel at ease; if she doesn't appreciate aspects of him, she doesn't deserve him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. She should adapt to his reality if she wants to be with him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Recognize abundance:** A high-value man understands there's no shortage of attractive women and doesn't fixate on one woman, putting all his hopes in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. He sees abundance, not scarcity, in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

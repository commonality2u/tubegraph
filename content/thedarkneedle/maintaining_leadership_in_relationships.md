Losing a woman's respect is the quickest way to lose both the woman and yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There are three common mistakes that can prevent you from gaining her respect.

## Mistake 1: Not Distinguishing Between Seeking Approval and Seeking Advice

A woman naturally loves to help and enjoys offering support, bonding emotionally through giving support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Asking a girl for advice can be a fast way to create a connection, whether short-term or long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. However, many men mistakenly seek approval when they think they are asking for advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

While it's not wrong to ask for a partner's opinion, especially on matters that affect both of you, the problem arises from *why* the question is asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Many men ask not to hear her opinion, but to be reassured they are making the right decision, or to gauge if their actions will upset her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

The moment a man's decisions are filtered by "how will she react?", he is no longer acting on his values but on fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Women quickly notice this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. When decisions are based on pleasing her, she becomes the center of your life, and her respect for you begins to erode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This also makes a man easier to manipulate and more predictable, which women may test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Practical Application

*   When asking for her opinion about something you plan to do, do so because you genuinely want her perspective, not because you fear her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **For decisions related to your own life (e.g., travel, going out with friends):** Your decisions should not be based on her happiness or require her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
*   **For decisions involving both of you (e.g., choosing an activity together):**
    *   If you suggest an activity (e.g., movies) and she suggests another (e.g., pool), going along with her suggestion makes her the leader and causes you to lose her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   To maintain [[Strategies for maintaining leadership in relationships | leadership]], refuse her alternative and reassert your original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
    *   If she still insists on her choice, respectfully state your intention to proceed with your plan and go alone if necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
    *   Over time, this approach can lead her to accept your [[Strategies for maintaining leadership in relationships | leadership]] and follow you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   Her emotions should not control your life; prioritize your own desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Women inherently desire a man who is a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

## Mistake 2: Sending the Message That You Expect Her to Reject You

This mistake occurs when you interpret a woman's actions (e.g., posting a picture with another guy, not replying to a message) as personal rejection and then confront her about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This behavior signals that you anticipate rejection, which undermines your [[Building power and maintaining autonomy in relationships | power]] in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

A crucial rule to remember: All women, consciously or unconsciously, will initially avoid showing deep emotional attachment or a desire for a serious relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This is often a test of your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. If you become upset when she doesn't respond, it implies she holds more [[Building power and maintaining autonomy in relationships | power]], which diminishes her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Women are drawn to strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Practical Application

*   When a woman appears to reject you or gives the impression she's not interested, understand that she's testing your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.
*   Never discuss these perceived rejections with her. If she delays replying, tries to make you jealous, or talks about an ex, do not focus on it or bring it up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   Be aware of women who excessively try to make you jealous or lie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. If a woman shows disrespectful, tactless, toxic, or manipulative behavior early on, it's best to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   Playing manipulative games to build attraction lowers your [[Strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships | standards]] and attracts similar types of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. Setting clear [[Strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships | boundaries]] and high [[Strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships | standards]] communicates what you want and your willingness to walk away from anything that doesn't align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. You attract what you are, not just what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Mistake 3: Leaning Before It's Time

Leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and [[Emotional dynamics to maintain attraction | attraction]] for you is a surefire way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. While showing vulnerability can build intimacy, it's "emotional suicide" if a proper foundation of certainty and trust has not been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

A high-quality woman is willing to support her man through challenges, but he must first prove himself worthy of that support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If you show weakness too early, she may perceive it as a lack of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This can trigger fear and anxiety in her, potentially leading her to test you to determine if your vulnerability is an isolated incident or a consistent personality trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Case Study

A young man who broke down crying in front of a girl he was interested in, early in their relationship, later found himself tested. The girl, unsettled by his emotional display, asked him to stay up all night waiting for a specific song on the radio as a "reward" for a photo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. When he complied, she lost all [[Emotional dynamics to maintain attraction | attraction]] and ended the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited until she was more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper side, the outcome might have been different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

While men have insecurities and desire acceptance, exposing your soul to a woman who hasn't yet seen your strength and confidence can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

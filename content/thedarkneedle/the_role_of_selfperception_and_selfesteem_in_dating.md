Attracting women is presented as an easy process, simpler than commonly perceived, requiring a return to basic principles rather than superficial tips like having a strong body, money, or seduction techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. The key lies in understanding a fundamental formula for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

## The Foundation: Mindset and Feelings

Success with women is primarily a state of mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. What is in your mind reflects in your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Many men fail to attract women because they don't believe they deserve the company of an attractive woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.

A crucial principle is: "She feels what you feel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. Women judge men not on looks, words, or money, but on the feelings circulating within them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>. These feelings manifest in your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>. For example, nervousness can lead to rejection because a woman senses a lack of [[Mindset and Confidence in Social Interactions | confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>. Conversely, approaching with [[Mindset and Confidence in Social Interactions | confidence]], calmness, and relaxation elicits a more positive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:00">[00:49:00]</a>. To attract women, you must demonstrate that you consider yourself a man whom women naturally desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.

## Avoiding the Approval-Seeking Trap

A common mistake is putting a woman on a pedestal, pandering to her every whim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This behavior, such as saying things you shouldn't or going out of your way to impress, often stems from an inner sense of [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | inadequacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The most effective way to impress a woman is by *not* trying to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. When you stop seeking her approval, that's when she genuinely becomes impressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This unexpected behavior captures her attention because she's accustomed to men trying to woo her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.

The quest for validation is deeply rooted in [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | self-perception]] and [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | self-esteem]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. Men who constantly seek approval often struggle with [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | low self-esteem]], surrendering their own power for acceptance or validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. This implies an underlying [[Dealing with rejection and criticism in dating | fear of losing the girl]] even before interaction begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>. Such men are unsure of their actions, seeking validation to confirm they are on the right path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. When a woman senses you are craving her approval, she can lose interest immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. A desperate need for approval is a major [[The importance of confidence in attraction | attraction deterrent]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.

## Embracing Indifference to Outcome

Men who effortlessly attract women do not tie themselves to the outcome of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>. They understand that [[Dealing with rejection and criticism in dating | rejection]] is insignificant and merely a component of the dating landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Their primary concern is to enjoy the experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. When you are indifferent to the outcome, you don't worry about the woman's response; your focus remains on making the most out of every interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

## Maintaining Control and High Value

It is important not to lose [[Establishing boundaries and control in dating dynamics | control]] or award extra points to a woman merely for her looks, as physical attractiveness is not something she necessarily worked for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Behaving unusually jittery around an attractive woman can ruin things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

An intriguing phenomenon occurs when you avoid giving extra niceties solely based on her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. For example, if you challenge her perceived attractiveness or intelligence, she might start to seek your validation because you didn't readily hand it over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>. This categorizes you as "different and unique," making her genuinely interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>.

## Choosing, Not Settling

A man who truly understands attraction never settles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. He chooses the women he dates, always going for the best and the kind of women he truly wants, rather than just accepting whoever is available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. He has [[Establishing boundaries and control in dating dynamics | high standards]] and adheres to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

A man of value prioritizes his principles above all else, even the woman he is with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. He is not afraid to step back if his principles are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. He is [[Confidence and decisionmaking in relationships | confident]] in his worth and unafraid to stand alone, knowing there are plenty of other options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.

## Making Her Strive for Your Attention

Women tend to value men they have to put effort into understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. When you don't react like the average man, she starts to think there's something special about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. It's crucial to learn how to make a woman strive for your attention, avoiding being an "open book" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. A strategy involves showing interest and then quickly showing disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. For example, a high-value man might compliment a woman but then challenge her, provoking a strong emotional reaction and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>.

## Authenticity and Self-Acceptance

Many men mistakenly modify their behavior or lifestyle to align with a woman's preferences, often due to a [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | fear of not meeting her expectations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. This is likened to a dead fish in a stream, where you lose [[Establishing boundaries and control in dating dynamics | control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>. By reshaping your life to suit hers, you send a message that you view her as higher value and that you need to change to match that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

The truth is, you shouldn't alter who you are just to make a woman feel at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. If she doesn't appreciate certain aspects of you, she doesn't deserve you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>. If she can't accept you as you are, she's the one who needs to change and adapt to your reality if she wants to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>. A high-value man is not overly concerned with other people's opinions or judgments; he shapes his own reality and follows his own course <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:30:00">[10:30:00]</a>. He understands there's an abundance of attractive women, so he doesn't fixate on one, seeing opportunities rather than scarcity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>.

This approach to dating is a [[Mindset and selfesteem in relationships | mindset]] shift that requires action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

Many men struggle with [[creating_engaging_conversations_with_women | running out of things to say]] when talking to women, often falling into a pattern of mundane "get to know you" inquiries that resemble a "human questionnaire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This approach not only bores the woman but also prevents genuine engagement, as men tend to "leap frog" from one question to the next without expanding on topics of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The key to more dynamic and interesting conversations lies in shifting from a question-based interrogation to an [[effective_conversation_starters_and_openers | engaging dialogue]] that builds rapport and allows for deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Strategies for Deeper Conversation

### 1. Follow Questions with Statements

Instead of immediately asking another question after a woman answers, follow up with a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This demonstrates active listening and the ability to connect on a deeper level, transforming a monotonous Q&A into an [[creating_engaging_conversations_with_women | engaging dialogue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This approach allows for expansion on topics and injects fun and banter into the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Pets Discussion
> **You:** "So, do you have any pets?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, I actually have three of the cutest cats in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
> **You:** "Ah, so you're one of those cat people, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>
> **Her:** "No, I'm not one of those crazy cat ladies, I just love my cats." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>
> **You:** "They say people who like cats tend to be more independent than dog lovers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>

### 2. Playfully Qualify Her

Once rapport is established, men often become afraid of shattering the connection by sticking to "safe topics," which can bore a previously interested woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Instead, begin "qualifying" her by making statements that might playfully "disqualify" her as a potential partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This creates a dynamic where she feels compelled to prove herself to you, shifting the conversation from small talk to a playful battle of wits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Pets Discussion (with Qualification)
> **You:** "So, do you have any pets?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, I have three of the cutest cats in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>
> **You:** "Hmm, we would never get along. I'm a dog person, and I've heard that dog and cat owners tend to have a really intense sexual connection but disagree on every other possible point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
> **Her:** "Oh, really? Well, maybe we could find some common ground." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>

### 3. Use Cold Readings to Delve Deeper

Men often discuss facts, events, and surface-level stories, which limits the conversation from areas that ignite passion in a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Women typically prefer to talk about the mystical or dive into deeper, emotional meanings behind facts and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. To tap into this, use a cold reading, which involves stating something you've noticed about her and then making a deeper observation about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Dating Habits Cold Read
> **You:** "I can tell just by the way you're talking that you're the kind of girl who goes on a lot of dates but has trouble finding someone you're actually interested in. Then when you find that person, you usually lose interest very quickly." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, that's so true!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
> **You:** "I bet you really love adventure; sometimes it scares you, but deep down you crave something exciting. What's probably happening is that every time you meet these guys, you sense that they're not going to satisfy that adventure you crave." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
> **Her:** "Exactly! It's like they don't understand what I'm looking for." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>

This approach allows you to delve into emotional realms, disqualify other guys, and present yourself as someone new and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### 4. Emphasize Passion and Enthusiasm

Most men stick to "interview mode" topics like work and school, failing to demonstrate their passionate side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Women often look for "passionate" men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Emphasize the things you are [[using_passion_and_enthusiasm_to_enhance_conversations | passionate and enthusiastic about]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Passion can elevate even mundane subjects like cooking into an engrossing conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Show your drive and what truly motivates you, whether it's travel, business, music, art, or movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

### 5. Keep the Conversation Playful with Teasing

When men approach attractive women, they often treat them like royalty and become afraid of offending them, causing the conversation to fizzle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Women, like men, want a guy who is fun to be around and can help them relax and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The point of teasing is to [[creating_excitement_in_interactions | create a fun environment]] where a woman can loosen up and open up to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This means being silly, picking on her in a fun and flirtatious way, and dropping your "cool guy" image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Teasing Examples
> *   Getting ready to give her a high five, then pulling your hand away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
> *   Imitating her in a playful manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
> *   Suggesting she's coming on to you, e.g., "Woah, slow down there, at least buy me dinner first!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
> *   Telling an overly exaggerated lie and picking on her for believing it, e.g., "Wait, you actually thought I have a pet dragon?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>

These types of playful interactions are more engaging than discussing mundane topics like the weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### 6. Provide Multiple Conversational Threads

Running out of things to say often happens because men don't recognize how to smoothly change a conversation thread or provide enough new threads for the woman to grab onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Men frequently miss new conversation topics because they are too focused on what they will say next, rather than actively listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

When crafting your sentences, try to present several different topics she can latch onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Baseball vs. Nostalgia
> Instead of: "I love baseball." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
> Try: "I love baseball because when I was young, my father used to take me to games, and now that I'm older, I feel a real sense of nostalgia toward it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>
>
> This gives her options: she can talk about baseball, a story about her dad, or things that make her feel nostalgic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Listen for openings she provides and use a word or idea to improvise to a completely new topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Cooking to Travel
> **Her:** "I love to cook. My mom taught me how to cook, and now I even find myself watching those cooking shows on TV." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
> **You:** "Yeah, I'm the same way with those travel shows on TV. I start watching them and get sucked into all the amazing locations. So, where would you go on vacation if money wasn't a factor?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>
>
> This seamlessly transitions from "TV" in her statement to "travel shows" and then to "vacation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### 7. Focus on Evoking Positive Emotions

Women generally prefer to discuss the meaning behind actions and the emotions they evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Emotions arising during a conversation can subconsciously anchor to you, meaning if you discuss negative experiences, she may associate those feelings with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to draw her into a positive emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This can be achieved through teasing or by asking questions and making statements that prompt her to talk about specific positive feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

> [!EXAMPLE] Snowboarding to Adventure
> **You:** "Did you do anything fun last weekend?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>
> **Her:** "Yeah, I went snowboarding. I had the best time!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>
> **You:** "Wow, I love snowboarding! I think I'm literally addicted to the rush I get going down the mountain. What about you? What excites you most about snowboarding?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>
> **Her:** "Well, I guess it would be that feeling of adventure, going so fast, being a little scared but not wanting it to end because it feels like you're living!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>
>
> By focusing on the feelings of "adventure, excitement, and truly living," you put her in a positive mood and subconsciously anchor those feelings to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

Beautiful women desire [[creating_engaging_conversations_with_women | fun and flirtatious conversations]] just as much as men do, and there are few men who know how to truly peak a woman's interest through talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. By overcoming nervousness and anxiety and applying these [[techniques_for_focused_conversation | techniques for focused conversation]], men can move beyond dull interactions and create [[creating_positive_emotional_connections_through_dialogue | positive emotional connections through dialogue]] that are both interesting and memorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose the woman herself, and to lose yourself as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. There are three mistakes that can prevent a man from gaining a woman's respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Mistake One: Not Distinguishing Between Seeking Approval and Seeking Advice

Women inherently enjoy helping and offering support, which can be a strong way for them to bond emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Asking a woman for advice is one of the quickest ways to create a connection with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. However, many men mistakenly ask for advice in a way that suggests they are actually seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

While consulting a partner for their opinion, especially on matters affecting both individuals, is not wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>, the issue arises when the underlying reason for asking is not to hear her opinion, but to be reassured of a decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This often manifests as phrasing like, "What do you think if I go out with the guys tonight?" or "Do you think I should accept this opportunity?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>, but what is truly being conveyed is, "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

When a man's decisions are filtered by concern for his partner's reaction, he stops making choices based on his own [[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships | values and principles]], and instead bases them on fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Women often notice this shift quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. If decisions are primarily aimed at pleasing her, she becomes the center of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Even if she doesn't explicitly react, respect begins to erode the moment she perceives that her approval is needed for him to be himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This behavior also makes a man easier to manipulate and more predictable, which women may unconsciously test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### The [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | Leader]] vs. Follower Dynamic

When making decisions that only involve oneself (e.g., traveling, going out with friends), one should not ask for a partner's opinion or wait for her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For decisions involving both individuals, the distinction between a [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | leader]] and a follower becomes clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

If a man suggests an activity (e.g., going to the movies) and his partner proposes an alternative (e.g., going to the pool), acceding to her desire makes her the [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Although she might appear happy, this action can lead to a loss of her [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] and the man's [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | leadership]] position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Instead, a man should respectfully refuse the alternative and reiterate his initial preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. If she persists, he should state, "No, I don't want to go to the pool, but if you want to go, go ahead. I'll go to the movies," and then proceed alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Over time, this approach can lead her to stop opposing him and to accept his [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | leadership]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

::info
A woman's emotions should not control a man's life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. Prioritizing her desires over his own is illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Women naturally desire a man to be a [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships | leader]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Mistake Two: Sending the Message of Expected Rejection

A common mistake is reacting to perceived rejection, such as a girl posting a picture with another guy or not replying to a message, by initiating conversation about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This communicates an expectation of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

Women often unconsciously behave in ways that make it seem as though they haven't been impacted or are not emotionally attached early on in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This is a test of a man's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. A woman wants a strong partner, and if a man gets upset over a lack of response, she perceives him as weaker, which diminishes attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

::tip
When a woman appears to reject or tries to give the impression she doesn't want you, understand that she is testing your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. Never discuss this with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Do not focus on or discuss behaviors like delaying replies, trying to induce jealousy, or talking about ex-partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

### Setting Boundaries and Standards

While women may unconsciously test, a man must be aware of those who do so in an exaggerated way, such as constantly trying to provoke jealousy or lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If a woman behaves disrespectfully or tactlessly, especially early in a relationship, it signals a potentially toxic, dramatic, or manipulative personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Engaging in "games" to build attraction at this point means lowering one's standards, which attracts similar types of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Setting clear boundaries and strong standards communicates to the world what one desires and a readiness to walk away from anything that doesn't align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Manipulative men attract drama queens, and "nice guys" attract bossy, controlling, or manipulative women because they lack real boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Learning to outsmart such women is a waste of time when seeking a high-quality partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

::info
You don't attract what you want; you attract what you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. Having high standards increases the likelihood of attracting a high-quality woman with similar aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Mistake Three: Leaning Before It's Time

Leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] and attraction is a guaranteed way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While vulnerability can foster intimacy, it is emotionally detrimental if a proper foundation of certainty and trust has not been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

Women are naturally nurturing, but this support must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>. A high-quality woman will support her man if he has proven himself worthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. If a man leans on a woman before she is fully committed, she perceives it as weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Without prior conviction of his strength, this early vulnerability can introduce fear and anxiety into her mind, potentially leading her to test him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. She may test to determine if the moment of weakness was an isolated incident or a recurring part of his personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Example of Early Weakness Leading to Disrespect

An example describes a young man who, early in a budding relationship, opened up emotionally to a girl about his father's funeral, breaking down in tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Although she sympathized, she felt unsettled by his display of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Days later, when he asked for a photo of her, she decided to test him by telling him to stay up all night waiting for a specific song on the radio as a reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He fell into the trap, and she lost all attraction, breaking up with him shortly after <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

Had he challenged her unreasonable request or waited until she was more emotionally invested before revealing his deeper side, she wouldn't have pushed him away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. In early stages of a relationship, some women are not ready to deal with the full spectrum of a man's emotional side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While men have insecurities and desire acceptance, exposing one's soul to a woman who has not yet seen his strength and confidence can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

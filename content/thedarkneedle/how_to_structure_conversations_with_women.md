To successfully attract women, it is crucial to understand and apply specific conversational techniques and mindsets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The goal is to learn how to talk to women, understand their minds, and make them eagerly anticipate your next interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Foundational Mindset

Before engaging in conversation, it's essential to shift your internal perspective:

*   **Don't Overthink** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>: Avoid overthinking the topic of conversation or your delivery before you speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   **Humanize Her** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>: Remember that she is simply a human being, nothing more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Do not place her on a pedestal just because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Internalize the thought, "She's just a human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Adopt a Higher Position** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>: See yourself as being in a higher position while she is in a lower one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This concept will be explained further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Understanding Attraction and the "Radar"

Women are primarily [[emotional_vs_rational_communication_with_women | emotional beings]] and are drawn to what they feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Unlike men, women often make decisions driven by emotions rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Attraction is a subconscious response women have to certain behaviors exhibited by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

Key facts about attraction:
1.  Women do not control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  Women do not control who they are not attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

This means attraction operates on an unconscious level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Imagine a subconscious "radar" in a woman's mind that activates when you talk to her, scanning to determine if you are suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This radar is separate from her conscious mind, meaning if it wants you, her conscious mind cannot say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Women are biologically programmed to think emotionally, and their radar is disconnected from their logical mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

A woman's primary biological goal is to find the "right man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This "right man" is not consciously chosen but is sought out and selected by her internal radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

When you interact with a woman, her radar constantly scans to see if you appear to be better than her or if she is better than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. The radar assesses this by observing how you treat her, specifically whether you see yourself as better than her or vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. If you treat her in a way that shows you see yourself as better, her radar will recognize you as higher value, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Body Language Strategies

Forget complex rules about body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Focus on these three points to convey higher value:

1.  **Lean Away, Not Towards** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>: Leaning towards a girl indicates excessive interest and can be a turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. Instead, make it a habit to talk while leaning slightly away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Be Willing to Walk Away** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>: If she says something you disapprove of, almost start walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
    *   **Example**: If she says, "I'm not really interested," you could respond, "I know, I'm probably too much for you to handle, you're too much of a nice girl anyway," and then begin to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:39]</a>.
    *   Attractive girls are accustomed to being chased, so walking away demonstrates high value and increases attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:50]</a>.
3.  **Be Comfortable and Relaxed** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>: The person with higher value in a conversation is the one who sits comfortably and doesn't care about the other person's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Sit in a position that makes you feel at ease, without worrying about how she perceives you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Do what feels natural: put your hand in your pocket, lift your leg, lean back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   She will notice whether you are comfortable, not the specifics of your movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
    *   This mindset should apply to your entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Stop overthinking your body language to impress others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. When you act comfortably, she will perceive you as seeing yourself as better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Conversation Structure: The 50/30/20 Formula

To effectively [[creating_engaging_conversations_with_women | communicate with women]], follow this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>:

*   **50% of the conversation:** About her and her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **30% of the conversation:** About the environment or anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **20% of the conversation:** About you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

The reason for this imbalance (more about her, less about you) is that the person who talks extensively about themselves is often the one seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In a job interview, for instance, the conversation focuses on you because you need the job, and the interviewer is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Similarly, with women, talking more about her conveys that you don't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### Talking About Her (50%)

The conversation should revolve around her:
*   Her likes and dislikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   Her childhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   Her life plans and dreams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   What she enjoys in her free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   Her perceived positive and negative traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

This aligns with the "listen like a therapist" technique mentioned in previous videos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### Talking About the Environment/Anything Else (30%)

In this phase, avoid overthinking what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.
*   Say whatever comes to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   Treat her like a friend you've known for years; talk about anything and everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   It's acceptable to say something silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The key is not to appear as if you're trying to be profound or stick rigidly to one topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   Imagine yourself drunk and talking; just keep talking, even if it makes no sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Avoid appearing to convey a specific idea or talk seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.
*   If an argument arises, don't get angry or debate to prove your point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. Remember, you don't need her approval or constant agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

### Talking About Yourself (20%)

When discussing yourself, never try to appear amazing or boast about achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Self-Deprecating Humor**: Always make fun of yourself a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
    *   Tell stories that make you look silly or crazy, rather than impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. This shows you don't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Be Mysterious**: Incorporate an element of mystery into your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   This doesn't mean faking your personality, but rather not revealing too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   Avoid giving detailed answers to every question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Giving out too much information too quickly can signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
    *   **Examples**:
        *   Her: "Where do you work?"
        *   You: "Hold on there, speedy kitten, we've just met and you're already interviewing me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
        *   Her: "What are you doing Saturday night?"
        *   You: "Something exciting but secret, sorry, can't tell you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
        *   Her: "Have you ever been in a relationship?"
        *   You: "I don't know you that well yet, I don't discuss private stuff with strangers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
        *   Her: "So what's your name?"
        *   You: "Take a guess, I'll give you a candy if you get it right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
    *   By not revealing too much too early, she will always want to know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Handling Conversational Tests

The woman's subconscious radar will prompt her to perform "tests" to determine if you are genuinely the "right guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. These tests can cause men to panic and lose composure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. Strategies for [[understanding_and_handling_conversational_tests_from_women | dealing with these tests]] will be covered in upcoming discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

The feeling of missing someone is essential for attraction to develop and deepen into love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This emotion is a must-have in relationships, even at their beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Women, being emotional beings, need specific emotions to be planted within them for attachment to occur, and missing you is one of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

The concept of longing has historical roots; reminiscent of early humans, where men would disappear for long periods to hunt, their wives would experience longing during this time of absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Common Misconceptions: The "No Contact" Rule

Many people mistakenly believe that to make someone miss them, they must completely stop communicating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Online advice often promotes the "no contact rule," suggesting ceasing all communication, including social media posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. However, simply following this rule without specific underlying strategies can be counterproductive, potentially leading to the person forgetting you entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## The Two Phases of Making Her Miss You

The feeling of missing someone involves two primary phases:
1.  **When you are with her**: How you interact and communicate in person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.
2.  **When you are away from her**: When you are not physically present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Strategies for When You Are With Her

#### Create a Unique Identity

Drawing from marketing psychology, to embed yourself in someone's mind, you should link one or more of their senses to your "brand" (your personality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This means adding something unique to your personality that is consistently linked to a sensory experience:
*   **Hearing**: Use a unique signature phrase or word that no one else uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Sight**: Adopt a distinctive visual style in your clothing or always wear a specific, unique accessory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Smell**: Use a unique fragrance that becomes part of your identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

The goal is to create something unique and repeat it consistently, linked to one or more senses, for a stronger impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

#### End Conversations and Dates at Their Peak

It is crucial to end a conversation or date when it is at its most enjoyable point, leaving the person wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. This ensures that the last 10 minutes are very enjoyable, preventing the conversation from dragging on or becoming stale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

There are two ways to achieve this:
*   **The Hard Way (Humor)**: If you are naturally funny, you can end a conversation or date abruptly after a moment of shared laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. This is difficult to control consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **The Easy Way (Emotional Peak)**: Since women are emotional beings, they enjoy moments where they feel strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. When you are ready to leave, make her feel something strong, then abruptly end the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This will leave her mind in confusion and she will keep thinking about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

To evoke strong emotions, discuss topics related to the past or the future:
*   **Past Experiences**: Ask about her experiences (childhood, travel, career changes) and delve into the emotions behind them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For example, ask "How did it feel when you did...?" or "What was your feeling during that moment?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. You can relate by sharing different experiences that triggered similar emotions in you, but quickly shift the focus back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. This fosters a deeper [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | emotional connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Future Aspirations**: Discuss her goals, dreams, and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. This stimulates positive and hopeful emotions, which will then be associated with you in her subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Ask questions like "What are your biggest goals?" or "How would you feel if you accomplished that dream?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

By using these methods, you give her a reason to miss you when you're not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Strategies for When You Are Away From Her

The time when you are not with her is crucial, as this is when [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Many men feel pressured to constantly communicate, fearing they will be forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. However, [[the_role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | attraction builds during periods of absence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

#### Communication (Texting and Calls)

*   **Texting**: Avoid deliberately delaying replies to appear busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>, as women can see through such games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Instead, be genuinely unavailable for real reasons, such as work or commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. For example, tell her you don't use your phone before 7:00 PM due to being busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. The goal is to convey that you are a busy man with other priorities, not constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
*   **Phone Calls**: Never answer all her calls immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. If she can predict all your actions, she will lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Make her feel that you have a busy life and that other things are more important than instantly answering her calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. This subtle message increases her interest because she realizes she has to work to gain your attention, leading to increased effort on her part to attract you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

#### Dates

*   **Frequency**: Do not meet her all the time, especially early in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Aim for once or twice a week, at most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Planned Absences**: Incorporate long periods of absence from time to time, such as two weeks without seeing her and reduced communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. This absence should have a legitimate reason, like travel or focusing on a project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. This provides her the space and opportunity to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

By combining these strategies, you can trigger feelings of longing and curiosity, enhancing [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | her attraction]] to you when you are not present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

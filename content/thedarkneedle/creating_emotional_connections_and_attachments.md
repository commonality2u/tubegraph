This article explores strategies for building [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotional connection]] and fostering attachment, primarily focusing on romantic relationships. The core idea is that "drama" – the intentional stirring of a person's emotions – is key to making someone think about you and become attached [00:00:20].

## The Source of Emotion
To create deep attraction, you must be the primary source of the emotions felt by the other person [00:02:07]. External factors, such as a beautiful setting or an emotional movie, do not foster attraction towards you because the attraction will be directed towards the external source, not yourself [00:01:51]. This emphasis on personal influence aligns with [[using_empathy_and_understanding_to_build_connections | using empathy and understanding to build connections]] by making your interactions the catalyst for their feelings.

## Key Elements for Emotional Attachment
The following elements, when incorporated into interactions, can lead to the release of love hormones and foster attachment [00:00:42]:

### 1. Excitement
Excitement is generated by combining attention with a subtle hint of indifference [00:02:28].

*   **Complimenting and Critiquing:** Deliver compliments and critiques in a way that stirs emotions, rather than being a straightforward statement [00:02:33].
    *   **Example (Interest followed by indifference):** "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" [00:03:07]. This shows interest while hinting that you're not overly dependent on their approval [00:03:12].
    *   **Example (Indifference followed by interest):** "If this dress were pink, it would be better, but still it looks great on you" [00:03:33].
*   **Emotional Fluctuation:** The "last thing said" often leaves the strongest impression [00:03:39]. Creating a slight dip in emotion followed by a rise—for example, "You're so short, but still you're adorable"—creates an exciting rise and fall in emotions [00:04:06].
*   **Complete Attention:** It is acceptable to show complete attention when the other person does something you explicitly like, such as wearing a color you mentioned you love [00:04:21].

### 2. Enjoyable Presence
Making the other person enjoy spending time with you ensures that positive and fun thoughts come to mind when they think of you [00:04:42].

*   **Mindset Shift:** Focus on enjoying your own time first [00:05:00]. Be positive, relaxed, and spontaneous in your actions and words [00:05:02]. Say what amuses you, not just what you think will amuse them [00:05:05]. The golden rule is: to make someone enjoy being with you, you must enjoy yourself first [00:05:24].
*   **Talk About Your Passions:** People often reflect the emotions of others [00:05:33]. When you speak enthusiastically about topics you love, that joy and passion will be contagious [00:05:37].
*   **Transform Negativity into Positivity:**
    1.  Notice a perceived flaw or negative aspect [00:06:09].
    2.  Point it out [00:06:13].
    3.  Immediately transform it into something positive to make them feel better [00:06:15].
    *   **Example:** "Do you always wear this much makeup, or is it just for special occasions? ... Don't worry, you still look cute with it" [00:06:19].

### 3. Mystery and Ambiguity
Creating a sense of intrigue and keeping the other person guessing is vital for [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | maintaining attraction and emotional engagement]] and fostering [[emotional_connection_through_past_experiences_and_future_aspirations | emotional connection through past experiences and future aspirations]]. This is directly related to [[using_ambiguity_to_foster_emotional_connection | using ambiguity to foster emotional connection]].

*   **Unfinished Conversations:** Spark intense interest, then pull back before the conversation or moment reaches its peak, leaving them wanting more [00:06:48].
    *   **Example:** "Oh, I completely forgot I was supposed to tell you something really important. Wait, I have to make an important phone call. I'll tell you later" [00:07:03].
    *   **Example:** When asked about a second habit you dislike in women: "Well, I don't think you're ready to hear it yet. I'll tell you when you're ready" [00:07:32]. This tactic increases excitement, curiosity, and desire, making them think about you constantly [00:07:41].
*   **Ending Dates Strategically:**
    *   End a date when the conversation is still enjoyable and at its peak, rather than letting it become dull [00:07:50].
    *   Avoid promising another meeting [00:08:10]. This ambiguity makes them wonder if you enjoyed the time and why you didn't ask for another date, keeping you on their mind [00:08:24].
*   **Never Reveal Feelings Too Early:** Contrary to popular media, expressing feelings of love or strong interest too soon can kill attraction by removing the element of mystery [00:09:02]. Uncertainty about your true feelings is a primary driver of attraction [00:09:30]. This relates to [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotional communication in relationships]] and [[emotional_framing_techniques_for_attraction | emotional framing techniques for attraction]].
    *   If the other person confesses their feelings first, then it's acceptable to show you want them, but they should still want you more than you want them [00:09:50].
*   **Willingness to Walk Away:** A high-value individual prioritizes their principles and is willing to disengage if those principles are violated [00:09:59]. This demonstrates self-respect and confidence [00:10:31].
*   **Withholding Information:** Avoid providing overly detailed answers too soon [00:10:48]. This signals low value [00:10:59]. Instead, keep some information to yourself, letting them guess [00:11:18].
    *   **Example (Responding to "Where do you work?"):** "Guess, and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner" [00:11:18].
    *   **Example (Responding to "What are you doing Saturday night?"):** "Something fun, but it's a secret, sorry I can't tell you" [00:11:36].
    *   **Example (Responding to "Have you ever been in a relationship before?"):** "I don't know you well enough yet; I don't share personal things with strangers" [00:11:40].
    *   While mystery should gradually decrease over time, some degree should always be maintained [00:11:45].

### 4. Jealousy
Allowing a degree of jealousy, especially if the relationship is not serious or exclusive, can be a powerful tool for attachment [00:12:01].

*   **Admitting to Dating Others (Non-exclusive):** If asked about dating other women in a non-exclusive relationship, admit it (e.g., "Yes, there are a few girls I go out with") [00:12:07]. This makes them jealous and encourages them to put in more effort to keep you [00:12:13].
*   **Maintaining Female Friends (Exclusive):** Even in an exclusive relationship, occasionally interacting with other female friends can create a healthy level of jealousy [00:12:22]. When they express jealousy, reassure them that they are the one who truly matters [00:12:31]. This competitive dynamic makes them view you as a prize and increases their attachment [00:12:40].

### 5. Safety
A crucial emotion for any relationship, especially before physical intimacy, is [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | emotional safety in relationships]] [00:12:53].

*   **Authenticity:** Ensure your presented personality aligns with your true self [00:13:10]. Trying to impress someone by feigning interest in topics you don't genuinely care about (e.g., researching pop music to impress a fan) comes across as fake and undermines trust [00:13:18]. Being honest with your personality makes you seem trustworthy and genuine, fostering safety [00:13:48].
*   **Creating Security (Situational):** In situations like watching a horror movie, your lack of fear when they are scared can make them feel safe and secure when clinging to you [00:14:07].

### 6. Challenge and Respect
Avoiding constant agreement and occasionally engaging in respectful debate signals confidence and self-respect [00:14:27].

*   **Demanding Respect:** Always agreeing with someone can imply you don't know how to demand respect or fear losing them [00:14:35].
*   **Seeking a Challenge:** Women often seek a challenge [00:15:33]. If you agree with everything, you won't be perceived as one [00:15:34].

## Conclusion
A balanced mix of these emotions – excitement, enjoyment, curiosity, jealousy, safety, and a sense of challenge – is the ideal recipe for sustained attraction [00:15:37]. Unpredictability in your conversations, behavior, and expressions keeps the other person guessing and maintains a slight sense of mystery [00:15:49].

Attracting women is presented as a skill, not something dependent on inherent qualities like appearance or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. A man's perceived lack of success in dating is attributed to a lack of knowledge about how to attract women, rather than personal flaws <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is advised not to take dating failures personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, as social media often promotes [[identifying_unrealistic_dating_expectations | unrealistic expectations]] about what is needed to attract women, such as height, gym physique, wealth, or a beard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

The speaker notes that female attraction has evolved over millions of years and is not tied to modern societal constructs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Understanding ancient factors and how women think is key to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Being single is often due to behaviors that prevent women from considering a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Dating Market Dynamics: Male vs. Female Currencies

In the dating market, a woman's "currency" is sex, while a man's "currency" is commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### The Two Playing Fields
Any interaction or date has two possible objectives: sex or a committed relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The man is biologically ingrained to choose the direction of the meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   If the goal is sex or a one-night stand, the woman is the "prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   If the goal is commitment or a long-term relationship, the man is the "prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

It is generally easier for a man to "play in the commitment field" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While natural to desire sex, it should not be the primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Being "Sexual" vs. "Horny"
To play in the commitment field, men should program their subconscious to not only want sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a> and internalize that they are the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This is achieved by being "sexual" but not "horny" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

*   **Sexual:** Being comfortable with sexuality, seeing it as normal and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Horny:** Being sexually needy, aggressively seeking sex, having an agenda, and being dependent on a specific outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Never appear desperate for sex, as this automatically places the woman as the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A woman will not pursue a man if she perceives herself as the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Understanding Your Value: The Man as the Prize
To internalize being the prize, avoid giving attention and approval too easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Common mistakes include:
*   Immediately telling her she's beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Agreeing with everything she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   Excessively complimenting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   Giving her more attention than other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Just as a man isn't automatically entitled to a woman's body, women aren't automatically entitled to a man's attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Your time and energy should be given only to a girl who reciprocally invests her own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, which makes you valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

## Common Mistakes and Misconceptions

### Avoiding the Friend Zone
The idea that one must be a "good friend" before becoming a "good lover" is a common misconception perpetuated by romantic movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. In reality, once a man is in the friend zone, a woman typically won't see him as a potential romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. She will treat him like a female friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Attempting to make a move from the friend zone will likely cause her to "freak out" and avoid him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### The Ineffectiveness of Compliments
Showering a woman with compliments is a common mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. Compliments do not yield results and can make a man appear like "just another guy looking for sex" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

Attractive women live in a state of abundance regarding male options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. They are constantly approached and receive compliments daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Therefore, a simple compliment like "you're so beautiful" is not new or impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Such women tend to categorize men who solely offer compliments as those trying to "get with them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Understanding Female Nature: Emotion Over Logic

When interacting with women in dating or relationships, it's crucial to understand that they react based on emotions, not logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Words themselves matter less than the *feelings* they evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Attempting to use logic or justify actions, such as explaining a physical trait, will decrease a woman's attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:08:03]</a>. Attraction is an emotional and instinctual response, not a conscious choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### The Power of Subcommunication
What a man *communicates indirectly* (subcommunication) is more important than what he says directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Bragging about achievements:** While seemingly demonstrating high value, it subcommunicates insecurity and a need to prove worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
*   **Spoiling with gifts/expensive dates:** A man might think this shows he can provide and is amazing, but it often has the opposite effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### The "Bad Boy" Archetype Explained
Women are often attracted to "bad boys" because of their subcommunication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Arrogance, dominance, unpredictability:** These behaviors subconsciously send messages of higher value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
*   **Perceived qualities:** A woman subconsciously perceives confidence, high status, emotional independence, and a lack of need to please her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This makes him appear high-value, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

A man doesn't need to be a "bad boy" to be attractive; he can be respectful and kind while still being highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. The key is to understand this instinct and female nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Women are emotional beings who operate based on instinctual rules, which are easy to understand once known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Conclusion: Changing Behavior for Success
Being single or having unfulfilling relationships is often due to specific behaviors, not personal inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. Simply changing these behaviors can lead to success in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

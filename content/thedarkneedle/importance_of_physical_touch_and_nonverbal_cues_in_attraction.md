Building attraction involves more than just words; physical touch and nonverbal cues play a crucial role in creating comfort, expressing interest, and escalating connection.

## Establishing a Confident and Relaxed Demeanor

Before initiating an approach, it is vital to stay calm and relaxed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. If you are nervous, you might appear less [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | confident]], which can lead to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Overcoming this fear requires taking action, even starting with small steps like asking 10 women for the time daily (without a watch or phone) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This simple exercise can boost your [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]] and make you feel more at ease, improving your overall nonverbal presentation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Strategic Approach Angles

The way you approach someone significantly impacts their initial comfort level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   **Avoid Frontal Approaches** Never approach from the front, as she can see you coming and will likely put up a "wall of resistance" before you even speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Avoid Rear Approaches** Approaching from behind, by touching her shoulder or starting a conversation without notice, can scare her and immediately ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   **Optimal Side Approach** The best and most successful approach is from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This angle does not scare her and prevents her from activating her "wall of defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A recommended technique is to walk past her, tilt your head in her direction, and start the conversation while your chest faces the other direction (talking over your shoulder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This posture is non-threatening and makes her more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## The Role of Non-Threatening Openers and Body Language

Traditional, direct approaches (e.g., "Can I buy you a drink?") often fail because women are "strongly programmed to turn down every approach of this kind" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. They may assume you are only looking for casual sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Instead, your opening must demonstrate that you are not trying to "hit on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

A technique to achieve this involves pretending to be on a phone call, passing by, and then turning your head to engage her in a question (e.g., "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men, is that true?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Immediately stating you are in a hurry and have to go helps lower her defenses and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Being natural and observing the environment is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, in a restaurant, comment on her food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, or in a neutral environment, comment on her attire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.

### The Power of "Guessing" for Engagement
Instead of asking direct questions like "What do you do?" or "Where are you from?", try guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. For instance, "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This often elicits a "Why do you say that?" response, which naturally opens the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Physical Touch: Breaking Down Defenses
[[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | Physical touch]] is an extremely important aspect of sparking attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Playful, light physical touch doubles the impact of your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Easy routines for initiating touch include:
*   **Commenting on Nails** Stare at her hands, then gently grab her fingers and comment on her nails, suggesting a different polish color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Forehead "Cleanup"** Stare at her forehead, say she has something on it, and then lightly clean it with your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **Hair Compliment** Stare at her hair, compliment its color or style, and then touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **High Five** Give her a gentle high five while saying something like, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

If a woman allows you to touch her once, she has likely lowered her defenses, making it easier to escalate to more intense physical interactions like hugging or kissing later on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

## Advanced Tactics: Leveraging Social Dynamics
When approaching women in groups, avoid focusing solely on your target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Instead, spend more time talking to her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This strategy makes the target feel a bit jealous due to the lack of attention, increasing her curiosity and making her "work for your attention" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. After a few minutes of focusing on her friends, you will often notice the target working harder to gain your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

By integrating these nonverbal cues and strategic physical touches, you can enhance comfort, build attraction, and increase your success in social interactions.

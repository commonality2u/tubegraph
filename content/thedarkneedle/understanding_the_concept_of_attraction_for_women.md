Attraction is considered the most fundamental concept for success with women in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Without [[understanding_how_attraction_works | understanding how attraction works]], success in dating is unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Nature of Female Attraction

Unlike men, women tend to act based on how they feel, making decisions driven by emotions rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. They respond to feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, and because their actions are emotion-based, they essentially cannot control who they are attracted to or not attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

[[attraction | Attraction]] is a subconscious response women have towards certain behaviors exhibited by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Therefore, to trigger [[attraction | attraction]], men need to incorporate these specific behaviors into their personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## The Subconscious "Radar"

A crucial concept is that women do not consciously control who they are attracted to or not attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. [[attraction | Attraction]] occurs on an unconscious level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Imagine this subconscious part of a woman's mind as a "radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When a man starts talking to her, this radar activates and scans him to determine if he is suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This radar operates independently of her conscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. If this radar "wants" a man, her conscious mind will not be able to override that decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. This is why some women may repeatedly fall for "bad guys" despite their logical brain telling them otherwise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The primary biological goal for any woman, from birth, is to find the right man for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This "right man" is not chosen consciously but is sought out and selected by this internal radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The radar assesses many factors, particularly whether the man appears to be in a "higher position" than her, or if she is better than him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. It determines this by observing how he interacts with her and whether he treats her in a way that shows he sees himself as better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. If a man treats her in a way that demonstrates he sees himself as better, the radar will perceive him as superior, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Key Behaviors to Trigger Attraction

To make the radar understand that a man sees himself as better, certain behaviors are recommended:

### Body Language
*   **Avoid leaning in**: Leaning towards a girl while talking can signal being too interested, which can be a turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Instead, make it a habit to lean away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Willingness to walk away**: When a woman says something a man disapproves of, or expresses disinterest, he should almost start walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This demonstrates high value, as attractive women are typically used to being chased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   **Comfort and self-ease**: A man should sit comfortably and not care about how she perceives him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This means not overthinking posture or specific hand/leg placements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>. The person with higher value in a conversation is the one who sits comfortably and appears unconcerned about the other person's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Being comfortable and not caring what she thinks makes a woman feel a man sees himself as better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Conversation
A specific communication formula is suggested for talking to women:
*   **50% about her and her personality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>: This includes asking about her likes, dislikes, childhood, life plans, dreams, free time activities, and self-perceived positive and negative traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **30% about the environment or anything else** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>: During this phase, a man should say whatever comes to mind, like talking to a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. It's acceptable to say silly things; the important thing is not to appear as if trying to be serious or convey a specific idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He should avoid getting angry or debating to prove a point, remembering he doesn't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **20% about himself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>: When talking about himself, a man should never try to boast about achievements or adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Instead, he should make fun of himself slightly, telling stories that make him look silly or crazy rather than great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This demonstrates that he doesn't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Mystery
An element of mystery in a man's personality is encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This means not revealing too much information about oneself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Giving overly detailed answers to questions can unintentionally signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. By withholding information, a man ensures she will want to know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Tests
As a woman's radar scans a man, it will push her to perform "tests" to see if he is "the real deal" or just pretending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. These tests can cause men to lose composure or make the woman doubt his genuineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. How to deal with these tests will be discussed in future episodes of this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

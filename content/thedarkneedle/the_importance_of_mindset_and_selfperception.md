[[Mindset shifts for dating success | Mindset]] and self-perception play a crucial role in how individuals interact with others, particularly in dating and social situations. A key concept involves adopting the mindset that "I am the main character; she's just a side quest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Society's Influence on Self-Perception
Modern society, through media like movies and social media, often trains individuals from a young age to perceive a woman as the ultimate goal or reward for hard work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. This can lead to a [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | mindset]] where women are placed on a high pedestal, causing men to view themselves as secondary characters in their own lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

An illustrative anecdote describes an attempt to impress a girl by researching her field of study (rehabilitation sciences) to appear smart and educated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach, centered around trying to appeal to her interests, resulted in being "completely ignored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. The mistake was making the girl the "main character" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

Instead, individuals should cultivate a [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | self-perception]] where they are the main character, and others, including potential romantic interests, are supporting characters whose role is to add enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

## Strategies for Cultivating a Main Character Mindset

### Control the Conversation Topic
The person with more value in a conversation is generally the one who chooses the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. A common mistake is trying to talk about a girl's interests to impress her, which often leads to the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Instead, talk about subjects you genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. While this doesn't mean exclusively talking about yourself, it means directing the conversation towards topics that resonate with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

Consider the difference between discussing facts and emotions. When speaking with someone, focusing on emotions can lead to a deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. For instance, instead of discussing the science of exercise, ask *why* someone enjoys training and explore the emotions behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The core principle is never to talk about something you don't care about merely to impress or gain attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### Don't Seek Validation
A crucial aspect of demonstrating a strong [[developing_a_confident_mindset | mindset]] is showing that you don't need to prove anything to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This conveys that the other person is not the most important thing in your life and not the main character in your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Examples include:
*   If someone claims you're lying about a story, agree playfully: "Yes, I'm a liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   If interrupted, don't try to force your words or return to the original topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This subtly communicates that their opinion isn't paramount to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. The mindset should be: "Whether people listen to me or not, I'll still be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

This approach demonstrates [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | self-confidence]] and reinforces that you are the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.

### Practice Complete Honesty
Honesty, particularly in situations that might make you look bad, is incredibly powerful in fostering connection and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Lying often stems from perceiving the other person as holding higher value, or from fear or need <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

Attractive individuals, especially women, are accustomed to people lying to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When they encounter someone who is consistently honest, even about unflattering truths, it signals a high level of [[building_selfesteem_and_mindset | self-confidence]] and a lack of concern for external validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

Consider this example:
> Imagine someone asks if you've ever been in a fight. If you say you won, it might be true or a lie, and doesn't reveal much about your character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. If you honestly admit you lost and were beaten up, it's far more believable and establishes you as an honest person, even "under the pressure of looking bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

One student demonstrated this by responding honestly when asked why he works out, stating "to get girls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. This candid and unflattering truth made the girl present feel that he was genuinely honest and unconcerned with her opinion, leading to a long conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

To appear honest, practice saying the "uncomfortable truth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This [[selfleadership_and_personal_responsibility | self-leadership]] demonstrates that you are the main character, extremely [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | confident]] in yourself, and unaffected by external judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

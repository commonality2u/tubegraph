At the core of all effective [[high_value_man_mindset_and_principles | social skills]] is a deeply ingrained human instinct: a hunger for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Humans instinctively love to feel that they possess value within their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. By understanding and properly satisfying this hunger in others, one can win them over and influence their actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This skill is paramount, as communication skills are said to account for 85% of life's success, even for endeavors like starting a YouTube channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Power of Validation

The concept of feeding this instinct can be illustrated by an anecdote of a math tutor and a struggling student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite the student's academic difficulties, the tutor acknowledged his diligence by saying, "You are slow to understand and you're stupid but you have one great thing you are hardworking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This simple act of [[acknowledging_and_recognizing_qualities_in_women | recognition]] was a form of positive manipulation, motivating the student to study with newfound energy, not just for success, but to prove he deserved the praise and to impress the tutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This demonstrates how effectively feeding this instinct can make you the most loved person in your [[encouraging_admiration_and_influence_in_social_circles | social circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Strategies for Satisfying the Instinct for Value

Properly satisfying this inherent human desire involves specific techniques that make others feel valued.

### Making Them Feel Impressed

A golden rule in social interaction is: if you want to influence someone, you need to make them feel like *they* left an impression and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Rather than trying to demonstrate your own amazing qualities, focus on making *them* feel amazing and remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This is achieved primarily through **focused conversation**:
*   **Let them talk about themselves**: When someone shares an experience, build on what they say rather than shifting the focus to your own similar experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Keep the conversation centered on them and their narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Redirect general topics**: Even when discussing mundane subjects like the weather, pivot the conversation to their personal preferences or experiences related to the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

By doing this, you give them value and satisfy their instinct, making them feel they have influenced you, which in turn influences them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Not Trying to Prove Yourself

A powerful display of strength in social interactions is to avoid trying to prove anything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Ignore minor interruptions**: If someone interrupts you or changes the subject, let them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Insisting on returning to your original point can appear [[understanding_and_addressing_neediness_in_relationships | needy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This demonstrates that your words were not intended to prove anything to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Directly address constant interruptions**: If someone consistently interrupts, it's appropriate to calmly and directly ask them to let you finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. As a man, expressing yourself clearly and directly is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. If they persist, it may be best to disengage from the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

When others sense that you don't need to assert yourself, they will feel the need to prove themselves to you, thereby increasing your value in their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### Recognizing Their Presence as a Person

Value people for who they are, not for their possessions or accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Avoid interrogating questions**: Do not immediately ask about their job, education, or income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The person should feel you care about them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Refrain from unsolicited advice or lecturing**: Do not offer advice or tell people they need to change unless specifically asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows acceptance of them as they are, problems included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Never place yourself above others**: Avoid acting superior or trying to correct minor, inconsequential facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Correcting trivial errors gains nothing and can embarrass the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Giving Them the Opportunity to Earn Your Admiration

[[encouraging_admiration_and_influence_in_social_circles | Encouraging admiration and influence in social circles]] is a key aspect of social skills. When someone begins trying to gain your admiration, it signifies that you have already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   **Ask for their opinion**: Most people are self-focused in conversation. Learn to ask for others' opinions and genuinely listen to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Listen to their suggestions**: When someone offers advice or suggestions, listen to them rather than immediately rejecting their ideas or treating them as if they don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. You can acknowledge their suggestion without outright rejecting it, for instance, by saying you need to think about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

It is crucial to never look down on anyone, regardless of their education or age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Treat them as your equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## The Fallacy of "Being Yourself"

The advice to "be yourself" is often counterproductive when it comes to social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Just as someone wanting to quit smoking or lose weight needs to change their behavior, communication is a skill that requires practice and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. These social strategies are not about faking it, but about developing and refining an essential life skill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

Effective [[communication strategies in relationships | communication]] that focuses on emotions rather than logic is key to fostering deeper connections and romantic interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

The speaker's personal journey illustrates this point: initially categorized as undesirable due to social awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, then as "just a friend" after learning basic social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The shift to being seen as a potential boyfriend occurred only after understanding and applying the principle of stirring emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Speaking to Emotions

The fundamental difference between a platonic friendship and a romantic relationship (e.g., boyfriend-girlfriend) lies in the presence of emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. To be perceived as a potential partner, one must know how to evoke and engage with a person's feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

There are two primary ways to stir emotions:
1.  **Entering feelings into her:** This method is generally not effective at the beginning of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Bringing feelings out of her:** This is the most immediate and effective approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. When a person expresses their feelings, the door to their emotions opens, allowing for a deeper [[emotional investment in relationships | emotional investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

To encourage others to express their feelings, employ the "listen like a therapist" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This involves asking emotional questions and listening intently to the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Crafting Emotional Questions
Emotional questions are designed to elicit feelings rather than just facts. They shift the conversation from [[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | logical, cold communication]] to a more expressive, emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

**Characteristics of Emotional Questions:**
1.  **Elicits Feelings:** The question should prompt the other person to express emotions such as anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, or passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   **Example:** Instead of asking "What do you study?" (logical), ask "Do you like this field? Why or why not?" (emotional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This encourages them to share their internal feelings about their studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Promotes Long, Expressive Answers:** The ideal emotional question encourages a detailed and heartfelt response, rather than a simple "yes" or "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. If a short answer is given, follow up with "why?" to prompt further expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Active Listening
Once emotional questions are posed and the other person begins to share, **listen carefully** without interrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. The goal is to allow them to express themselves as much as possible, as this process directly engages their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

### Transforming to Emotional Conversation
An emotional question is merely a key to unlock an emotional conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. After they share their story, identify points within their narrative that can be transitioned into new emotional inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   **Example:** If they mention liking the Metropolitan Museum of Art, you can ask, "Wow, do you like art? Why?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Continue this pattern, always encouraging them to talk about emotional things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This deepens the conversation, making it memorable because emotions were stirred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Avoiding "Interview Mode"
Do not simply ask a series of unrelated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Questions should be related and build upon each other, allowing one topic to complement another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Conversation Ratio
In conversations, especially at the beginning, the other person should ideally be talking around 70% of the time, while you talk only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Case Study: The MBTI Test

The speaker used the MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) personality test as a framework for an [[effective communication in dating | effective communication]] strategy with a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. By asking questions from the test and prompting the date to elaborate and share stories, an emotional connection was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. This led to an unexpected development in their relationship, highlighting that for women, sexual desire is often triggered by experiencing emotions, especially if those emotions are caused by the speaker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Recommended Emotional Questions: The 36 Questions to Fall in Love

Social psychology researcher Arthur Aaron developed a list of "36 questions to fall in love," which aim to reveal personal details and foster intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. These questions are structured in three sets, with intensity gradually increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. An experiment with strangers asking each other these questions resulted in significant attraction and even marriages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

**First 10 Questions from Arthur Aaron's List:**
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

It is important to understand the concept behind these questions, not just memorize them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The secret is knowing how to transform a regular conversation into an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Important Considerations

*   **Creativity:** Be creative in applying these techniques; avoid coming across as robotic or rehearsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **Beyond Dating:** The principles of emotional communication and the "listen like a therapist" technique can be applied to any interaction to create a deep and memorable connection with people, not just in romantic contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   **Holistic Approach:** While powerful, this technique is just one aspect of effective interpersonal skills. For deeper connections and to avoid being relegated to the "therapy zone," it should be integrated with other strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

A foundational concept in social skills is understanding the deeply ingrained human instinct for valueâ€”a "hunger for value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Humans desire to feel valuable in their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Satisfying this hunger correctly can win someone over and make them receptive to your influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This approach can be seen as a form of "positive manipulation" that motivates individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## The Power of Specific Praise

One potent example of using positive reinforcement is a math tutor's experience with a struggling student <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. Despite the student's academic difficulties, the tutor acknowledged his "hardworking" nature, suggesting it would eventually lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. This specific praise motivated the student to study intensely, not just for success, but to please the tutor and prove he deserved the commendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. This demonstrates how feeding a person's instinct for value can lead to significant positive changes in their behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Strategies for Giving Value

To properly "feed this instinct" in others and become a well-regarded individual in your social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>, it's crucial to learn the correct methods for giving value.

### Make Them Feel They Influenced You

A golden rule for leaving a positive impression and influencing someone is to make them feel as though *they* were the one who left an impression and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. Instead of trying to demonstrate your own impressive qualities, focus on showing them that *they* are remarkable and amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.

This can be achieved through focused conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>, making the dialogue revolve around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Two ways to do this include:
*   **Building on their statements:** Allow them to speak about themselves and then expand on what they've shared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. For example, if someone recounts a bad date, instead of sharing your own similar experience, ask "what did you do about it?" or "how did the date go?" to keep the focus on them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Redirecting general topics:** Take a common subject and steer it towards their personal preferences or experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. For instance, when discussing the weather, ask "what do you like more, rain or sunshine? Summer or winter?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

By doing this, you satisfy their intrinsic desire for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>, allowing them to feel influential and giving them an opportunity to prove themselves and earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. The moment someone begins to seek your admiration, it signifies you have already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This is a powerful component of [[Psychological Strategies to Enhance Attraction]].

### Displaying Strength by Not Needing to Prove Yourself

To encourage others to seek your admiration, refrain from trying to prove anything to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Show that you don't need to assert an idea or point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

For example, if someone interrupts you during a conversation or changes the subject, allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Don't insist on returning to your original point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. This demonstrates that you don't need to assert yourself, which is perceived as a display of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. The strongest individuals in society are those who don't feel the need to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

However, if interruptions become constant and disrespectful, it's appropriate to calmly and directly ask, "Why don't you let me finish what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. If they persist, it may be best to discontinue engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

### Recognize Their Presence as a Person

Value individuals for who they are, rather than for their possessions or achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Avoid questions that focus solely on their job, education, or income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. The goal is to make them feel you care about them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>.

Additionally:
*   **Avoid giving unsolicited advice:** Do not offer advice or lecture people unless they specifically ask for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. Assuming they need your guidance or telling them to change is a significant social error <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Never place yourself above others:** Do not adopt a superior attitude, or offer advice or solutions without being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.
*   **Do not correct trivial facts:** Unless a correction adds meaningful value to the conversation, avoid correcting minor factual errors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. This habit can be detrimental to social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

### Encourage Them to Earn Your Admiration

Give others the chance to strive for your admiration by inviting their input:
*   **Ask for their opinions:** Many people are focused on expressing their own views. Instead, ask others what they think about a topic or situation and genuinely listen to their response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
*   **Listen to their suggestions:** When someone offers advice or a suggestion, listen attentively and don't dismiss them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. For example, if a friend suggests a video topic for your YouTube channel, hear them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. They are often trying to please you and earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>. Even if the idea isn't suitable, respond positively by saying "that seems like a good idea but I need to think about it," rather than outright rejecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Continuous Skill Improvement

Your communication style and ability to interact with people are skills that require continuous practice and improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. The advice to "be yourself" can be detrimental if it prevents self-improvement in areas like social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>. Like any skill, social interactions can be refined and enhanced through conscious effort.

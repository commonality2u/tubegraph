To establish a deep connection with another person, particularly in romantic contexts, it is essential to speak to their emotions rather than their logical mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach is facilitated by a technique known as "listen like a therapist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## From Socially Awkward to Emotionally Connected

Initially, when interacting with women, an individual might be categorized into one of three groups: potential boyfriend, friend, or someone to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The speaker describes a personal journey from being "socially awkward" and "socially inept" due to introversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> to becoming "socially acceptable" by learning [[importance_of_social_skills_for_success | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. However, even with improved general social abilities, the speaker often remained in the "friend" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

The key to moving from the friend zone to a potential romantic partner was the realization that the difference between a boyfriend and a friend lies in emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To be seen as a boyfriend, one must know how to "stir her emotions" and speak to them directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Stirring Emotions: The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

There are two primary ways to stir emotions: either by "entering" feelings into someone or by "bringing them out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Initially, it's not possible to simply insert feelings; rather, the focus should be on prompting the other person to express their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. The moment someone expresses feelings, it "opens the door to her emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This is achieved using the "listen like a therapist" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

This technique involves:
1.  **Asking emotional questions**: These questions prompt the other person to express their feelings, which can include anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, or passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The goal is not just a yes/no or factual answer, but a long, expressive response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. For example, instead of just asking about a job, ask "Do you like this field?" and then "Why?" or "Why not?" to encourage the expression of inner feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
2.  **Listening like a therapist**: Once an emotional question is asked, listen carefully and avoid interrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This allows the person to share their story and feelings, establishing a connection not with their mind, but with their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>.

### From Emotional Questions to Emotional Conversation

An emotional question is merely a key to unlock a larger "emotional conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. After the initial question, and once the person has expressed themselves, the conversation should transition, continuously focusing on letting them talk about emotional things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The importance is in immersing their emotions in the conversation, not the specific topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

A common mistake to avoid is the "interview mode," where one person constantly asks questions without building upon the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Questions should be related and complimentary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. In such conversations, the other person should be talking about 70% of the time, especially in the beginning, while you talk only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This disproportionate sharing helps in [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | building emotional connections in interactions]].

### Examples of Emotional Questions

Social psychology researcher Arthur Aaron developed a list of "36 questions to fall in love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. An experiment with 100 participants showed that asking these questions led to significant attraction, with some even leading to marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. These questions aim to reveal personal details and behaviors related to intimacy, designed to increase closeness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The questions are divided into three sets, with intensity gradually increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Examples from the first set include:
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
4.  What would constitute a "perfect" day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

The crucial point is not to memorize these questions but to understand the concept of what makes a question emotional, enabling you to create your own based on the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The secret is knowing how to transform a regular conversation into an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## The Power of Emotional Connection

A personal anecdote illustrates this: a date, initially set for innocent cuddling, turned sexual after the speaker introduced an MBTI personality test. By asking questions from the test and encouraging elaboration and personal stories, an emotional connection was forged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. For women, sexual desire is triggered by experiencing emotions, especially if the interaction partner is the source of those emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This highlights the importance of creativity in applying these techniques, rather than coming across as robotic or rehearsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

This approach to [[communicating_effectively_to_build_connections | communicating effectively to build connections]] and [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | building emotional connections in interactions]] is not limited to romantic pursuits; it can be applied to build deep and memorable [[importance_of_acquaintances_and_social_connections | social connections]] with anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

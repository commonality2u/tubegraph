Establishing boundaries and maintaining control are crucial aspects of successful dating, allowing individuals to lead and set standards within a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This involves understanding certain female "weaknesses" and using specific strategies to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## The Power of Constructive Criticism

Many men hesitate to criticize women due to a fear of being perceived as rude or impolite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. However, this is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. When a man confidently points out something, even if it seems rude, a woman may admire his confidence and strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

The key is to use criticism thoughtfully, not constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. For example, if an outfit doesn't suit her, tell her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, or if a picture isn't good, say so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This honest criticism has a strong impact because it makes your compliments more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

If you consistently offer compliments, they lose significance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. However, when you criticize occasionally, your compliments become special and desired <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This principle applies universally, as humans tend to value rare things more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. [[dealing_with_rejection_and_criticism_in_dating | Criticism]] acts as a foundation that enhances the value of later praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Strategic Vulnerability: Sharing Weaknesses

Sharing your weaknesses, proactively, can be a powerful technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. If you have a weakness, it's better to tell her about it before she discovers it herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

For instance, if you're not a good dancer, telling her upfront shows confidence and indicates you don't care about her judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This admission also makes her feel empathy for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Empathy is a significant aspect of a woman's nature and can be a "weakness" that makes it difficult for her to say no, leading to strong attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

While using pity to gain attention is not recommended, as it's often a one-time tactic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>, sharing a weakness can cultivate empathy while still maintaining your strength and masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

You can also leverage a woman's natural inclination to care for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. If you're in a relationship and fall sick, asking her to take care of you, such as getting medicine, can strengthen the bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

Additionally, showing moments of spontaneity where you "lose control" a little, like a child wanting a hug, can be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. This reveals an unafraid admiration and can help avoid the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. However, this tactic is best reserved for later stages of dating, not initial meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Making Her Invest: Earning Your Approval

A powerful strategy to [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | build power]] is to make her put in effort to attract you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. This can be achieved by subtly creating a situation where she feels the need to earn your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

For example, mention something you like, such as philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Later, casually ask her if she likes it too <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   If she says yes, she's likely trying to impress you, which is inherent in all women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Her attempt to gain your approval will increase her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
*   If she says no, she will likely overthink it later, wondering about your opinion and whether she lost your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This reflection will make her want you more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

In both scenarios, you win by occupying her thoughts and making her feel the need to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. If she says no and seems indifferent, do not try to convince her or follow her lead; simply ignore it or change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

## Setting Clear Boundaries

[[setting_boundaries_and_avoiding_manipulation | Setting boundaries]] is critical because women are naturally attracted to men who can lead and establish dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This is a "weakness" many people are aware of, but applying it through clear boundaries is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

You need to demonstrate your limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. For example:
*   If you tell her you dislike smoking and she lights a cigarette, immediately get up and walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Over time, she will stop smoking in front of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   If planning a trip, state upfront, "I don't pay for girls; we'll split the costs," and adhere to that boundary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

Regarding who pays the bill, there's no single answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. It depends on your comfort and what works for you, especially in the early stages of dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The most important thing is to do what suits *you* and not worry about her opinion or societal expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. [[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | Maintaining control]] over your actions and preferences solidifies your position.

## Cultivating Options: Not Being Her Only Focus

A common "weakness" among women is their attraction to men who have multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. This dynamic contributes to [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | power dynamics in dating]].

When a girl asks if you're seeing anyone else, instead of feeling insecure and denying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>, respond with something like, "Yes, there are a few candidates I've shortlisted; let's see who gets the job" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This approach not only makes her jealous but also motivates her to work harder to maintain your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

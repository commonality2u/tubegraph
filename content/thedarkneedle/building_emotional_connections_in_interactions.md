To effectively connect with anyone, particularly in initial interactions, a "magic phrase" can be employed to gain extraordinary conversational power, enabling communication with any woman, anytime, anywhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach aims to make the woman want to talk and listen to you, ensuring the conversation is enjoyable and engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.

## Common Mistakes in Introductions

During the introduction phase, men often fall into the trap of appearing uninterested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A common mistake is to immediately bombard women with boring "get to know you" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This not only bores her but also prevents her active engagement in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Such "interview mode" conversations give the woman the power, as the man tries to entertain her while she passively waits for him to make the conversation interesting or leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This question-and-answer format is typically boring for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

## The Golden Rule: Use Statements Instead of Questions

A fundamental rule for engaging conversations is to "use statements instead of questions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. This approach ensures you maintain power in the conversation, making her want to talk to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

When you speak in statements, you can [[creating_positive_emotional_connections_through_dialogue | create feelings of familiarity and comfort]] with someone you've just met, similar to conversations with friends or family that primarily consist of statements, stories, and jokes, rather than an interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Instead of merely requesting information, reframing questions as statements allows you to add substance to the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. This encourages people to open up and share more about themselves without feeling pressured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

### Crafting the "Magic Phrase"

The "magic phrase" is created by turning a question into a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. The statement must be about the woman and include a reasonable and accurate assumption about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

**Formula:** Turn a question into a statement about *her*, including an assumption.

**Example:**
*   Instead of asking "Where are you from?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
*   Say: "You don't seem like you're from here. Are you European?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>

The subject of this statement is the woman herself, which is highly effective because people, especially women, love to talk about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This immediately increases her interest in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. When you make an assumption about her (a "cold read"), it piques her curiosity regardless of whether your assumption is correct or incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. In either case, she starts thinking and wondering about your assumption, further raising her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

**More Examples of Cold Reads:**
*   Instead of "What do you do?" say "You seem like a creative person, I bet you work in design." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   Instead of "Where did you grow up?" say "You don't seem like you grew up around here." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>

Women are interested in hearing opinions about themselves and what led you to your guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This approach makes conversations more engaging and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

## Elevating Interest: Focus on Emotions

While the "magic phrase" sparks initial interest, to truly elevate the conversation and [[creating_emotional_attachment_through_conversation | build emotional connections]], you must introduce emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Connecting with women and [[building_emotional_connections_on_dates | building comfort]] is not about the topic itself, but the feelings behind what you are talking about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

Instead of skimming the surface with basic questions, go deeper and explore her feelings and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Women are emotional beings, so understanding this and exploring their emotions and feelings is key to [[impact_of_emotional_conversations | building an emotional connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

**How to Incorporate Emotions:**
*   **Go Deeper:** Instead of asking which university she attended, ask how she *felt* about her university experience or if it influenced who she is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Explore Relationships:** Instead of asking about siblings, ask about her *relationship* with them and how she feels those relationships shaped her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Focus on Motivation and Impact:** If she's a doctor, instead of asking about hours, ask what *motivates* her to sacrifice for others or how it *feels* to save a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Share Personal Depth:** Ask about achievements or mistakes that evoked strong feelings, or what she would do with one week to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### [[techniques_for_emotional_engagement | Techniques for Emotional Engagement]]

To encourage women to open up, you should [[triggering_emotional_responses_during_conversations | share something deep and personal about yourself first]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Demonstrate leadership by sharing your dreams and aspirations first, and she will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

The goal is to "talk about feelings, not facts" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Look for the emotions underneath the facts and connect those feelings with your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. [[understanding_emotional_states_and_responses | Getting her to open up]] by opening up yourself creates leadership and genuine attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Topics that tend to put women in an emotional state, such as [[emotionally_connecting_through_past_experiences | childhood memories]], travel, and music, are excellent for casual conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. When both individuals are in a highly charged emotional state, connecting becomes significantly easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

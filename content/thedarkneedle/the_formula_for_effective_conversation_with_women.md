To truly succeed with women, you must understand the ultra-rare secret to [[attracting women]] and how to get inside their minds, making them eagerly await your next interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The goal is to make your conversations flow smoothly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Shifting Your Mindset

The first mistake to avoid is overthinking the topic of conversation or how you're going to speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Instead, focus on changing your internal mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>:

-   **She's Just a Human Being**
    Remember that a woman is simply a human being; do not place her on a pedestal, even if she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Internalize this by telling yourself, "she's just a human being" every time you talk to a beautiful girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
-   **See Yourself in a Higher Position**
    Cultivate a perspective where you see yourself as being in a higher position and her in a lower one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This concept will be further explained.

## Understanding Attraction: The Subconscious Radar

Attraction is the single most important and fundamental concept for success with women and dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. Women are emotional beings who are drawn to what they feel, making decisions driven by emotions rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Consequently, they often cannot control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Attraction is a subconscious response women have towards certain behaviors exhibited by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
It's crucial to understand:
1.  Women do not control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  Women do not control who they are not attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

Imagine this subconscious part of a woman's mind as a "radar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When you start talking to her, this radar lights up and scans you to determine your suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This radar operates independently of her conscious mind; if it wants you, her conscious mind won't be able to say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This explains why some women fall for individuals who mistreat them, as their biological programming prioritizes emotional responses over logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

From birth, a woman's primary biological goal is to find the right man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This "right man" is not chosen consciously but sought out and selected by her internal radar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. When talking to a woman, this radar is scanning you, looking for whether you appear to be **better than her** or if she is better than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. If you treat her in a way that shows you see yourself as better than her, her radar will understand this, and she will become attracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

## Body Language to Project Higher Value

Forget traditional body language advice about specific postures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Focus on these three points to signal higher value:

1.  **Lean Away, Not Towards Her**
    Leaning towards a woman subconsciously signals excessive interest, which can be a turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Instead, make it a habit to talk while leaning away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
2.  **Be Willing to Walk Away**
    If she says something you disapprove of, almost start walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For example, if she says "I'm not really interested," respond with, "I know, I'm probably too much for you to handle. You're too much of a nice girl anyway," and begin to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Attractive women are unaccustomed to men walking away, which demonstrates high value and increases attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.
3.  **Be Comfortable**
    The person with higher value in a conversation is the one who sits comfortably and doesn't care about the other person's presence or perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Sit in a position that makes you feel at ease, without worrying about how she perceives you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If you want to put your hands in your pockets, lift your leg, or lean back, do it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. The key is to be comfortable and authentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Stop giving so much importance to body language to impress others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. When you act comfortably and without caring, she will feel that you see yourself as better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## The Conversation Formula for [[Effective communication with women]]

Apply this formula for [[effective communication strategies with women]] during any conversation:

-   **50% about her and her personality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>
-   **30% about the environment or anything else** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
-   **20% about you** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

The reason for this imbalance is that the person who talks excessively about themselves is typically the one who needs the other's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, similar to a job interview where you need the job, not the interviewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Talking About Her (50%)

This involves listening like a therapist, focusing the conversation on her interests, dislikes, childhood, life plans, dreams, and what she sees as positive or negative in herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This approach encourages [[encouraging_women_to_invest_emotionally_in_conversations | emotional investment]].

### Talking About the Environment or Anything Else (30%)

During this phase, do not overthink what to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Talk about anything and everything that comes to mind, as if you're speaking to a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. It's acceptable to say silly things; the important thing is not to appear as if you're trying too hard to be serious or profound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Act as if you're drunk, just keep talking, even if it makes no sense, to avoid appearing as if you're trying to convey a specific idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. If an argument arises, do not get angry or debate to prove your point; remember you don't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. This helps in [[creating_playful_and_fun_interactions_with_women | creating playful and fun interactions with women]].

### Talking About Yourself (20%)

When discussing yourself, **never try to show off** your achievements or adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A golden piece of advice is to always make fun of yourself a little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Tell stories that make you look silly or crazy, not great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This demonstrates that you don't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Being Mysterious

In addition, be mysterious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This does not mean faking your personality, but rather not revealing too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Giving overly detailed answers to questions can unintentionally signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

**Example Responses to Maintain Mystery:**

-   Her: "Where do you work?"
    You: "Hold on there, speedy kitten, we've just met and you're already interviewing me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
-   Her: "What are you doing Saturday night?"
    You: "Something exciting but secret. Sorry, can't tell you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
-   Her: "Have you ever been in a relationship?"
    You: "I don't know you that well yet. I don't discuss private stuff with strangers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
-   Her: "So what's your name?"
    You: "Take a guess. I'll give you a candy if you get it right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

By not revealing too much too early, you create a desire for her to know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Handling Her "Tests"

Even with this formula, women will inevitably put you through "tests" â€“ actions driven by their internal radar to verify if you are genuinely the "real deal" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. These tests often cause men to panic and lose composure, potentially making her doubt your genuineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Strategies for dealing with these tests will be discussed in upcoming episodes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

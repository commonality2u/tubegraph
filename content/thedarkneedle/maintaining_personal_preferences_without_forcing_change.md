When entering a relationship, it is impossible to find someone who perfectly matches all desired qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Instead of searching for an ideal partner based on extensive lists of "red flags" or "green flags," which often prove unfruitful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, a more effective approach involves influencing change in a partner over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. The goal is for a woman to gradually change her personality, thoughts, and behavior to align with your preferences out of her own will, rather than through force or manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Leadership in Relationships
In any relationship, there is a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. For a man, it is essential to [[maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | maintain leadership]] and be in control of the relationship dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This means setting standards for how your partner dresses, acts, and what principles she follows, all while ensuring she genuinely desires to please you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This approach forms part of [[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships]].

## Strategy for Influencing Change
The core strategy for influencing a woman to change without forcing her relies on three main ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>:
1.  Tell her what you want, but don't force it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
2.  Do not need her to do what you want <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
3.  Do not show your need for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### How and When to Communicate Preferences
It's crucial to express your preferences at the right time and in the right way:
*   **Wait for Her to Ask**: Do not immediately state your preferences (e.g., about clothing style) on the first meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Wait until she explicitly asks your opinion or the topic naturally arises in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Justification or Debate**: When you express your preference, simply state it as your taste and step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. Do not engage in arguments or try to logically convince her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Maintain Your Stance**: No matter the pressure or attempts to change your mind, do not alter your stated opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Changing your opinion signals a loss of [[maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | leadership]] from her perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a> and can lead to a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Not Forcing the Change
When communicating a preference, express it in a cold and indifferent manner, not as a major issue or a condition for the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For example, avoid saying, "If you don't change your dressing style, we can't be together" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Simply share what you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

### Not Showing Need or Attachment
The final step is to demonstrate that you do not *need* her to change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. If she doesn't immediately change after you've expressed your preference, do not talk about it or give it any attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. By not bringing it up, you signal that you don't *need* the change to happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. This strategy encourages her to question why you haven't mentioned it, eventually leading her to make the desired change willingly as her attachment to you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This principle is key to [[building_power_and_maintaining_autonomy_in_relationships | building power and maintaining autonomy in relationships]].

## Maintaining Your Own Standards
It is crucial never to change your own thoughts or yourself for the sake of a girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Doing so undermines your [[maintaining_leadership_in_relationships | leadership]] position and leads to a loss of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This helps in [[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | maintaining control and standards in relationships]].

## True Red Flags to Avoid
While some "red flags" (like having male friends) can be addressed through the above strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, there are certain traits that are genuine red flags, indicating a girl you should distance yourself from, as they are unlikely to change and will cause suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:

*   **Flirting with Other Men**: If a girl flirts with other men in your presence, she is likely seeking attention or trying to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This behavior typically leads to drama and will not cease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Never show jealousy, as that validates her goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Attachment to Her Ex**: If a girl is still emotionally attached to her ex, she carries heavy emotional baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Suggest she give her ex another chance, showing your willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This helps avoid a "drama queen" who will constantly bring up her past relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **Energy-Sucking Women**: These women are characterized by deep insecurity and an insatiable need for validation, which can never be satisfied no matter how much attention you give them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. They may use sex as a tool for emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a> and often have low self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, leading to drama and [[setting_boundaries_and_avoiding_manipulation | manipulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. It is vital to assess a woman's personality deeply before committing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. This is part of [[mindset_adjustments_to_avoid_seeking_validation | mindset adjustments to avoid seeking validation]].

## Understanding When a Woman Mentions Other Men
When a woman mentions other men, it generally indicates one of two reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>:
1.  **To Show Her Desirability**: If she talks about other men asking her out or complimenting her, she is likely trying to impress you and signal that she is desired, hoping you will ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. This is not necessarily a bad sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
2.  **To Friend-Zone You**: If she discusses her past breakups, how much she loved an ex, or how she wants him back, she is likely trying to offload emotional baggage onto you and place you in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. In this scenario, it is best to walk away immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. This relates to [[overcoming_predictability_in_relationships | overcoming predictability in relationships]] and [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintaining attraction and mystery in relationships]].

By understanding these dynamics and maintaining your personal preferences without forcing change, you can cultivate healthier relationships and avoid unnecessary drama.

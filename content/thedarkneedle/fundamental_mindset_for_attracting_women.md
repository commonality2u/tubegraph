## The Instinctual Nature of Attraction

Contrary to the belief that "women are different and each one of them is unique," attraction is largely an instinctual process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Just as a thirsty person instinctively needs water regardless of their background, physical attraction to a "beautiful body and a pretty face" is an uncontrollable, instinctual male response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Similarly, for women, attraction is primarily emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. If a man can trigger the right emotions in a woman, she will be attracted to him, regardless of his physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. All women fundamentally desire the same thing in a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This understanding is key to the [[psychology_of_attracting_women | psychology of attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Core Mindset for Attraction

The right mindset is the foundation for attracting women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Belief in Deservingness
A man must believe he deserves anything that exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This means not telling yourself you don't deserve a certain job or that a girl is "too beautiful" or "out of your league" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This belief is a significant sign of strength that draws women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Intrinsic Value and Boundaries
A man must not allow his value to be diminished or disrespected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. If someone disrespects or insults you, you must stop them and set boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. A woman's attraction to a man increases significantly when she sees him standing up for himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This applies even if the woman herself disrespects you; boundaries must be set <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Confidence in Decisions
Whenever a decision is made, it should be assumed to be the correct one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This mindset exudes confidence, which is highly attractive to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. A man should not hesitate in his choices, whether it's choosing a path, ordering food, or buying clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Decisions should be made with certainty, without seeking approval or input from the woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Assumption of Mutual Attraction
Always assume that a girl you are attracted to is also attracted to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This is a fundamental principle for entering the dating world and should be communicated through your demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Key Behaviors for Attraction

Beyond mindset, certain behaviors are essential for [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

### Having a Plan and a Goal in Life
This is a crucial trait for [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Women are not primarily impressed by simply having money or a good job; they are drawn to ambition and a man working towards a goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. A man actively striving for a dream, such as a medical student working hard, is more attractive than someone who has already achieved their goal, like a practicing doctor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

Even if you are stable, you must always have a goal you are actively working on, whether it's training for a physique or a side hustle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. A woman needs to feel that you are heading somewhere and she is joining you on that journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Without a goal, a woman can quickly become the center of your world, leading to undesirable dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

To demonstrate this, make your goal more important than her at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. For example, prioritize work or workouts over immediate meet-ups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Always stay busy with something meaningful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. This continuous striving is vital for maintaining a woman's attraction, even in marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Sometimes, a woman might test your commitment to your goal; you must not let her discourage you, but also avoid anger, as it's a natural test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### The Ability to Ask for What You Want
This is a highly attractive trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. When ordering food, in a taxi, or at work, clearly state what you want without asking others for their opinion or hesitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. Do not underestimate these small actions, as they significantly impact attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Even if a request is denied (e.g., a taxi driver refusing to open a window), it's not an issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The important thing is that you asked for what you wanted without embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This applies to all desires, from small conveniences to asking for a raise at work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### The Ability to Handle Failure
This trait is deeply ingrained in human nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Women are drawn to a man who can overcome failure, fall, and rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This ability has a magical effect, creating intense attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

To demonstrate this:
*   **Express failure without discouragement**: If you fail a job interview, talk about it, but immediately apply to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Face mistakes**: If you make a mistake in a relationship, don't back down. Face the issue, talk, and work to resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The concept of "makeup sex" exists because women are attracted to men who face challenges and solve problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Never remain stuck**: Do not give up at the first sign of failure, whether it's an injury stopping your workout or a failed exam leading you to quit studying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Pick yourself up and rise again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   **Don't be ashamed of failure**: Failure is a part of life, not a flaw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Showing you can handle failure makes a woman feel safe and attached, believing you can overcome challenges in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

### Not Being in a Rush
In a relationship, never appear hurried or overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Women are attracted to men who are composed, deliberate, and patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Avoid immediately asking to meet after getting a phone number or meeting the very next day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

The quality of interaction matters more than the quantity of time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Five minutes of high-energy, exciting interaction is far better than five hours of boring conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. The key is to always trigger her emotions and make conversations emotional and engaging, not just ordinary talk lacking energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

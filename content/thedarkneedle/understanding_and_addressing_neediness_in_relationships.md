Being consistently ignored by women or constantly [[logical_vs_emotional_chasing_in_relationships | chasing girls]] indicates a significant problem in one's life [00:00:13]. This issue is not resolved by financial status, physical appearance, or merely focusing on self-improvement like working out [00:00:20]. Even becoming a millionaire while being ignored by women will only attract individuals seeking financial exploitation [00:00:46]. The core of this problem lies in one's behavior and the way one interacts with women [00:01:23].

## The Problem: Neediness

The primary reason women tend to ignore men is **neediness** [00:01:48].

Neediness is not about verbally expressing a need for someone [00:03:45]. Instead, it is something a woman senses when a man makes excessive effort solely to impress her [00:03:47]. When a man makes an effort, it signals that he "needs" that woman, which is the foundation of neediness [00:03:24].

**How Neediness Manifests:**
When a man is attracted to a woman, his brain tends to make him "make an effort" to impress her [00:02:12]. This can involve:
*   Agreeing with her preferences (e.g., liking the beach because she does) [00:02:17].
*   Buying things for her (e.g., a book she likes) [00:02:23].
*   Adjusting posture, speech, or appearance to seem "special" [00:02:41].
*   Stepping out of one's [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | natural state]] to appeal to her [00:02:28].

The moment a woman perceives this effort, she automatically begins to ignore the man [00:04:10]. Conversely, a man being his natural self around a woman he doesn't "need" can lead her to like him [00:04:15].

## Overcoming Neediness and Being Ignored

To stop being ignored, one must not be needy, which means ceasing to make excessive effort, and instead, remaining in one's [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | natural state]] [00:04:00]. This approach involves making her feel that you don't need her [00:04:22].

Manipulative tactics like ignoring texts or being late on purpose are generally ineffective and often noticed by women [00:04:35]. The true solution lies in a fundamental shift in behavior.

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion or Society's Standards

The focus should be on enjoying one's time with a woman without caring about the outcome or whether she approves [00:07:29]. Be detached from the outcome [00:07:31].

**Examples of Natural, Non-Needy Behavior:**
*   **Playful Teasing:** Gently tapping her head with a plastic bottle and saying "Shh" when she banters or jokes, in a playful, not aggressive, manner [00:05:01]. This demonstrates not caring about her opinion and enjoying oneself [00:05:21].
*   **Patting Her Head:** Playfully patting her head and saying "Good girl" after she does a small favor or something you like, treating her like a "little kid" [00:06:08].
*   **Joking About Flaws/Mistakes:** If she mentions a low exam score, laugh and say "you're so stupid" instead of offering sympathy [00:06:39]. If she falls, laugh and ask how it happened (in appropriate, non-serious situations) [00:06:46].
*   **Maintaining Personal Habits:** If you smoke and she complains, simply state you'll finish your current cigarette rather than immediately moving away or extinguishing it [00:07:04]. Let her adjust her distance if she is uncomfortable [00:07:20].

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself

Maintain your usual lifestyle and comfort levels when with a woman, especially on early dates [00:08:03].

*   **Date Locations:** Go to places you would naturally go with a friend, rather than expensive restaurants [00:08:06]. Parks and free places can be ideal for dates [00:08:14].
*   **Familiarity:** For first dates, choose a place where staff know you (e.g., a regular cafe) [00:08:29]. This communicates that she is an addition to your existing life, not the reason for a complete change in it [00:08:36].
*   **Appearance:** Dress normally and simply, avoiding extravagant clothes or excessive grooming (e.g., spending an hour on hair) [00:08:45]. Comfort reflects a lack of effort to impress [00:09:07].
*   **Authenticity about Flaws:** Don't hide or try to prove yourself when she criticizes an ability (e.g., not knowing how to drive) [00:09:15]. Laugh and acknowledge it, then continue the conversation [00:09:28]. Be honest about what you don't know and don't be ashamed of your flaws [00:09:33].
*   **Resist Meeting Standards:** If she states a preference (e.g., "I like guys who go to the gym" or "I like men who don't wear glasses"), don't try to meet her standards [00:09:41]. Instead, joke about it, perhaps saying "You've got great taste" or "Yeah, I like guys like that, too" and laugh [00:09:59].

### 3. Never Compete Over Her

Avoid situations where you are competing with other men for a woman's attention or approval [00:10:07]. Competing signifies neediness, insecurity, and effort to impress [00:10:40].

*   **Maintain Calmness:** In a group setting, stay calm and natural [00:10:54]. Don't try to tell a better joke, appear stronger, or tell a more exciting story than other men [00:10:48].
*   **Elevate Other Men's Value:** Appreciate and enjoy the company of other men [00:12:02]. Laugh at their jokes [00:12:06], don't try to one-up their stories [00:12:08], and highlight their value if they do something impressive [00:12:10]. Women notice when a man genuinely appreciates others instead of trying to be the sole standout [00:12:13].
*   **Avoid Jealousy:** If you see a woman you like with another man, do not ask her about him or try to know details [00:12:32].
*   **Confidence in Introduction:** If you are dating or in a relationship with a woman, consider introducing her to a friend who is "better looking" than you [00:12:44]. This demonstrates high [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | confidence]] and a complete lack of jealousy [00:12:55]. Never show fear that he might take her from you [00:13:00].

### 4. Body Language Reflects Comfort

Your body language should naturally reflect comfort, not a deliberate attempt to project a certain image [00:13:11].

*   **Relaxed Posture:** Sit in whatever position is comfortable for you, whether hands are in pockets, on your head, or stretching out [00:13:23]. Disregard online advice about specific postures [00:13:18].
*   **Natural Movement:** Walk and move in a way that feels comfortable to you [00:13:42]. Avoid overly deliberate movements [00:13:35].

By applying these behaviors, a woman will perceive that you are someone who doesn't need her [00:13:56]. This approach means you haven't put in effort or chased her, therefore, you never give her the chance to ignore you in the first place [00:14:01].

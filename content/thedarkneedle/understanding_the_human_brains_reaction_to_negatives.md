The human brain is fundamentally wired to react more strongly to negative stimuli than to positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. This is because the brain is programmed to prioritize running away from danger over seeking something good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## The Negative Bias Explained
Consider a smoker who is told by a doctor that if they smoke again, their heart will stop beating; they will likely stop smoking immediately. However, if the doctor tells them that quitting smoking will maintain their health, it's less likely they will stop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This illustrates that our brain responds more powerfully to potential harm than to potential benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Application in [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | Attraction]]
While finding common interests can help break the ice in social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, a more effective and faster way to create strong attraction is by identifying something both individuals dislike or hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This method leverages the brain's strong reaction to negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Shared Hatred as a Bonding Mechanism
Historically, a common enemy has been one of the most powerful ways to build alliances and attract people to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This shared hatred can manifest in various forms:

*   **Common Enemy/Dislike**: This could be a shared disdain for things like social media's superficiality or how dating apps have made relationships difficult and meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
    *   **Question to Ask**: To discover this, one of the best questions to ask is: "What is the thing you hate the most? Who is your enemy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. If you share the same dislike, express it passionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
*   **Common Hated Person**: People tend to bond more over individuals they dislike than those they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If two people share a dislike for the same person (e.g., a boss, teacher, or annoying customer), it can quickly forge a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
    *   Even if you don't share the same dislike, listening to her passionate and emotional explanation of why she hates someone can save a lot of time in building connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **"Partners in Crime" Dynamic**: Creating an "us against them" or "You and Me Against the World" dynamic can foster connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This might involve secretly pranking co-workers, having inside jokes about certain customers, or collectively complaining about a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Simple Dislikes**: This can be as straightforward as disliking the same food, finding a particular city boring, or agreeing that a certain TV show or movie is terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

By using the instinct of bonding through negative emotions, individuals can leverage this fundamental aspect of human psychology to their advantage in social interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. The other fastest way to attract someone is by making them laugh, a topic related to [[psychology_behind_laughter_and_attraction | humor and attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

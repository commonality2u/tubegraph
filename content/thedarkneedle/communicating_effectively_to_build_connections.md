Achieving success and fostering strong relationships hinges on highly developed [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. These skills are often identified as the single common attribute among successful individuals, including CEOs, company executives, and world leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. In fact, some sources suggest that [[impact_of_communication_skills_on_building_relationships | communication skills]] can account for as much as 85% of one's life success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Even endeavors like starting a YouTube channel heavily rely on strong [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Core Human Instinct: Hunger for Value

A fundamental principle underlying all [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] is the inherent human instinct for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. People possess a deep desire to feel valuable within their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. By skillfully satisfying this "hunger for value" in others, one can win them over and influence them positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. For example, a math tutor motivated a "slow" but hardworking student by praising his work ethic, leading the student to dramatically improve and strive to impress the tutor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This act of positive manipulation, feeding the student's need for value, was key to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

## [[effective_communication_strategies | Strategies for Making Others Feel Valued]]

To effectively feed this instinct, it's crucial to understand the proper techniques for giving value to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

### Making Them Feel They Influenced You

A golden rule in [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] is that to leave an impression and influence someone, you should make them feel as though *they* are the one who left an impression and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Instead of trying to show how amazing you are, demonstrate that you perceive *them* as amazing and remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Focused Conversation

One primary way to achieve this is through focused conversation, where the dialogue revolves around the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. There are two methods for this:

1.  **Letting Them Talk About Themselves:** When someone shares an experience, keep the focus on them by asking follow-up questions like "Oh, and what did you do about it?" or "How did the date go?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Avoid shifting the conversation back to your own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Active listening is essential here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
2.  **Redirecting General Topics Towards Them:** If a conversation starts on a general topic (like the weather), redirect it to ask about their personal preferences or opinions, such as "What do you like more: rain or sunshine, summer or winter?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This gives them value and an opportunity to earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Handling Interruptions and Asserting Yourself

When someone interrupts you in a conversation, a powerful display of strength is to generally ignore it, letting them talk and change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This shows you don't need to prove anything, which in turn makes them feel the need to prove themselves to you, increasing your value in their eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

However, if someone *constantly* interrupts, you should calmly and directly tell them, "Why don't you let me finish what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. As a man, society expects clear and direct self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If they continue interrupting despite this, it's acceptable to disengage from the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Recognizing Their Presence as a Person

To build genuine [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | connections]], accept and value people for who they are, not for their job, possessions, or achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

*   **Avoid Status-Based Questions:** Refrain from asking questions about their job, education, or income, as this can make them feel valued only for what they do or own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Avoid Unsolicited Advice and Lecturing:** Do not give advice or lecture people unless they explicitly ask for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. People generally know their problems and don't need unsolicited instruction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Avoid Correcting Minor Facts:** Unless it's crucial to the conversation, don't correct trivial factual errors made by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This habit can be detrimental to social interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Encouraging Admiration

To encourage others to strive for your admiration, integrate these [[techniques_for_effective_communication_in_relationships | techniques]]:

*   **Asking for Their Opinion:** People often focus on expressing their own opinions. Stand out by consistently asking for others' opinions on topics and genuinely listening to their responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Listening to Their Suggestions:** When someone offers advice or suggestions, listen attentively instead of rejecting them outright <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Even if an idea isn't feasible, acknowledge it gracefully (e.g., "That seems like a good idea, but I need to think about it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. They often offer suggestions because they want to please you and earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Never Looking Down on Others:** A critical rule is to never treat anyone as if they are unintelligent or inferior to you, regardless of their education or age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Treat everyone as an equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Developing Social Skills: It's a Skill, Not Just "Being Yourself"

The common advice "be yourself" can be misleading and unhelpful for developing [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Just as someone trying to quit smoking or lose weight wouldn't be told to "stay true to yourself," [[effective_communication_and_expression_techniques in relationships | communication]] is a skill that requires practice and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Developing these skills is an ongoing process that yields significant rewards in all aspects of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

To make a girl think about you constantly, it's crucial to cultivate uncertainty and defy her expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A key component of this strategy is avoiding being overly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Creating Space for Her to Think
The fastest way to a girl's heart is by making her think about you for a prolonged period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. To achieve this, it's essential not to always be available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. This means:
*   **Don't immediately respond to messages** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Don't be constantly present** every time she reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
*   **Give her space between interactions**. For instance, if you went out today, wait a week before suggesting another outing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Similarly, if you talk today, don't necessarily talk tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

A common misconception is that if you don't talk often, she will forget you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. However, for a girl to develop feelings, she needs time to think about you, and most of this time should be spent apart from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Attraction builds when you are not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

A crucial piece of advice is: "A girl will forget you if you're afraid she'll forget you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. In the modern world, where social media and dating apps often make men overly available, you stand out by not being afraid to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. She will forget everyone except the person who isn't afraid of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Defying Expectations
Always being the opposite of her expectations is vital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. You should never let a girl completely predict your actions or fully understand you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. When she starts thinking about you due to your uncertainty, she will try to anticipate your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Whatever she expects, do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This keeps her thinking about you in an "endless loop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

The human mind tends to expect repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. For example, if you call her every day, she will expect that pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. To maintain intrigue:
*   If you went out three times this week, next week, go out once or not at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   If you've been messaging daily, stop for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   If you always laugh with her, sometimes meet her without laughing at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This approach ensures you keep her guessing and feeling puzzled, unable to figure you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Avoiding Mirroring and Predictable Games
[[avoiding_being_boring_and_predictable_with_women | Being predictable]] can be detrimental. For instance, mirroring her response times in messaging is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This hands all control to her and is not genuine; women are perceptive and will notice such games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Instead, vary your response times: sometimes respond right away, sometimes take your time, and other times, don't reply at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This variation makes you appear less interested and harder to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

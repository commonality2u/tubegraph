In the realm of relationships, men have three choices: be the "nice guy," the "bad boy," or the "half bad half nice" individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The "nice guy" often ends up in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, while the "bad boy" might make women chase him but experiences frequent breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The "half bad half nice" man can make a woman fall deeply in love, constantly thinking about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This concept is crucial for [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintaining attraction and mystery in relationships]].

## The "Half Bad Half Nice" Principle

Our brains naturally focus on exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. If you are consistently kind or "white," a small mistake, like a "black dot," will stand out and be remembered, leading to resentment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Conversely, a person who is not naturally kind but occasionally does something good will be praised and seen as great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This human nature dictates that respect is not gained by constant service or kindness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It's more effective to be a "black page" with occasional "white spots" rather than a "white page" with occasional "black spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

When applied to women, being constantly nice means your kindness won't be seen as special or appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, if you behave normally or indifferently and occasionally do something nice, these gestures will stand out and create [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This is the core difference between the "nice guy" (always white, occasional black dot) and the "half bad half nice" man (black, occasional white dot) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. For clarity, this "half bad half nice" individual will be referred to as "the gentleman" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

A woman's brain perceives a man who isn't overly nice, but rather behaves normally or indifferently, as a "high value man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This is because his lack of constant niceness is interpreted as confidence and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When such a man does something nice, it's seen as an exception and is highly valued, increasing her love and [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This aligns with [[understanding_attraction_as_a_skill | understanding attraction as a skill]].

To be a high-value man without being overly nice, yet still a gentleman, two fundamental points must be understood: attention and requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. These are key [[strategies_for_effective_communication_and_maintaining_attraction_in_dating | strategies for effective communication and maintaining attraction in dating]].

## Attention

There are misconceptions about how women receive attention: they don't love endless attention, nor should you completely ignore them for [[creating_attraction_through_uncertainty | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For short-term interactions, avoiding attention might work, but for long-term, healthy, and stable relationships, a modified approach is needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The rule is not to give attention *all the time* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. There must be a balance between giving and withholding attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Whenever you give attention, you must stop afterward to prevent it from losing its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

The decision to give or withhold attention depends on the type and origin of emotions involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Here are five main possibilities:

*   **Woman feels negative emotions because of *you*** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>:
    *   **Example**: She feels jealous because you talked to another woman, or she's angry/crying because of your mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Action**: Give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **You feel negative emotions because of *her*** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>:
    *   **Example**: She talks to another guy, posts a picture with another man, or does something you dislike (e.g., smoking) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
    *   **Action**: Do *not* give her attention. Do not show anger or being affected. Ignore the situation completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. If she messages you, reply normally without extra attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This is part of [[psychological_strategies_to_enhance_attraction | psychological strategies to enhance attraction]].
*   **Woman feels positive emotions because of *you*** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>:
    *   **Example**: You took her to a nice place or did something that made her happy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
    *   **Action**: Do *not* give her too much attention afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. If you took her to an expensive dinner, don't text her all night or ask if she got home safely; just disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. This prevents her from taking continuous attention for granted.
*   **You feel positive emotions because of *her*** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>:
    *   **Example**: She wears an attractive outfit, does something you enjoy in bed, or buys you a gift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
    *   **Action**: Give her attention, it is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Woman feels emotions (positive or negative) but *not because of you*** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>:
    *   **Example**: She's in a bad mood due to work or family issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   **Action**: Remain neutral and do *not* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Buying flowers or taking her out to cheer her up in such situations is a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. If she's your girlfriend, listen and talk kindly, but avoid excessive attention or overdoing help to prevent being put in the "therapy zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Women experience a wide range of daily emotions, and constantly chasing her when she's down is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

By applying this pattern, most of the time you will remain neutral, occasionally giving attention, which increases her [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Requests

Handling a woman's requests involves knowing when to accept and when to refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Requests can be either tests to gauge your strength or genuine desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Direct Orders (Tests)

Women often use direct orders as tests, especially in early interactions, to see if you are accustomed to being around attractive women and won't immediately follow orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

*   **Requests that inconvenience you or make no sense**:
    *   **Example**: "Go buy me something" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
    *   **Action**: You must refuse. Simply laugh and say "no" calmly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Requests that don't bother you but are still direct orders**:
    *   **Example**: "Give me a kiss on the cheek" or "Take our picture" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Action**: Do not outright refuse, but also do not accept directly. Instead, accept on *your own terms* by taking control and setting conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. For instance, if she says "Take our picture," you can respond, "Okay, but I want you to give me your best silly sexy gangster face, ready, go!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Or, if she says "Wait for me here," respond, "Cool, I can wait, but I'm actually going to be over there. Come find me when you get back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This subtly shifts the power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Indirect Expressions of Feelings (Genuine Requests)

Women often express desires indirectly by mentioning things they like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. Instead of saying, "I want to go to the beach," she might say, "I love the beach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

*   **Action**: The answer is to **delay** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. If she mentions loving burritos, don't immediately take her for one. Instead, surprise her with a burrito a few weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   By delaying, you show thoughtfulness and that you listened, but you avoid appearing overly eager, submissive, or weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   This also makes you unpredictable, which women appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   Note what she likes, but fulfill her wishes at unexpected moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>. Show strength and don't submit to her whims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Be kind but firm, making it clear that whining won't get her what she wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Over time, she will learn that she gets what she wants when *you* decide to give it to her, not when she demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This approach contributes to [[handling_rejection_and_maintaining_confidence | handling rejection and maintaining confidence]] in relationship dynamics.

By understanding these principles of attention and requests, a man can be nice without losing his masculinity, effectively navigating [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | emotional dynamics to maintain attraction]] and [[maintaining_attraction_and_mystery_in_relationships | maintaining attraction and mystery in relationships]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

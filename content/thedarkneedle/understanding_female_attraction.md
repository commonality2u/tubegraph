Attracting women is a skill, not something dependent on appearance or financial status. Personal struggles with dating and girls often stem from a lack of knowledge about how to [[understanding_male_and_female_attraction | attract a woman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Your current single status should not be taken personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Debunking Common Misconceptions

Social media often promotes the idea that physical attributes (like height or a beard) or wealth are necessary for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. However, many men who are not particularly good-looking or financially stable successfully attract beautiful women, simply by understanding [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | female psychology]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. The [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | way a woman is attracted to a man]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> has evolved over millions of years and has little to do with modern societal ideals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. To [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | create attraction in a woman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>, a man needs to understand these underlying factors and [[understanding_womens_psychology | how women think]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Playing in Your Own Field

In the dating market, a woman's "currency" is often considered sex, while a man's "currency" is commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. When interacting with a woman, there are two potential directions for the interaction: sex or a long-term relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. As a man, you are the one who chooses this direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

*   **Sex Field:** If the goal is sex or a one-night stand, the woman becomes the "prize" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Commitment Field:** If the goal is commitment or a long-term relationship, **you, as the man, are the prize** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

It is generally easier for a man to succeed in the commitment field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. While sexual desire is natural and shared by women, it should not be your primary goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Be Sexual, Not Horny

*   **Sexual:** Being sexually comfortable, unashamed of the topic, and finding it normal and fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.
*   **Horny:** Being sexually needy, aggressively seeking sex, having an agenda, and being dependent on a specific outcome from the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

Never appear desperate for sex, as this automatically places you in the sex field, making her the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. A woman will not pursue a man if she feels she is the prize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### You Are The Prize

To internalize that you are the prize:
If you give a woman your attention and approval too easily, she will not [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | value you]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A common mistake is showering an attractive woman with excessive attention, leading her to [[misconceptions_about_women_and_attraction | take you for granted]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This includes:
*   Immediately telling her she's beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   Agreeing with everything she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   Complimenting her excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.
*   Giving her disproportionate attention compared to other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

Just as a man is not automatically entitled to a woman's body, women are not automatically entitled to your attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Give your time and energy only to a girl who invests her own time and energy in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This selective investment makes you valuable and worth pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Avoiding the Friend Zone

The idea that you must be a good friend before becoming a lover, often portrayed in romantic movies, is a misconception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. In reality, once you are in the friend zone, a woman will likely never see you as a potential romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. She will treat you like a platonic male friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, and any attempt to initiate a romantic move may cause her to pull away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Compliments

Many men mistakenly believe that showering a girl with compliments will impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. However, compliments often make you seem like just another guy seeking sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Attractive women live in a state of abundance when it comes to male options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. They are constantly approached and receive compliments from many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Therefore, telling her she's beautiful is not new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Instead, she will likely categorize you as just another guy trying to get with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, especially given that [[understanding_womens_attraction_to_men_with_options | women with many options]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Understanding Women as Emotional Beings

When interacting with a woman in a dating or relationship context, it's crucial to understand that she does not primarily think with logic; she reacts based on her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   **Do not rely on logic:** The specific words you say matter less than the emotions your words evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Do not justify actions:** If a woman makes a statement about you (e.g., "you're skinny"), responding with a logical justification (e.g., "I'm working out to gain weight") will decrease her attraction because you are speaking to her rational mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Attraction is instinctual:** [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | Attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a> is an emotional and instinctual response, not a conscious choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

### Subcommunication: The "Bad Boy" Paradox

When a man brags about his achievements, he might think he's showing high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. However, women subconsciously perceive this as insecurity and inadequacy, signaling that he feels the need to prove his worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. This explains why [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | women are often strongly attracted to "Bad Boys"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   **Nice Guys:** When a "nice guy" spoils a woman with gifts and expensive dates, he believes he's demonstrating his ability to care for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. However, this often leads to the exact opposite of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Bad Boys:** A "bad boy" who acts with arrogance, dominance, or unpredictability subconsciously communicates higher value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Subconscious Perception:** Women perceive him as confident, holding high status, emotionally independent, and not needing to please her, making her feel lucky to have his attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This makes him appear as a high-value man, leading to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

You don't need to be a "bad boy" to be attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. You can be respectful and kind while still being highly attractive by understanding this instinct and [[understanding_womens_psychology | female nature]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. [[understanding_womens_psychology | Understanding women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a> is not complicated; they are emotional beings operating on a set of instinctual rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Once these rules are understood, you can [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | understand any woman]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

If you are single or have not had fulfilling relationships, the problem is not with you or with women, but simply with your actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Changing your behavior based on these principles can lead to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

Engaging someone emotionally is presented as a crucial skill, particularly in romantic interactions, to move beyond being just a friend and become a potential partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. The core principle is to speak to a person's emotions rather than their logical mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach is also applicable for creating deep and memorable connections with people in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

Women are said to experience sexual desire when they begin feeling emotions, especially if the speaker is the source of those emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## Stirring Emotions

There are two primary ways to stir emotions and feelings:
1.  **Entering feelings into a person**: This method is generally not effective at the beginning of an interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
2.  **Bringing feelings out of a person**: This is achieved by encouraging them to express their existing feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. The moment someone expresses feelings, it opens the door to their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

This technique is identified as the quickest way to engage someone's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. It involves asking "emotional questions" and listening intently to the answers, similar to how a therapist would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

### What are Emotional Questions?

Emotional questions are designed to make the other person talk in an emotional way, prompting them to express their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. These feelings can range from anger, sadness, hatred, and admiration to passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The goal is not just to gather facts, but to elicit deeper, feeling-based responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

**Conditions for Emotional Questions:**
1.  **Elicits Expression of Feelings**: The question must encourage the person to express their inner emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Instead of "What do you study?", ask "Why do you like/dislike this field?" This prompts personal feelings rather than just factual information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Example**: Instead of a simple "New York is beautiful," ask "How can you live in a city like that? Do you like New York?" This invites an emotional response about their experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
2.  **Prompts a Long, Expressive Answer**: The answer should be detailed and allow the person to elaborate on their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. If a short answer is given, follow up with "why?" to encourage more depth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### The Conversation Flow

Once an emotional question is asked and the person begins to express themselves and share their story, the next step is to transform this into an [[creating_emotional_attachment_through_conversation | emotional conversation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

1.  **Listen Carefully and Do Not Interrupt**: Allow the person to express themselves as much as possible without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This shifts the communication from the mind to the emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Transition Between Topics Emotionally**: As the conversation progresses, identify emotional points within their story and ask follow-up questions that delve deeper into those feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. The focus should always be on getting them to talk about emotional things, immersing their emotions in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>.
3.  **Avoid "Interview Mode"**: Do not simply ask a string of unrelated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Questions should be connected, with one thought complementing another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
4.  **Balance Talking Time**: In a conversation, especially initially, the other person should be talking approximately 70% of the time, while you talk only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.

### The 36 Questions to Fall in Love

Social psychology researcher Arthur Aaron developed a list of 36 questions designed to increase intimacy and foster attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. In an experiment, pairs of strangers who asked each other these questions experienced significant attraction, with some even marrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. These questions are structured in three sets of 12, with intensity gradually increasing to reveal personal details and intimate behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>.

**Examples of the first 10 questions:**
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>

The key is not to memorize these questions but to understand the underlying concept of how to turn a regular conversation into an [[creating_emotional_attachment_through_conversation | emotional one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

## Creativity and Avoiding the "Therapy Zone"

While these techniques are powerful, it's important to be creative in their application <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a>. Simply asking questions robotically can make you seem unauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. Relying solely on this technique without integrating other social skills might lead to being perceived only as a "therapist," rather than a romantic interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.

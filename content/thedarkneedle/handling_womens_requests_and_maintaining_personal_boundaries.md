In life, when dealing with women, a man has three choices: be a "nice guy," be a "bad boy," or be "half bad, half nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The "nice guy" often fails with women and gets [[setting_boundaries_in_relationships | friend-zoned]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The "bad boy" makes women chase but experiences many breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The ideal approach is to be "half bad, half nice," making women fall deeply in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This article explains how to achieve this balance without falling into the "nice guy" trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding Human Nature and Perception

Our brains naturally pay attention to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This applies to all social relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:

*   **The "White Page" (Always Nice):** If you are always kind and never refuse requests, a single mistake will make people see you as a bad person, overshadowing all the good you've done <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Your consistent kindness becomes the "white background," and any mistake is a "black dot" that they remember <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. You will never gain [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | people's respect]] by simply serving them or always [[being_assertive_and_setting_boundaries | being kind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **The "Black Page" (Occasionally Nice):** Conversely, someone who is not naturally kind but occasionally does a good deed will be widely praised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. It's better to be the "black page that occasionally shows white spots" than the "white page that occasionally shows black spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These are the rules of the game for earning appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

### Applying to Women: The "Gentleman"

If you are always nice to a woman, she will not see your kindness as special or appreciate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. However, if you behave normally or indifferently and *occasionally* do something nice, these gestures will stand out and attract her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

*   **Nice Guy:** Always "white," with occasional "black dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Gentleman (Half Bad Half Nice):** "Black," with occasional "white dots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

When you are not naturally nice but behave normally or indifferently, a woman perceives you as a high-value man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Your lack of constant niceness is interpreted as [[balancing_confidence_and_interest_in_understanding_women | confidence]] and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When you then do something nice, it's an exception, and she will focus on it, remembering it for a long time, increasing her love and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

To be a high-value man who is not overly nice yet still a gentleman, focus on two fundamental points: Attention and Requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Principles of Attention

There's a misconception that women love a lot of attention; this is wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Another half-truth is that you should never give attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. For long-term, healthy relationships, you must modify this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>: you should not give attention *all the time* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Your decision to give a woman attention depends on the type of emotions involved and how they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

1.  **Woman feels negative emotions *because of you*** (e.g., jealousy from talking to another woman, anger/crying due to your mistake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>:
    *   You **should** give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

2.  **You feel negative emotions *because of her*** (e.g., she talks to another guy, posts an undesirable picture) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>:
    *   You **must not** give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
    *   Do not show anger or affectation; ignore completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   Do not shower her with compliments or love, as this shows jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
    *   Reply normally if she messages, but do not give extra attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

3.  **Woman feels positive emotions *because of you*** (e.g., you took her somewhere nice, did something to make her happy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>:
    *   You **should not** give her too much attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
    *   [!WARNING] Never give continuous attention; there must be a balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. After giving attention, stop giving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Overdoing it loses its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If you take her to an expensive dinner, don't text her afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Just disappear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

4.  **You feel positive emotions *because of her*** (e.g., she wears an attractive outfit, does something you enjoy, buys a gift) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>:
    *   You **should** give her attention; it is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

5.  **Woman feels positive or negative emotions *not because of you*** (e.g., bad mood from work, family issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>:
    *   You **should remain neutral** and not give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   [!WARNING] Do not buy her flowers or try to cheer her up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. If you do, she will place you in the "therapy zone" and constantly turn to you for emotional support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   If she is your girlfriend, listen and talk kindly, but do not give excessive attention or overdo helping her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
    *   By applying this pattern, you will remain neutral most of the time, giving attention only occasionally, which increases her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Handling Requests and [[importance_of_confrontation_and_setting_boundaries | Maintaining Standards]]

When a woman asks you for something, there are two types of requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>:

1.  **Requests as a Test/Direct Order:** These are designed to see if you are strong or easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Women use these, especially in early interactions, to gauge if you're used to being around attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
    *   **If the request is inconvenient or makes no sense** (e.g., "Go buy me something") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>:
        *   You **must refuse** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. You can calmly laugh and say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   **If the request doesn't bother you but is still a test** (e.g., "Give me a kiss on the cheek," "Take our picture") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>:
        *   Do not outright refuse, but **do not accept directly** either <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
        *   [!INFO] Accept on your own terms by taking control and setting your own conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This subtly shifts the power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
        *   *Example:* If she says, "Take our picture," respond with, "Okay, but I want you to give me your best silly, sexy gangster face, ready, go!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.
        *   *Example:* If she says, "Wait for me here," respond with, "Cool, I can wait, but I'm actually going to be over there. Come find me when you get back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

2.  **Requests as Indirect Expressions of Feelings:** Women often mention things they like instead of making a direct request (e.g., "I love the beach," instead of "I want to go to the beach") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
    *   **Do not immediately act** on these <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   [!INFO] **Delay** fulfilling the wish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
    *   *Example:* If she mentions loving burritos, don't take her immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Surprise her with a burrito a few weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
    *   Delaying shows thoughtfulness and that you listen, but you completely avoid appearing overly eager, submissive, or weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. It also makes you unpredictable, which women love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   [[setting_boundaries_and_maintaining_standards_in_dating | Be kind but firm]], making it clear you don't have time for whining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. She will learn that she gets what she wants when *you* decide, rather than when she demands it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

By applying these principles of attention and request handling, you can be nice without losing your masculinity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

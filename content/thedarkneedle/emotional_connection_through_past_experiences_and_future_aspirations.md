For a woman to become attached, certain emotions must be planted within her, including missing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Women are [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional beings]], and they enjoy moments when they feel strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. When a conversation or date is ending, making her feel something strong right before you stop talking will cause her mind to go into confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. When you leave, she will continue thinking about you without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Evoking Emotions for Deeper Connection

One method to foster this [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotional connection]] is by triggering emotions related to her past or future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### Relating to the Past: Experiences

The best way to evoke emotions tied to the past is by discussing experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Experiences, whether from childhood, travel, or career changes, are deeply linked to emotions and often lead to amazing stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

You can initiate this by asking:
*   "What made you move to this city?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>
*   "What's the biggest adventure you've been on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
*   "What's the most exciting place you've visited?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>

To deepen the [[using_empathy_and_understanding_to_build_connections | connection]], dive into the emotions behind these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Ask questions like:
*   "How did it feel when you did the blah blah blah?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>
*   "What was your feeling during that moment?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>

Even if you haven't had identical experiences, you can relate by sharing different experiences that triggered similar emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. For example, if she felt anxious about a risky career change, you can relate with anxiety from moving to another country or starting a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This allows for [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotional connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.

> [!caution]
> Do not talk endlessly about your own experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Briefly relate your experience, then shift the focus back to her to show you understand and are genuinely interested in her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Relating to the Future: Aspirations

Evoking emotions related to the future is best done by discussing her aspirations, goals, dreams, and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Many people rarely get to talk about their dreams because few ask about them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

When you encourage her to open up about her aspirations, you stimulate a range of positive and hopeful emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. These emotions will automatically be associated with you in her subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

To open this topic, you can ask:
*   "What are your biggest goals?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   "What are some things you've always wanted to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   "What are you aiming to achieve this year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

To deepen the conversation, ask questions about her feelings:
*   "How would you feel if you did that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
*   "What would your life look like if you accomplished that dream?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>

## Application

When a conversation or date is nearing its end, or you are about to leave, initiate a discussion about her past experiences that triggered strong emotions, or her future aspirations and dreams that bring excitement and hope <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This approach makes her think about you after the conversation ends and gives her a reason to miss you when you're not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

The speaker notes a common pattern where initial interest from a girl wanes over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. After years of experience and research into the psychology of women, a solution was identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The first step in addressing any problem is to identify its cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Reasons for a Girl Losing Interest

Two main reasons contribute to a girl losing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

### 1. Lack of "Drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>

"Drama" is an emotional process a girl must go through to feel attracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. To maintain her long-term attraction, she needs to experience a variety of emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>:

*   **Excitement**: Achieved by mixing interest and disinterest in conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Fun**: Show you are an enjoyable person, so she associates you with exciting and fun moments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.
*   **Confusion**: Create it by leaving stories unfinished or ending meetings without revealing your feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Curiosity**: Confusion naturally leads to her being curious about your interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
*   **Eagerness**: Make her eager to learn more by keeping her guessing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
*   **Jealousy**: She should know you have other options and that she needs to compete for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.
*   **Comfort**: A girl will not become physically close unless she feels comfortable around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Do everything to trigger this feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Conflict**: Don't be afraid to engage in small arguments occasionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

A good mix of these emotions is key; letting one dominate will lead to boredom and loss of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. To trigger these emotions, remain unpredictable and mysterious in conversations, behavior, and self-expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### 2. She Feels You Want Her More Than She Wants You <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>

When a girl senses you desire her more, she begins to pull away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This is evident through actions that reflect a fear of losing her, such as:

*   Doing everything she asks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   Going out of your way to please her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   Saying phrases like "My life has no meaning without you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

While these expressions might be intended to convey importance and love, excessive effort to please her will not make her feel the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Solutions: Assessing and Acting on the Situation

The approach depends on your current status with the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Recently Met (Hunting Phase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>

If you've only met once or twice, you are in the "hunting phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. As a man, you must take the initiative to approach her and make the first move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Once attracted, she will start to pursue and invest her effort in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

*   **Example**: If she didn't respond to a message, wait, then comment on her story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Example**: If she works with you and doesn't talk one day, take the initiative to start the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

It's natural to start the conversation yourself in the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. It's rare for a girl to show strong interest from the first meeting, as they are constantly approached by many men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Even possessing ideal traits doesn't prevent her from losing interest over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Girl Showed Interest, Then Lost It <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

This scenario is the primary focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. It occurs when she has shown interest, you've met multiple times, and everything seemed fine, but then she suddenly stops communicating or showing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This stage is challenging and requires following seven essential steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>:

1.  **Do Not Overcommunicate**: When she stops communicating, avoid excessive talking, repeated messages, multiple calls, or constantly trying to initiate conversations to find out why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This behavior reveals a fear of losing her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Never let her see that you feel she no longer wants you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
2.  **Do Not Confess Your Feelings**: When she distances herself, there's pressure to express feelings to win her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, she likely distanced herself because she felt you liked her *too much* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. Confessing feelings in this situation is a major mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The only time to confess feelings is when she confesses her love for you after a long relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
3.  **Do Not Express Your Anger**: If she doesn't reply or answer calls, do not block her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. This only shows she emotionally affected you and confirms your attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Similarly, do not send messages like "Why didn't you reply?" or "I'm tired of you and your games" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Even if you feel anger, do not show it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>; don't insult her or block her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
4.  **Do Not Apologize (in the Wrong Way)**: Men tend to be logical and try to fix problems rationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. When she stops communicating, avoid apologizing for your actions (e.g., explaining why you missed a date or didn't reply) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. She interprets apologies as fear of her disinterest and sees you as weak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
5.  **Don't Jump Directly to the Final Solution**: Avoid confronting her directly with statements like, "I want you, tell me if you want me or not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This shows she has affected you and caused pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. In this phase, you must be comfortable staying in the "gray area" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a> (though being direct is fine in other scenarios, like the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>).
6.  **Don't Give Her Gifts, Offer Money, or Take Her to Expensive Restaurants**: Never make this mistake when she is distancing herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. She will perceive it as you trying to buy her love, which will push her further away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Gifts are appropriate for occasions like birthdays, not to win her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
7.  **Don't Doubt Yourself**: When a girl loses interest, avoid self-doubt (e.g., "Am I unattractive?," "Do I have a weak personality?") and don't devalue yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Her attraction, or lack thereof, is not about you as a person or your personality; it's about your actions and behavior, which can always be changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Golden Advice: Give Her Space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>

When a girl loses interest and distances herself, the most crucial action is to give her space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Stay calm and composed, and maintain distance; don't talk to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

*   When she sees you've given her space and followed the steps outlined, she will likely come back and reach out to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   **When She Returns**: Do not immediately invite her on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Doing so implies you were waiting for her, undermining the composure you displayed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. Instead, talk to her casually and reignite her emotions as previously explained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Only ask her for a date after a certain period has passed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

There is also a possibility that her actions were a form of [[manipulation_strategies_in_communication | manipulation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

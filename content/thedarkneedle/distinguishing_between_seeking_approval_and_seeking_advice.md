Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose the woman herself and to lose yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One common mistake that prevents a man from gaining a woman's respect is failing to distinguish between [[approvalseeking_behavior_in_relationships | seeking approval]] and seeking advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Women's Nature Regarding Help and Support

A woman is a being who loves to help and enjoys the idea of offering help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. One of the strongest ways for her to bond emotionally with someone is through giving support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Asking a girl for advice is one of the fastest ways to create a connection with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Problem: Confusing Advice with Approval
Most men fall into the trap of asking for advice in a way that makes them appear as if they are actually [[avoiding_approval_seeking_behavior | seeking approval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. It is easy to cross the line between genuinely seeking an opinion and seeking reassurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

> "Many men don't actually ask to hear her opinion. They ask to be reassured that they're making the right decision." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>

When a man makes decisions through the filter of "how will she react?" or "will this upset you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, he is no longer basing his decisions on his own values and principles, but on fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This is something women notice very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

### Consequences of Seeking Approval
Once a man's decisions are based on pleasing her, she becomes the center of his life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. While she might not say anything and may even pretend everything is normal, her respect for him starts to diminish the moment she perceives that he needs her approval to be himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

Furthermore, by trying so hard not to upset her, a man becomes easier to manipulate and more predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. Women, consciously or unconsciously, will test this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Maintaining Your Leadership and Respect
When asking for a woman's opinion on something you plan to do, do not ask because you are afraid of her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Ask because you genuinely want her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Decisions Related to Your Own Life
Decisions related to your personal life, such as wanting to travel or go out with friends, should not be based on her happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. You should not ask for her opinion or wait for her approval for these matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Decisions Involving Both of You
When decisions involve both of you, the difference between a leader and a follower becomes apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. For example, if you suggest going to the movies and she suggests going to the pool, and you concede to her preference, you lose your leadership and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Instead, you should:
1.  **Refuse her alternative**: Politely state your preference (e.g., "I want to go to the movies") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
2.  **Maintain your stance**: If she persists, respectfully tell her you don't want to do her suggestion, but she is free to go alone if she wishes, while you pursue your original plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

By consistently doing this, she will eventually stop opposing you and start accepting your leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. Her emotions should not control your life or dictate your desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. A woman wants you to be the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

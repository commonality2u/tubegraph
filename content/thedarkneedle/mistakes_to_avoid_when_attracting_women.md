To make a woman think about you constantly and foster attraction, it's crucial to understand and avoid common [[mistakes men make while interacting with women | mistakes]] that provide her with too much certainty, thereby ending her intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Women are scientifically attracted to men whose emotions are somewhat mysterious, which creates uncertainty and leads to them thinking about you, ultimately fostering love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>.

Her subconscious primary goal is to find certainty regarding your feelings: Do you want her? How interested are you? Who likes the other more? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a> If you don't provide these answers, you maintain her intrigue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## Do Not Compliment Her
Avoid complimenting a woman, especially during the early stages of getting to know and attracting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. If a woman is attractive, her ego is likely high, often assuming interest from any interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. While it's not problematic if she knows you're interested, she shouldn't know if you *actually* want her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Instead, talk normally without giving compliments like "you're beautiful" or "your eyes are gorgeous" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Do Not Ask for a Date Immediately
After a good time or meeting, avoid expressing wishes to go out again, such as "we should go out again" or "I had a great time, we should do this again sometime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:00">[03:01:00]</a>. Such statements give her certainty, ending her intrigue, and she won't think about you much afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. If you leave without mentioning a next time, she'll wonder if you enjoyed it or want to see her again, causing her to analyze the meeting and reflect on her impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. Similarly, in the beginning stages of texting, never ask for a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

## Do Not Ask Her for Anything
Avoid requesting anything that shows you need her or her affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. This includes:
*   Asking for her Instagram or social media accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   Asking for a hug or a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a>.
*   Asking her to call you or questioning why she hasn't replied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.

Many men constantly seek a woman's approval and affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. When you don't ask for anything, you stand out, making her question your interest and wonder about you, keeping you on her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a> Live your life and make her feel like she's just a minor character in it.

Be smart; don't be overly cold or completely indifferent, as this gives her the certainty she's seeking (a clear "no") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Do Not Always Be Available
Do not always be available, respond to her messages immediately, or be there every time she reaches out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. If you went out today, wait a week before suggesting another outing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>. If you talk today, skip talking tomorrow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Avoid clinging to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

It is a [[misconceptions_about_women_and_attraction | misconception]] that she will forget you if you don't talk to her often <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>. For a girl to develop feelings, she needs time, most of which should be spent *apart* from you, allowing her to think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Attraction builds when you're not around, giving her space to wonder and reflect on you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:00">[05:50:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a> A girl will forget you if you're afraid she'll forget you.

In the modern world, many men are always available, clinging to attractive women because they fear being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. The woman will forget these men, but not the one who isn't afraid of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>.

## Resist the Urge to Give Certainty
You will feel internal pressure to provide certainty, such as wanting to compliment her, suggest meeting again, ask for something, be available, or worry about her forgetting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. Cultivate a sense of adventure, resist these urges, and control yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>. This approach also teaches self-control beneficial in all areas of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.

## Avoid Being Predictable
[[avoiding_being_boring_and_predictable_with_women | Never let a girl predict your actions or understand you completely]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>. When she thinks about you, she'll try to predict your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. Whatever she expects you to do, do the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. This keeps her thinking about you in an endless loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

The human mind expects repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>. If you call every day, she'll expect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. If you maintain a pattern, she'll expect that pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. Therefore, always do the opposite of what you usually do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>:
*   If you went out three times this week, don't go out at all or just once next week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.
*   If you've been messaging every day, stop for a while <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
*   If you always laugh with her, try sometimes to meet without laughing at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

Keep her guessing and feeling puzzled, unable to figure you out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>.

## Avoid Naive "Games"
Do not engage in naive [[mistakes_in_flirting | games]] like mirroring her response times in messages, believing it maintains your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. This is a huge mistake because it hands all control to her, and women are perceptive enough to see through such insincere behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

Instead, vary your response times: sometimes reply immediately, sometimes take your time, and other times don't reply at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Do what feels right for you without worrying about her reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. By constantly changing things up, you appear less interested and make it impossible for her to predict your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>.

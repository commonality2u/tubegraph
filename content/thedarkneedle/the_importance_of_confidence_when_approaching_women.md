When approaching women, certain actions are crucial to success, while others should be avoided [00:00:01]. Even a charming individual like Brad Pitt will fail if they make common mistakes that stem from a lack of [[The role of confidence in attraction | confidence]] [00:00:08]. The core idea is that a man's demeanor and internal state significantly influence the outcome of interactions [00:03:19].

## The Pitfalls of Lacking Confidence: A Case Study

A young man in a park repeatedly failed to approach an attractive woman he saw [00:00:17]. Initially, he hesitated due to negative thoughts, freezing until she left [00:00:28]. This pattern of being "paralyzed with fear" and "frozen in place" continued for days, preventing any successful [[Approaching women in public | approach]] [00:00:53].

When he finally managed to approach, his nervousness caused him to fumble for words, leading to an awkward and brief conversation [00:01:11]. His anxiety persisted in subsequent attempts, resulting in short, stilted interactions where he struggled to maintain her interest [00:01:46].

This lack of [[Confidence in social interactions | confidence]] escalated over time, leading to:
*   **Increased Attachment and Insecurity**: He became overly attached, consumed by whether she liked him, with his emotions swinging wildly based on her attention [00:02:07].
*   **Premature Confession**: Driven by confusion and insecurity, he confessed his feelings too early, leading to the woman seeing him "only as a friend" and eventually distancing herself [00:02:25].
*   **Desperate Pursuit**: Despite clear rejections, he continued to pursue her, reinforcing the "friend" dynamic until she completely withdrew [00:02:49].

This man demonstrated several "low value male" traits that sabotaged his chances [00:03:21].

## Common Mistakes Stemming from a Lack of Confidence

### 1. Putting Her on a Pedestal
The young man put the woman on a pedestal solely based on her looks [00:03:32].
*   **High-Value Male Trait**: High-value males do not overemphasize a woman's appearance. They value personality over looks, understanding that good looks are common, but a good personality is rare [00:03:34].
*   **Impact**: When you act this way, you are perceived as "that special, different guy," which is what many women seek in a potential mate [00:03:53]. Conversely, over-emphasizing looks signals a lack of [[Building confidence when approaching women | confidence]] in your own value beyond her physical appearance.

### 2. Excessive Agreement and Seeking Approval
The young man agreed with her too much, trying to keep her comfortable, which gave off a "weak vibe" [00:04:02].
*   **Impact**: Constantly agreeing implies you are seeking her approval or permission, communicating that you don't know how to get the recognition you deserve [00:04:17]. This also suggests you don't consider yourself "good enough" and fear losing her [00:04:30].
*   **The Trap of "Nice Guy" Behavior**: Many average guys, fearing they'll "screw it all up," resort to asking boring questions and agreeing with everything to avoid being seen as rude [00:04:41]. This leads to dull conversations and the woman quickly disengaging [00:04:58].
*   **What Women Want**: Women desire a challenge [00:05:17]. You will never be a challenge if you agree with them on everything [00:05:19].
*   **Solution**: To avoid seeking approval, let her do most of the talking and make the conversation about her, not yourself [00:06:05].

### 3. Making Intentions Clear Too Early
The young man made it clear that he "wanted" the woman from the beginning and was the first to confess his feelings [00:06:15].
*   **Impact**: When you reveal your true feelings too early, the woman might feel she has "conquered" you, and the tension and [[The role of confidence in attraction | attraction]] you've built can dissipate [00:06:29]. You become "too easy to get" [00:06:43].
*   **Maintaining Attraction**: Since [[The role of confidence in attraction | attraction]] is not something women can consciously control, it can die if they feel they have "gotten" you [00:06:45].
*   **Solution**: Keep her guessing about your true feelings. This ambiguity maintains attraction and intrigue [00:06:54].

### 4. Trying to Solve Her Problems
The young man tried to solve the woman's problems, which is a quick way to end up in the "friend zone" [00:07:06].
*   **Impact**: Solving her problems places you in the "provider zone," akin to a "big brother" figure [00:07:21]. This subconsciously communicates low value, making you someone she turns to in trouble but never a potential lover [00:07:32].
*   **Misconception**: Men often feel like "real men" when they come to a woman's rescue [00:07:46]. However, in her perception, you become "just another nice guy trying to give a helping hand" [00:07:48].
*   **What Women Want**: Women typically discuss issues to be heard, not to seek solutions [00:07:53]. They simply want a good listener [00:07:57].
*   **Solution**: Listen to her problems, but don't try to solve them for her [00:07:27].

### 5. Acting Too Disinterested
While it's important not to chase, acting completely disinterested can be perceived as rude [00:08:06].
*   **The Balance**: The correct approach is to show a *bit* of interest followed by a *bit* of disinterest, never complete disinterest [00:08:22].
*   **Example**: Saying "You look cute in this dress, but pink would have been better" shows both active interest and a slight hint of disinterest [00:08:44].
*   **Avoid Rude Disinterest**: Directly insulting her, like "This dress isn't looking good on you, you should have tried pink," comes across as highly rude [00:09:01].

### 6. Discussing Your Problems or Insecurities
Sharing your issues or insecurities with women is a great way to kill attraction [00:09:14].
*   **Expectation**: Women want to see you overcome problems, not just discuss them [00:09:22].
*   **Impact**: Sharing your problems or insecurities (e.g., past failures, struggles) indirectly tells her you aren't strong enough to deal with them yourself, implying you need her help or sympathy [00:09:27]. This gives a "dull impression" and is a direct [[The role of confidence in attraction | attraction]] killer [00:09:43].
*   **Exception**: You can mention weaknesses if you're laughing and making fun of yourself in a humorous way, which shows you don't care about her opinion [00:09:50].

### 7. Always Giving a Direct "Yes"
Never be too easy for a woman [00:10:04]. Constantly saying "yes" to her requests, even when you might want to say no, indicates a lack of control [00:10:07].
*   **Solution**: Make her work a little to get a "yes" from you [00:10:14]. Set conditions before agreeing, or let her request you more [00:10:26].
*   **Context Matters**: This strategy applies to "random requests," not important or urgent ones, such as if she needs medical help [00:10:32].

### 8. Getting Mad or Upset
If you get angry or upset over a girl's actions, it signals that you are not in control and she controls you [00:10:47].
*   **Maintaining Control**: If her actions can make you react, she is driving the interaction [00:10:53].
*   **Tests**: Girls might say "nasty things" to test your reaction in extreme situations [00:10:59]. Reacting as she predicted means you fail the test [00:11:12].
*   **Solution**: Be "like a rock in the storm" and act as if nothing gets to you, no matter what [00:11:04]. This demonstrates inner strength and [[Body language and selfconfidence in attracting women | self-confidence]].

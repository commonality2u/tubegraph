Attracting women involves understanding both verbal and nonverbal communication, with a significant emphasis on internal mindset and [[body_language_and_comfort_in_social_situations | body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. The core principle revolves around how a woman's subconscious mind evaluates a man during interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>.

## Mindset for Attraction

A fundamental aspect of attraction is the internal mindset a man adopts when interacting with a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.
*   **See her as a human being**: Avoid placing attractive women on a pedestal. They are simply human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Perceive yourself as being in a higher position**: While this may sound counterintuitive, adopting a mindset where you see yourself in a slightly superior position can influence how she perceives you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:02">[00:54:02]</a>.
*   **Understand female attraction**: Women are primarily emotional beings, making decisions driven by feelings rather than logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:02">[01:14:02]</a>. Attraction is a subconscious response to specific behaviors exhibited by men, and women cannot consciously control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:06">[01:48:06]</a>.
*   **The "Radar"**: Imagine a woman's subconscious mind as a radar that scans you during a conversation to determine suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. If this radar accepts you, her conscious mind may not be able to say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:06">[02:24:06]</a>. This radar seeks a man who appears better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

## Key Body Language Principles

Forget conventional advice about posture and specific gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>. Instead, focus on these three core points:

1.  **Lean Away**: Avoid leaning towards a woman, as this can subconsciously signal over-interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. Instead, make it a habit to lean away when talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>.
2.  **Be Willing to Walk Away**: If a woman expresses disapproval or disinterest, consider almost walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. For example, if she says she's not interested, respond with something like, "I know, I'm probably too much for you to handle, you're too much of a nice girl anyway," and then start to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>. This demonstrates high value and will often make her try to stop you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>.
3.  **Prioritize Comfort and Ease**: The most crucial aspect of body language is to be completely comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. The person with higher value in an interaction is the one who sits comfortably and doesn't outwardly care about the other person's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
    *   Sit in a position that makes you feel at ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.
    *   Don't overthink how you should sit or move your hands/legs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
    *   The woman cares whether you are comfortable, not about specific gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.
    *   Apply this mindset universally: do what makes you comfortable, and don't seek to impress others with your [[adjusting_mood_and_posture_to_influence_others | body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. When you are comfortable and don't care what she thinks, she will perceive you as being better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

## Effective Conversation Structure

For [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | effective conversation techniques with women]], follow this formula:

*   **50% about her**: Focus on her personality, likes, dislikes, childhood, dreams, and what she views as positive or negative about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. The person who talks excessively about themselves is often seen as needing approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>.
*   **30% about the environment or anything else**: Talk about whatever comes to mind, even if it's silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. The goal is to avoid appearing as though you're trying too hard to say something profound or serious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>. Maintain a relaxed, conversational flow as if speaking to a long-time friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>. Do not get angry or debate to prove a point; you don't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   **20% about you**: When discussing yourself, avoid boasting about achievements or adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Instead, tell stories that make you seem silly or crazy, not amazing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This demonstrates that you don't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

## Maintain Mystery

In your self-presentation, include an element of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. This does not mean faking your personality, but rather not revealing too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>. Giving overly detailed answers signals low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. By withholding information, you create curiosity and make her want to know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:01:00">[10:01:00]</a>.

### Examples of Mysterious Responses:

*   **Her**: "What are you doing Saturday night?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>
*   **You**: "Something exciting but secret, sorry, can't tell you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>
*   **Her**: "Have you ever been in a relationship?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>
*   **You**: "I don't know you that well yet. I don't discuss private stuff with strangers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>
*   **Her**: "So, what's your name?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>
*   **You**: "Take a guess. I'll give you a candy if you get it right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>

Even with these techniques, women may "test" you to see if you are genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>. Remaining composed during these tests is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

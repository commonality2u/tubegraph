In any [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]], there is inherently a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This principle applies to friendships and romantic partnerships alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. In a romantic [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]], the man should ideally be the leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This [[importance_of_leadership_in_relationships | importance of leadership in relationships]] means being in control and guiding the [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]]'s direction, encouraging the woman to align her personality, thoughts, and behaviors with your desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

## Guiding Principles for Leadership

Effective [[building_power_in_relationships | building power in relationships]] in a [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]] involves encouraging a woman to want to please you of her own free will, rather than through force, control, or manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

The correct strategy for influencing a woman's behavior and dealing with "red flags" can be summarized in three core ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>:
1.  **Tell her what you want** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.
2.  **Do not force it on her** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Do not show your need for her to change** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.

### 1. Communicate Your Preferences (When Asked)

It's crucial to express your preferences only when prompted by the woman, not on the first meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. For example, if you dislike certain clothing styles, wait for her to ask about your preferences, as she likely will over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>.

When she asks, state your taste directly and step back; do not justify your opinion or engage in debate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. Maintain your opinion consistently, even if she pressures you to change your mind, as changing your stance can undermine your [[importance_of_leadership_in_relationships | leadership]] and her [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | attraction]] to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

### 2. Avoid Forcing the Change

When expressing your preferences, do so in a "cold and indifferent manner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. Avoid framing it as a major issue or a condition for the [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]]'s continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Simply share what you like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>.

### 3. Do Not Show Need or Attachment

Do not convey that you *need* her to change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. If she doesn't change immediately after you state your opinion, do not bring it up or give it any attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>. By not reacting, you demonstrate that her change isn't essential for your well-being, which paradoxically increases the likelihood that she will eventually adjust her behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. This strategy works across various aspects, such as a woman having male friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.

## Undermining Leadership: Traits to Avoid in a Partner

Some traits indicate a woman who cannot or will not align with your [[importance_of_leadership_in_relationships | leadership]] and can lead to suffering in a [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>:

*   **Flirting with other men**: This behavior is often a bid for attention or an attempt to evoke jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Such women thrive on external validation and drama, making a stable [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]] difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. Crucially, do not show jealousy, as it plays into her goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   **Attachment to an ex-partner**: A woman who frequently talks about her ex or has not moved on from past [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationships]] carries heavy emotional baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. Suggest she explore rekindling that past [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]] if her attachment persists, demonstrating your [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | power dynamics and respect in romantic relationships]] and willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **"Energy sucking" women**: These women are often deeply insecure, constantly seeking validation but never feeling satisfied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. They may use sex for emotional needs that can never be fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. They often have low self-esteem, are prone to drama, and may resort to manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. It is essential to discern these [[contrasting_personalities_in_relationships | contrasting personalities in relationships]] early and disengage for your emotional well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

### Understanding Mentions of Other Men

When a woman mentions other men, it usually falls into two categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>:
1.  **To convey she is desired**: If she recounts stories of men approaching her or complimenting her, she is likely trying to impress you and indicate her desirability, hoping you will ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.
2.  **To "friend zone" you**: If she discusses deep emotional attachment to an ex, how much she loved him, or strategies to win him back, she is attempting to offload emotional baggage and position you as a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. This is a clear sign she is not the right partner for a romantic [[dynamics_of_romantic_relationships | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>.

When trying to understand [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] and relationships, a common phrase encountered is "if a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the type of respect that fosters [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | love]] and [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] is distinct from ordinary respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. It's not about setting boundaries or general politeness, but a deeper respect that grows over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.

## Types of Respect

There are two primary types of respect a woman might feel:

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>: This is the respect one feels for a kind, elderly family member or a platonic friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It often leads to being "friend-zoned" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  **Emperor-like Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>: This is the respect felt for a powerful, inspiring, and impressive individual, akin to how one might respect a Roman Emperor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This type of respect is what leads to [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Attractive respect is achieved when a woman *wants* to respect you, rather than you trying to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This respect is built upon two core elements: **power** and **fear** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Element 1: Power

Power in a relationship context means maintaining your independence and self-worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

### Maintaining Your Identity

Your life, including your friends, hobbies, and interests, should remain consistent after meeting a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While you can try new things, it should be for your own reasons, not to appease her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. A woman may unconsciously test you by trying to make you change your style, habits, or even friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. If you succumb to these tests, you lose your power and, consequently, her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Your opinions should also remain firm and not change simply because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Avoid arguing aggressively; instead, calmly assert your boundaries with actions, not justifications or debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> Never sacrifice your happiness or interests for a woman, as this can lead to being placed in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. A woman should never be the reason for your change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Strategic Apologies

Avoid apologizing unnecessarily, especially for trivial matters or when you've done nothing wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

Consider the following scenarios when deciding whether and how to apologize:

1.  **You did nothing wrong, but she's upset**: Do not apologize. Instead, tease her a little and joke around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
2.  **You made a small mistake (in an established relationship)**: Apologize briefly, then give her space. Do not beg for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Let her come back to you naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
3.  **You made a big mistake (serious and unforgivable)**: In this rare case, it's acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, such as buying a gift or visiting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Responding When She Is At Fault

1.  **Small transgression/words**: Do not show anger or drama; remain indifferent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
2.  **Medium mistake**: Hold her accountable without anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. For example, if she cancels a date last minute, tell her she's "messing up her chances" and hang up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If she calls back, set a clear consequence like writing an apology letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If she refuses, end the interaction and don't contact her again unless she contacts you first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
3.  **Big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: Do not get angry, but end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Forgiving her in such a situation will permanently diminish her respect for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> Never let her actions make you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Your reaction indicates whether you are in control or if she controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. Remain calm and unresponsive to nasty remarks or extreme situations, as these are often tests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Reacting predictably means failing the test and losing power and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

## Element 2: Fear (Enjoyable Fear of Loss)

The second key component of attraction-generating respect is a subtle, enjoyable fear of losing you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This concept is rooted in the principle: **Investment = Attraction = Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

A common mistake men make is believing that their investment in a woman (e.g., expensive dates, gifts) will win her over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This often leads to the friend zone while she pursues someone who invests less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> It's **her investment in you** that truly matters, not your investment in her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The more time, effort, and money she spends on *you*, the more [[encouraging_women_to_invest_emotionally_in_conversations | attached]] she becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Conversely, if she isn't investing, her feelings will remain unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.

To increase her investment and thus her [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] and [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | desire]], you need to reverse the dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. You should invest just enough to make her comfortable investing in you, then allow her to take the lead in investing her time, effort, and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

As she invests more in you, her fear of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This is a natural human tendency: the more we invest in something, the more we fear its loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. This subtle "fear of loss" is the second crucial component of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

When the elements of **power** (derived from your self-control and unwavering identity) and **fear** (driven by her increasing investment in you) are both present, a woman will genuinely respect you and be less likely to show disrespect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

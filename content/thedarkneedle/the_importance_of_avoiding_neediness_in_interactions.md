If you consistently find yourself ignored by women or constantly chasing them, it indicates a significant problem in your life that isn't solved by financial status or physical appearance alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. Even if you become wealthy, if you are currently being ignored, the women attracted to you may only seek to exploit you financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The fundamental issue lies in your behavior and the way you interact with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Changing your behavior is essential to resolve this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

## Understanding Neediness

When you like someone, you tend to make an effort to impress them, such as agreeing with their interests or buying gifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. This effort causes you to step out of your natural state, becoming alert and trying to adjust your posture, speech, or appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Humans typically make an effort when they *need* something, like preparing food when hungry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. Similarly, making excessive effort for a girl signals that you *need* her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

The "number one killer of attraction" is [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | neediness]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Neediness isn't expressed verbally; it's a feeling a girl perceives when she sees you making an effort solely to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This perception of neediness is precisely why she starts ignoring you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

To avoid being ignored, you must not be needy, which means you must stop making unnecessary efforts and instead remain in your natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. The moment a girl senses you've deviated from your natural self, she will instinctively begin to ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is why you often find yourself liked by girls you don't pursue, as you are simply being yourself around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

It's crucial to discard common, often manipulative, online advice like delaying replies or intentionally being late for dates, as these are not genuine solutions and are often recognized by women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Strategies for Avoiding Neediness

To project that you don't need a girl and to remain natural around her, adopt the following behaviors:

### Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion

Your focus should be on enjoying your time without concern for the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This involves being detached from whether she approves of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Playful Teasing**: Engage in playful, lighthearted actions that you would normally do with a close friend, such as gently tapping her head with a water bottle and saying "Sh" when she jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This demonstrates that you are being yourself and don't care about her judgment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Casual Authority**: If a girl does a small favor, humorously pat her head and say "Good girl" as if she were a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Do what comes to mind without overthinking her standards or thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   **Humorous Responses to Flaws**: If she shares a setback, like a low exam score or falling down, respond playfully rather than overly solicitously (e.g., "You're so stupid!" or laughing at her) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This shows you're enjoying yourself without needing her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. However, ensure the situation is appropriate for joking and avoid being rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
*   **Maintain Your Habits**: If you smoke and she complains, state you'll finish your cigarette or say something simple and continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Why should you be the one to change? Let her adjust if she's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Don't Overextend Yourself

Avoid making special efforts to impress her in your lifestyle choices:

*   **Date Appropriately**: Don't take her to an expensive restaurant if it's not typical for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Choose places you would visit with a friend, especially for early dates, as this demonstrates you don't need to make special efforts for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Taking her to places where you are known (e.g., a regular cafe) conveys that she is an addition to your existing life, not a reason to change it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Authentic Appearance**: Don't dress excessively or spend an hour preparing for a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Dress normally and simply, prioritizing your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This conveys relaxation and a lack of effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Embrace Imperfections**: If she criticizes your abilities or mentions traits she likes (e.g., going to the gym, not wearing glasses), don't try to prove her wrong or meet her standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Instead, laugh, agree lightheartedly, or turn it into a joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Be open about your flaws and don't try to fake abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Never Compete for Her

Avoid situations where you are competing with other men for a girl's attention, as this signals insecurity and neediness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

*   **Stay Calm**: In a group setting, do not try to tell a better joke or boast to stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Remain calm and natural, as if no girls are present, and simply enjoy the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Elevate Other Men**: One of the most powerful ways to impress girls is to highlight the value of other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. If someone tells a joke, laugh heartily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. If another guy shares an impressive story, don't try to one-up him; instead, applaud and acknowledge his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Girls notice when a man doesn't compete and instead projects [[importance_of_confidence and selfworth in relationships | confidence]] and doesn't need anyone's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jealousy**: If you see a girl you like with another guy, do not ask about him or seek details; simply ignore it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Introduce Her to Friends**: Introduce her to a friend who might even be better looking than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This demonstrates high [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | self-confidence]] and a lack of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### Body Language

Your [[importance_of_nonreactivity_in_relationships | body language]] should naturally reflect comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Disregard rigid online advice about specific postures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Instead, sit, stand, and move in any way that feels comfortable to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. This authentic comfort will be picked up by the girl's subconscious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>.

Always remember that while you may like a girl, you do not *need* her, and you will not make any effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. By applying these behaviors, she will perceive you as someone who doesn't need her, and you will no longer be ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

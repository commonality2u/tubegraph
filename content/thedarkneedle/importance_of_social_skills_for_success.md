[[social_skills_and_emotional_intelligence | Social skills]] are presented as the "key to all the people on this planet" and, by extension, the key to life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. It is argued that these skills are the most crucial for success in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Social Skills as a Universal Trait of Leaders
Upon examining CEOs, company executives, and world leaders, a common thread emerges: despite possessing diverse individual skills, they all share strong [[social_skills_and_emotional_intelligence | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. An article cited states that [[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | communication skills]] alone account for 85% of one's success in life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Even in endeavors like starting a YouTube channel, [[social_skills_and_emotional_intelligence | social skills]] are deemed more essential than anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Foundation of Social Interaction: Hunger for Value
All [[understanding_social_skills_through_psychology | social skills]] are built upon a deeply ingrained human instinct: a fundamental hunger for value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Humans inherently desire to feel valuable within their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. Successfully satisfying this hunger in others can win them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

> "If you satisfy this hunger for someone in the right way... that person will become yours. You will win them over and anything you want them to do they will do." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

A personal anecdote illustrates this: a math tutor told a struggling, "slow to understand" student that despite his difficulties, he was "hardworking" and would eventually surpass his classmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This single sentence, described as "positive manipulation," motivated the student to study diligently, leading him to become one of the best students, driven by a desire to please the tutor and prove worthy of the praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This interaction was "food for the Instinct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Strategies for Feeding the Instinct and Improving Social Skills

### Golden Rule 1: Make Others Feel Important
To leave a positive impression and influence someone, the goal should be to make *them* feel like they have left an impression and influenced *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Instead of trying to show how amazing you are, show them that *they* are amazing and remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

This is achieved through **focused conversation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
1.  **Let them talk about themselves and build on what they say.** When someone shares an experience, keep the focus on them by asking follow-up questions like "Oh, and what did you do about it?" or "How did the date go?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Avoid shifting the focus back to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Active listening is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
2.  **Take a general topic and redirect it towards them.** For example, when discussing the weather, ask "What do *you* like more: rain or sunshine, summer or winter?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

By doing this, you give them value and satisfy their instinct, making them feel influential, and in turn, you influence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Golden Rule 2: Don't Try to Prove Anything
A significant [[confidence_in_social_interactions | social skills]] rule is that the moment someone begins to seek your admiration, you have already won them over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This is achieved by not needing to prove anything to that person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

*   **Handling Interruptions:** If someone interrupts you or changes the subject, allow it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Insisting on returning to your point can be a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This demonstrates that you don't need to assert yourself, displaying strength and increasing your value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   *Exception*: If someone *constantly* interrupts, directly and calmly tell them, "Why don't you let me finish what I'm saying?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. If they persist, there's no reason to continue engaging with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

### Recognize Their Presence as a Person
Accept and value people for who they are, not for their possessions or accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Avoid certain questions**: Don't ask about their job, degree, salary, or habits like smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. The person should feel you care about them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **Don't give unsolicited advice or lectures**: Refrain from telling people they need to change or giving advice unless asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows acceptance of them as they are, problems included <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Never place yourself above others**: Do not adopt a superior position to offer advice or tell others what to do, especially regarding their problems, unless they ask for help <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid correcting trivial inaccuracies**: If someone states a minor incorrect fact, don't immediately correct them if it doesn't meaningfully impact the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.

### Give Others the Opportunity to Earn Your Admiration
To encourage someone to seek your admiration:
*   **Ask for their opinion**: Humans often focus on expressing their own opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Learn to ask for others' opinions and genuinely listen to them, letting them express themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Ask for their suggestions**: When people offer suggestions or advice, listen to them instead of rejecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This indicates a desire to please you and earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
    *   Even if a suggestion isn't suitable, respond diplomatically (e.g., "That seems like a good idea but I need to think about it") rather than outright rejecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Never treat anyone as if they don't understand or as if you're superior**: Regardless of their education or age, avoid looking down on anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Treat everyone as your equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## [[Improving social skills as a practice | Social Skills as a Practice]]
The advice "be yourself" is dismissed as "the dumbest, worst and most absurd piece of advice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Just as one would encourage someone to quit smoking or go to the gym to improve their health, [[improving_social_skills_as_a_practice | social skills]] and communication are skills that require practice and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The journey of [[improving_social_skills_as_a_practice | social skills]] development is ongoing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

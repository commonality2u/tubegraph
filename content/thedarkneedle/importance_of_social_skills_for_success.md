[[building_social_skills_and_connections | Social skills]] are presented as the most crucial ability one can possess in life, potentially leading to universal admiration and the "key to life itself" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. When examining successful individuals such as CEOs, company executives, and world leaders, despite their diverse individual talents, they all share proficient [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. One article suggests that [[impact_of_communication_skills_on_building_relationships | communication skills]] alone account for 85% of life's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Even endeavors like starting a YouTube channel necessitate [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] above other abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## The Foundation of Social Skills: The Hunger for Value

A fundamental human instinct, deeply ingrained in our genes, is a "hunger for value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. This means humans inherently desire to feel valued within their environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. Successfully satisfying this hunger in others can win them over, making them receptive to your influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

### Case Study: The Math Tutor and His Student
An example illustrates this principle: A university student tutoring a "slow" high school student offered praise not for his intelligence, but for his hard work, stating he would eventually surpass his classmates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This "positive manipulation" motivated the student to study with immense energy, leading him to become one of the best students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. His motivation stemmed from a desire to please the tutor, prove deserving of the praise, and impress him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. This demonstrates how a single sentence fed the student's "hunger for value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Learning to properly feed this instinct in others can make you the most loved person in your [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social circle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Golden Rules for Cultivating Social Skills

### 1. Make Them Feel They Influenced You
A crucial rule is to make others feel as though *they* are the ones who left an impression and influenced you, rather than trying to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Instead of trying to show how amazing you are, highlight their amazing and remarkable qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

This can be achieved through **focused conversation**, where the discussion revolves around them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>:
*   **Let them talk about themselves**: When someone shares an experience, keep the focus on them by asking follow-up questions instead of shifting the conversation to yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. [[importance_of_presence_in_social_skills | Listening]] is key here <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Redirect general topics**: Even with a common topic like the weather, redirect it to elicit their personal preferences, such as asking what they like more â€“ rain or sunshine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This gives them value and satisfies their instinct, making them feel they have influenced you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### 2. Don't Try to Prove Anything
[[increasing_social_power_through_interactions | The moment someone starts trying to gain your admiration, you've won them over]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This is achieved by not trying to prove anything to them, demonstrating you don't need to assert yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

*   **Handling Interruptions**: If someone interrupts you or changes the subject, let them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This shows you're not trying to prove a point, which implies strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.
*   **When to be Direct**: If interruptions are constant, calmly and directly ask them to let you finish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. It's important to express yourself clearly and directly, especially for men, as society expects it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Avoid Tormenting Yourself**: If you don't enjoy talking to or being around someone who constantly interrupts despite your directness, simply stop engaging with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

### 3. Recognize Their Presence as a Person
[[importance_of_presence_in_social_skills | Valuing someone for who they are, not what they have or do]], is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

*   **Avoid Intrusive Questions**: Refrain from asking about their job, education, income, or personal habits like smoking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. They should feel you care about them as an individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   **No Unsolicited Advice**: [[avoiding_common_social_mistakes | Do not offer advice or lecture people unless they explicitly ask for it]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows acceptance of them as they are, with all their problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Never Place Yourself Above Others**: Do not put yourself in a higher position by giving unasked-for advice or trying to help with problems without being asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
*   **Avoid Correcting Trivialities**: Don't correct minor factual errors in conversation if it doesn't add anything meaningful to the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. This is a bad habit that offers no benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### 4. Give Opportunity to Earn Your Admiration
Encourage others to seek your admiration by showing genuine interest in their thoughts and contributions.

*   **Ask for Opinions**: Actively ask for and listen to others' opinions on topics, rather than focusing solely on expressing your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Ask for Suggestions**: Listen when people offer suggestions or advice. For example, if someone suggests a video topic for your YouTube channel, listen to them as they want to please you and earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. If an idea isn't suitable, politely say you need to think about it instead of outright rejecting it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   **Never Look Down on Anyone**: Even if someone is less educated or younger, never treat them as if they don't understand or as if you are better than them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Treat everyone as your equal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

## Social Skills as an Improvable Skill
The common advice "be yourself" is considered absurd, especially when it comes to [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Just as one would encourage someone to quit smoking or go to the gym to improve their health, [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] and communication are skills that require practice and continuous improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This process of enhancing [[building_social_skills_and_connections | social skills]] is an ongoing journey that requires dedication and continued learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

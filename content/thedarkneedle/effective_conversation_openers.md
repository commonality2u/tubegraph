This guide provides strategies for approaching and engaging women, from overcoming initial anxiety to securing contact information, focusing on [[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication | effective communication strategies]] and practical openers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Overcoming Approach Anxiety

It's crucial to stay calm before approaching someone, as nervousness can lead to a perceived lack of confidence and potential rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. To overcome the anxiety of approaching women, especially for those new to social settings, taking small actions is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

A simple exercise to build confidence is to approach 10 women daily and ask for the time, ensuring you're not wearing a watch and your phone is off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This exercise can boost confidence, making you feel more at ease after a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. It's also helpful to do this exercise a few minutes before planning to engage in longer conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Location

While nightclubs may seem like an obvious choice, they often present challenges for beginners due to high competition, defensive attitudes from women, and loud music making conversation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Attempting to meet women in such environments without much experience can lead to disappointment and discouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

Instead, consider more relaxed and conducive environments:
*   **Casual spots** such as parks, malls, or coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Hobby classes** like yoga, salsa dancing, or aerobics, which often have more women than men, providing more opportunities with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>.
*   **Other public places** like restaurants, public libraries, or malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

## The Approach Itself

### Timing the Approach

Once you've identified a woman you'd like to talk to ("your target"), make your approach within **5 seconds** of deciding to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. Delaying the approach increases the likelihood of your brain creating excuses, leading to hesitation and increased nervousness that can prevent you from approaching at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid

Many guys get rejected because they don't know the right way to approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>:
*   **Staring and Direct Approaches**: An average approach often involves staring, walking directly up, and then immediately asking for a drink or introducing oneself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. Women are "strongly programmed" to turn down such direct approaches, often assuming the guy is only looking for casual sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Pickup Lines**: Relying on witty pickup lines typically leads to more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
*   **Approaching from the Front**: If a woman sees you "charging towards her" from the front, she will likely put up a "wall of resistance" before you even speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   **Approaching from Behind**: Touching a woman on the shoulder or starting a conversation without her notice from behind can scare her and ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

The key to successful approaching is making her comfortable in your presence before attempting anything further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:00">[03:34:00]</a>. Trying too hard will make her sense "something fishy" and activate her defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.

### Recommended Approach Angles

The best way to approach is **from the side** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>. This approach does not scare her and prevents her from setting up her "wall of Defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

To do this effectively:
*   Walk past her.
*   Tilt your head in her direction.
*   Start the conversation while your chest is facing the other direction (talking over your shoulder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This posture is "non-threatening" and helps her feel comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Starting the Conversation (Openers)

Direct approaches are ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. To start [[effective_communication_strategies | conversations]], you must act in a manner that demonstrates you are not trying to "hit on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. The best way to open conversations is to be as natural as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

### Demonstrating Disinterest (Cell Phone Opener)

This opener is designed to lower her defenses by making it seem like you're not solely focused on her:
1.  Pretend to be on your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
2.  Pass by her, look over your shoulder, pause, and say into the phone, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
3.  Then, holding the phone to your ear, ask her, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men, is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
4.  After her response, hang up and say, "I'm in a hurry, but my friend said never to trust anything a female says half the time she would be lying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>.
5.  Continue the light banter until the conversation is successfully opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.

It's important to state you are in a hurry; this lowers her defenses by assuring her you won't linger and simultaneously demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. Avoid using "canned openers" without observing her behavior; always work according to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:16]</a>.

### Contextual Openers (Observational)

These openers use something in the immediate environment or about her to start a natural conversation:
*   **At a Restaurant**: If she's eating, ask about her dish: "Hey, what is it that you're eating?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:52:00">[06:52:00]</a>. Follow up by saying you're new to the place and need a recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
*   **Neutral Environment**: If there's nothing obvious to comment on in the environment, observe what she's wearing and comment on that <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>. For example, "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on, what's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.

### Guessing/Assumption Openers

Instead of asking a direct question, make a guess or assumption about her. This often prompts a response like "Why do you say that?", opening the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>.
*   Example: "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.
*   Follow up with a playful reason, like observing her clothing style: "Well, you have the Californian look about you... All you guys tend to dress like Barbie dolls, why is that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## Continuing the Conversation

Many guys feel lost after opening a conversation, leading to awkward silences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>. It's easy to open conversations, but harder to spark strong emotional attraction and transition to the next level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. To get her interested, apply various techniques from the series, such as qualifying, [[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication | listening like a therapist]], [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]], push and pull, and creating mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.

### Engaging the Group (Talking to Friends)

When approaching women in groups, a powerful technique is to talk to your target's friend more than the target herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Most guys focus solely on their target, making their interest obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. By spending more time on her friends, you make the target feel a bit jealous and curious because you are not giving her much attention, making her work for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.

*   Example: Ask your target, "Hey, are they your friends?" When she confirms, say, "Be a good girl, introduce me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   After introductions, immediately start talking more to one of her friends and "completely avoid her for a few minutes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This will make your target work harder to get your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>.

### Incorporating Physical Touch

Physical touch is critical for attraction; playful touch can double the impact of your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
*   **Hands**: Stare at her hands, then gently grab her fingers and say, "Oh, nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.
*   **Forehead**: Stare at her forehead, say "You have something on your forehead," and then do a slight clean-up with your fingers, saying "Okay, all clean now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>.
*   **Hair**: Stare at her hair and say, "Wow, nice color," or "How did you get it curly like that? Is this real hair?" then touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>.
*   **High Five**: Say, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team, give me a high five," and then give her a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:00">[10:46:00]</a>.

If a girl allows you to touch her once, she has likely lowered her defenses and will be more receptive to further physical escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

## Getting the Number

If everything else has been done correctly and you've had a good conversation, getting her phone number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:06:00">[11:06:00]</a>.

### Creating a Motive

Always provide a motive for her to give you her number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   **Curiosity/Story Method**: While telling an interesting story, mention, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," and continue the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. When she asks what you noticed after the story ends, check the time, say you're running late, hand her your phone, and say, "Here, enter your number, I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. She'll often enter it because she's interested in continuing the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>.
*   **Event Invitation**: "My friends are having this party on Saturday, it's one of the coolest events which happens only once a year. I have free passes, you should come." Then hand her your phone and say, "Here, punch in your number, I'll let you know the timings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:24:00">[12:24:00]</a>.

Asking for her number randomly, such as "Can I have your phone number?", will often result in rejection, and even if you get it, she may not remember you due to a lack of created attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

### Confirming the Number

Handing her your phone ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. You can even give her a quick call to confirm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. If she gives a wrong number, playfully say, "Oh, playing, aren't we?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. If she apologizes and offers to re-enter it, say, "No, never mind, I don't want it. It was great meeting you," and walk off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:00">[11:52:00]</a>.

### Handling Rejection

If she totally refuses to give you her number, it indicates you either did something wrong or didn't build enough attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. In this case, you can try one last push: "Come on, giddy up, I don't have much time here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>. If she still refuses, offer a friendly goodbye and walk off immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.

Once you have her phone number, it's important to exit the venue to avoid an awkward bump-in later and prevent the attraction you built from reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:52:00">[12:52:00]</a>.

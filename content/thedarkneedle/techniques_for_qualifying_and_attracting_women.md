This article explores the reasons why a woman might ignore you and introduces a powerful [[psychological_techniques_for_influencing_women | psychological technique]] called "qualifying" to make her chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. It advises against common mistakes and emphasizes shifting your mindset to be the chooser rather than the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

## Why a Girl Might Ignore You <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

A girl might ignore you for one of two main reasons:
1.  **It's a test:** This type of ignoring typically occurs if a woman was already interested in you or you've previously gone out with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **She perceives you as having limited options:** This is the more common reason, especially if she wasn't interested from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. If you give her too much attention, making her feel like she's your only focus and you're willing to do anything to please her, she will sense a lack of other options in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

## Avoiding Common Mistakes: The Problem with Lying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>

A significant mistake is trying to lie or hint that you have many options when you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This approach often backfires, leading to two outcomes:
1.  **She discovers you're lying:** Women can easily detect dishonesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Lying is a major [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] killer because it signals that you are willing to do anything to gain her [[techniques_to_trigger_a_womans_desire_for_approval | approval]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  **She realizes you're seeking her approval:** Even if she doesn't detect a direct lie, your attempts to convey that you have options will show that you are seeking her approval, which is one of the biggest [[avoiding_common_mistakes_when_attracting_women | mistakes]] in [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The key is not whether you *actually* have a lot of options, but how you *interact* with her. If you treat her in a way that suggests you have options, she will assume you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

## The Qualifying Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

Qualifying means screening or filtering, an action typically performed by someone who has many options and needs to choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you implicitly communicate that you have abundant options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

This technique helps solidify a girl's [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]], moving beyond initial flirting to genuine interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It makes her feel like she is *winning you over* and impressing you, rather than you chasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. The mantra to remember is: "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

It's crucial for her to feel that you like her for qualities beyond her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. If you don't qualify her, she might assume you're only interested in physical attraction or that you have limited options and will accept anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Three Ways to Qualify a Girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

#### 1. The Qualifying Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>
Ask questions that prompt her to share positive qualities about herself, and then acknowledge those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This makes her actively "sell herself" to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason, I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to, and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

When she shares, accept her for it by saying something like, "Wow, that's really cool, I like that about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This makes her feel special and valued for her personality, not just her looks, setting you apart from other men who often only value attractive women for their physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

#### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>
Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've noticed in her, then invite her to confirm it with a question that encourages a "yes" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Once she agrees, she will tend to act more consistently with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open, and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   "Know what I like about you? You're so bold, like you don't filter yourself at all. You just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing; it makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>

This approach makes her feel recognized for something valuable and unique, fostering a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Ensure the statement is genuine and positive, and vague enough that she can't definitively say no <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

**Qualities to look for:** Open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

> [!TIP] A great qualifying statement for a good-looking woman is: "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This appeals to her desire to be recognized beyond her physical appearance, as attractive people often wish their intelligence was more appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

#### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>
Often, women will naturally qualify themselves to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Your role is simply to notice and acknowledge her efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.

**Examples of her qualifying herself:**
*   Bragging about herself, hoping you'll accept her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touching you or showing direct interest, demonstrating she likes you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asking if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you sense she's trying to impress you, acknowledge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is cool, express that you like her, or physically accept her (e.g., put an arm around her) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This shows her she's winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. If you fail to acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

> [!NOTE] This technique is not exclusive to [[psychology_of_attracting_women | attracting women]]. Acknowledging others for their impressive qualities or ways of being is a powerful social skill that makes people feel seen and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

## Important Caveat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>

Applying only the qualifying technique from this video might lead to the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

The speaker recounts their youth as an introverted individual who struggled to form friendships despite reading books like "How to Win Friends and Influence People" and "How to Talk to Anyone" and watching videos on [[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | social skills]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. They realized these external tips were superficial and didn't help because the real issue lay in their [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | personality]] and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>. After studying psychology and human behaviors, they concluded that society's advice on [[communication_skills_and_charisma_development | social skills]] was often "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. They discovered that having charisma and being liked is simple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

Charisma is composed of three essential elements: [[the_importance_of_presence_over_explanation_in_building_attraction | presence]], [[expressing_warmth_through_kindness_and_acceptance | warmth]], and [[building_power_in_relationships | power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. These elements must be applied together in balance; if the balance is disrupted, problems will arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Presence

[[the_importance_of_presence_over_explanation_in_building_attraction | Presence]] is about making others feel strong, rather than demonstrating one's own strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This concept is illustrated by an 1886 UK election where the winning candidate made a journalist feel that *she* was the strongest person, not that the candidate was <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

Key aspects of [[the_importance_of_presence_over_explanation_in_building_attraction | presence]] include:

*   **Being a Good Listener**
    When someone is speaking, the focus should be entirely on what they are saying, without simultaneously planning a response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. True listening means caring about the speaker's words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. This deep listening makes the speaker feel valued and creates a connection, leading them to prefer talking to the listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. What to say afterward will naturally follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

*   **Being Comfortable and Spontaneous**
    It is crucial to be physically comfortable, whether sitting alone, with friends, or talking to someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. A relaxed [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | body language]] signals comfort to others, while discomfort suggests a desire to not be with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. True comfort comes from being at ease and spontaneous, allowing natural actions like sneezing without shyness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. When one is comfortable and does what they want (without harming others), those around them feel closer and also become more comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

## Warmth

[[expressing_warmth_through_kindness_and_acceptance | Warmth]] encompasses kindness, gentleness, affection, and love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This does not mean constantly praising others or being agreeable, which can be seen as hypocrisy and unnatural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

Key aspects of [[expressing_warmth_through_kindness_and_acceptance | warmth]] include:

*   **Understanding Non-Verbal Communication**
    Only 7% of communication relies on words; 93% depends on [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | body language]], feelings, and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Internal feelings, such as dislike, can be sensed by others even if not expressed verbally, affecting how they perceive a person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. Therefore, when interacting with new people or friends, it is important to internally feel admiration and be [[emphasizing_passion_and_enthusiasm_in_conversations | enthusiastic]] about talking to them and listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. These inner feelings will unconsciously reach the other person, fostering mutual connection and desire to be together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Always assume the person is good, within reasonable limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

*   **The Power of Giving**
    Adding value to someone's life through giving advice is beneficial, but it must not be imposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For example, if a friend mentions needing a house, share relevant information like a website, but do not push it or follow up relentlessly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Sharing information without insisting is a beautiful way to give <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

*   **Acceptance, Understanding, and Honesty (Positively)**
    While being agreeable for its own sake is boring and hypocritical, genuine [[expressing_warmth_through_kindness_and_acceptance | acceptance]] and understanding of others, combined with honesty, is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. If one doesn't like something, they should honestly say so, but without criticizing the other person's preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This means accepting the person as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Sincere praise for what one genuinely likes is also important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Brief, honest feedback on what one dislikes can also be given, provided the relationship allows for such directness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.

## Power

[[building_power_in_relationships | Power]] is about inner strength, [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | self-confidence]], and a strong [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | personality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

Key aspects of [[building_power_in_relationships | power]] include:

*   **Not Seeking Approval**
    Avoid talking too much about oneself or constantly seeking validation from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

*   **Confronting and Upholding Principles**
    One should not be afraid to confront people and stand by their principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. For example, if offered alcohol against one's principles, simply say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. It's important to set and enforce "red lines" when others try to overstep boundaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Furthermore, if one wants something, they should not be afraid to express it, such as complaining about bad food in a restaurant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

*   **Strong Body Language**
    [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | Body language]] is deeply connected to one's psyche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Feeling mentally strong will naturally reflect in one's [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Conversely, consciously adopting strong [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | body language]] can psychologically influence internal feelings of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Being comfortable, relaxed, and allowing natural movements of hands and legs helps cultivate this internal feeling of strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Imagining oneself as the strongest person in the room and acting accordingly can help maintain this confident [[building_selfconfidence_and_strong_body_language | body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

Charisma's benefits extend beyond merely being liked; it aids in efficient work, career advancement, and overall life success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>.

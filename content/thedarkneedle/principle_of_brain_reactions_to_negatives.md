Our brains are fundamentally wired to react more strongly to negative stimuli than to positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This principle dictates that the brain is primarily programmed to avoid danger rather than to seek out positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## How the Brain Prioritizes Negatives

The human brain's strong reaction to negatives can be illustrated with an example of a smoker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>:
*   If a doctor tells a smoker that continued smoking will lead to immediate death or a heart attack, the smoker will likely stop immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.
*   However, if the doctor states that quitting smoking will maintain their health, it's less likely the smoker will cease the habit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.
This difference in response highlights that our brains are more attuned to the threat of loss or harm than to the promise of benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Application in Attraction: Shared Hatred

While finding common ground in positive interests (like a shared song or movie) can be a good way to break the ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>, a more effective and faster method for building attraction is to find something you both dislike or hate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This approach leverages the brain's natural inclination to bond over shared negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### Forms of Shared Hatred

Shared hatred can manifest in various ways:

*   **Common Enemy:** Throughout history, a shared enemy has been a powerful catalyst for forming alliances and attracting people to one another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.
    *   Examples include mutual dislike for social media's superficiality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a> or how dating apps have made relationships difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
    *   Asking "What is the thing you hate the most?" or "Who is your enemy?" can open this avenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. When expressing this shared dislike, it's crucial to do so passionately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Dislike of a Specific Person:** People tend to bond more over individuals they dislike than those they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If you and another person share a dislike for a boss, teacher, or an annoying customer, it can quickly create a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if you don't share the dislike, listening attentively and observing her passionate expression of hatred can build rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **"Partners in Crime" Dynamic:** Creating an "us against them" or "You and Me Against the World" dynamic fosters a strong connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This involves having inside jokes or secretly pranking others together, leading to shared moments of "talking trash" about a common authority figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Simple Dislikes:** Shared hatred can be as straightforward as disliking a particular food, a city, a TV show, or a movie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Engaging in conversation where both parties express their strong dislike for these simple things can also create a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

Utilizing the brain's instinct to bond through negative emotions is a powerful strategy for creating attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

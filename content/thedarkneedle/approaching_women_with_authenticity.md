Approaching women with authenticity is centered on being genuine, expressing natural thoughts, and avoiding artificial attempts to appear "cool" or confident <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This method emphasizes self-ease and honesty, which is key to creating a comfortable and open environment for interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The Authentic Approach in Practice

The speaker recounts a personal experience of trying to [[approaching_women_in_public | approach a girl]] at a bar. Initial thoughts were filled with doubt and overthinking, such as wondering if she was with someone, what to say, or if she wanted to be bothered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. However, the fear of regret often serves as a motivator to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

The authentic approach involves:
*   **Speaking your mind** Instead of forcing a persona or trying to seem cool, simply say what you're thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This helps lift pressure and allows for natural interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
*   **Dropping the "shield"** Don't hide who you truly are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Any attempt to act with fake [[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | confidence]] or hide behind a "crutch" prevents genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Spontaneity** Being spontaneous and not taking things too seriously is a crucial quality for attracting women and living happily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Overthinking or worrying often works against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Genuine Intentions** Women are always "reading" you and can sense when your intentions are not completely honest or genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Initial Approach Lines
Instead of rehearsed pickup lines, the speaker suggests direct and honest openers that state your attraction and intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
*   "Hey, you're cute. I wanted to get to know you. I am [your name]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   "Hey, you're attractive, what's your name?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

The purpose of these lines is to avoid hiding your attraction, as there is no shame in wanting to know someone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

## Shameless Interest vs. Compliments

A core aspect of authentic approach is "Shameless Interest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This involves clearly stating your interest without being ashamed of it.
*   **Asking directly:** One of the first questions when attracted to a girl can be, "Are you single?" to establish clear intent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Playful expressions of interest:** Examples include, "Stop being so cute, you made me forget what I was going to say" or "What an incredibly adorable person you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Distinguishing Shameless Interest from Compliments
There is a significant difference between showing shameless interest and giving compliments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>:
*   **Shameless Interest:** "I like your hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This is casual and expresses personal preference.
*   **Compliment:** "Your hair is beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. This is something she hears frequently and can lead to being perceived as weak or placed in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

A "lover" expresses direct interest ("I'm interested in you"), while a "friend" gives general compliments ("You're beautiful") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It's also acceptable to mention what you don't find appealing to maintain authenticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## The Power of Non-Verbal Communication

The actual words spoken when [[effective_communication_with_women | approaching a girl]] hold less value than the feeling they generate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Attraction is 80% to 90% non-verbal, relying on "subcommunication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

Subcommunication includes:
*   Tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

This non-verbal communication speaks directly to the subconscious, where emotional and sexual desire originate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.

### The Impact of Laughter
A study on laughter suggests that a powerful, loud laugh, reminiscent of ancient tribal leaders, conveys strength and fearlessness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Conversely, quiet laughter can signify weakness or a desire to avoid drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. While society often considers loud laughter impolite, cultivating a powerful laugh can significantly enhance social life and [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | interactions with women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Laughter is one of the most important elements in human connection and a top attractor for both men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

## Assuming Attraction

Men who are perceived as having "options" in dating tend to assume women are attracted to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. This assumption leads to a relaxed demeanor; if a woman isn't interested, it doesn't bother them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. In contrast, men who lack options often assume disinterest and may cling to any hint of interest, trying too hard to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Trying too hard subtly communicates a lack of options, which is unattractive to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

Therefore, for effective [[effective_communication_with_women | communication with women]], assume attraction. If you're feeling good and have something genuine to say, say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. If not, simply introduce yourself and state your purpose directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The goal is to discover if she is interesting and worth your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Anything beyond this is "over effort" and counterproductive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## Learning from Experience

The speaker shares that his initial bar story was actually about a friend who successfully [[approaching_women_in_public | approached the girl]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. His own experience ended in regret due to overthinking and hesitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. This personal failure served as a valuable lesson on the importance of acting authentically and avoiding regret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

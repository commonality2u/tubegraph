To master [[role_of_boldness_and_cheekiness_in_attraction | impudence]], a crucial component in attracting women, it is necessary to be slightly disrespectful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This approach does not advocate for being insulting, calling names, or treating someone poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. Instead, it involves extending the same level of respect you would give to your closest friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## The Rationale Behind "Slight Disrespect"
With friends, individuals are typically not "super respectful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. For instance, if a friend calls and wakes you at 6 AM, you might react with bluntness, unlike how you'd treat a coworker in a similar situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Many men mistakenly treat women with the extreme politeness reserved for figures like an elementary school principal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>, walking on eggshells and preventing any [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | emotional reaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. This overly nice behavior is precisely what should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

Over-respecting a woman can lead her to believe she is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>. While extreme disrespect is also to be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>, the most effective approach is to treat a woman with the same level of respect you'd offer a best friend, even upon first meeting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This is distinct from the [[difference_between_types_of_respect_in_romantic_contexts | type of respect]] typically discussed in conventional contexts.

## Practical Application
One key method to demonstrate slight disrespect is by not directly responding to what she has just said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many men feel obligated to treat every statement from a woman as sacred, providing long, thoughtful replies to her questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

Instead, consider these tactics:
*   **Delaying Direct Answers** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>: If she asks, "So, where did you grow up?" you could pivot by saying, "Oh, so last night I was out..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. You can always return to her question later, for example, by saying, "Oh, right. You asked me where I grew up," and then answering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. While it's important to build a connection, don't feel compelled to provide information simply because she asked for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.
*   **Controlling the Conversation Flow** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>: This approach indicates that she is not controlling the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. It also makes the interaction more interesting by being non-linear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   **Creating Surprise and Unpredictability** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>: By leaving a gap between her question and your answer, you create a space for surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This triggers attraction by generating an [[creating_excitement_in_interactions | emotional reaction]] and a sense of fun and unpredictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **Making Her "Earn" Your Attention** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>: This tactic communicates that she needs to win you over and that you won't passively submit just because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Slight disrespect, combined with cheekiness, boldness, and shamelessness, demonstrates strength and prevents giving excessive attention, prompting a woman to pursue you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

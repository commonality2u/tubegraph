When a man senses rapport with a woman, he may become hesitant to deviate from safe topics, fearing he might shatter the connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. This approach is often counterproductive, leading to boredom for the woman who was initially interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. It's akin to being served plain oatmeal when expecting a gourmet meal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

## What is Qualifying?
Qualifying is a technique to [[increasing_her_investment_and_attraction | increase her investment and attraction]] by strategically placing yourself in the role of the selector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. It involves making statements or asking questions that might initially seem to disqualify her as a potential partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. This doesn't mean genuinely rejecting her; instead, it creates a playful dynamic where she feels motivated to "prove herself" to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

## How to Qualify in Conversation

Once you've sparked a woman's interest, begin to qualify her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This method helps in [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | maintaining attraction and emotional engagement]] and shifts the conversational dynamic.

### Example Scenario:
Consider a common "get to know you" question about pets.
*   **You:** "So, do you have any pets?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>
*   **Her:** "Yeah, I have three of the cutest cats in the world." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>
*   **You (Qualifying statement):** "Hm, we would never get along. I'm a dog person, and I've heard that dog and cat owners tend to have a really intense sexual connection but disagree on every other possible point." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>
*   **Her:** "Oh, really? Well, maybe we could find some common ground." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>

In this exchange, you've taken a safe topic (pets) and skillfully steered it into more intriguing territory, even hinting at sexuality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. By saying "we would never get along," you subtly challenge her, placing the burden of approval-seeking on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>. This transforms the conversation from polite small talk into a playful battle of wits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

### Benefits of Qualifying
*   **Shifts Dynamics:** It places you in the position of the selector, making her feel compelled to invest more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
*   **Creates Playfulness:** It turns potentially mundane topics into a more engaging and fun exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. This aligns with [[creating_playful_and_fun_interactions_with_women | creating playful and fun interactions with women]] and [[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication | techniques for effective interpersonal communication]].
*   **Increases Interest:** It moves beyond surface-level conversation, hinting at deeper connection and excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

Qualifying is a key aspect of [[effective_communication_strategies_in_relationships | effective communication strategies in relationships]] that can significantly improve engagement and attraction.

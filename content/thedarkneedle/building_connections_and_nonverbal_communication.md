To convince someone or get them to act as desired, there are two steps: first, understanding their inner mind, and second, using the right words to influence their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This concept can also be applied to meeting, attracting, or winning over others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Entering the Inner Mind through Connection
The fastest way to enter someone's inner mind is by [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | building a connection]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. A connection involves deliberately [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | creating a match]] or "instant bond" with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is easier to convince someone you connect with than someone you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Role of Non-Verbal Communication
The brain constantly and unconsciously processes non-verbal information about people, including facial expressions and [[body_language_techniques_during_conversations | body language]] (how a person sits, walks, and moves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The human body can be thought of in three parts (head, body, feet) that send non-verbal messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

A connection is based on the idea that what your body does affects how you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Observing others' body and face movements can help understand their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Copying their movements may lead to feeling the same way due to the link between body and mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

#### Experiment: Posture and Mood
To understand this link, try the following:
*   **Walk with head up, looking at the skyline, smiling** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   **Walk with head down, looking at the ground, slow pace, hands in pockets, dragging feet** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Notice the change in mood between these two postures; the mood shift is directly connected to how the body is held, without conscious happy or sad thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

#### Mirroring and Adapting Mood
If changing posture affects mood, then copying someone else's posture can lead to feeling what they feel, helping to understand their mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. To make a connection, adjust your mood to match theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

**Steps to Adjust Mood:**
1.  **Observe posture and define the mood:** e.g., bored, happy, sad, curious, enthusiastic, calm, nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Choose a person for practice:** Start with someone pleasant with whom you don't have a serious connection, like a cashier or neighbor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
3.  **Mirror and immerse:** Use your body to mirror their posture and define their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. Use inner dialogue to repeatedly think of the mood-defining word and align thoughts with the desired mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
4.  **Recall memories:** Remember past images, feelings, and sounds from when you felt that way to truly experience the mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
5.  **Approach and speak:** Approach the person while maintaining the mood and speak normally until you are both on the same emotional wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Once a connection is established (you will "just feel it") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, you can gradually change your gestures, posture, and smile, which will shift your mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Observe the other person's mood changing along with yours, indicating a subconscious influence through nonverbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

> [!caution] Adapting vs. Imitating
> There's a significant difference between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Adapt to aspects of others' movements subtly without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Do not copy gestures like a mirror, as this is imitation and can lead to embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Verbal Techniques for Influence
Beyond nonverbal communication, the way words are used can have a psychological effect on a person's subconscious, reducing refusals and increasing agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. This requires making a connection first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

Here are [[techniques_for_effective_interpersonal_communication | techniques for effective interpersonal communication]]:

### Emphasize the Obvious
State something as obvious to make a person believe it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   "We both know it's worth it once we go there." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>
*   "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>
*   "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>

### Ask a Question That Isn't Really a Question
To make a person's subconscious agree, state what you want them to agree with and add a question at the end, with a decreasing tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   "You already know everything about that, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
*   "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   "Probably it's time for another drink, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   "My plane is about to take off. There's no problem if I skipped a line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>

> [!caution] Limitations
> This approach is useful in everyday life but cannot be relied upon for major commitments like marriage, sex, or large sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The tone of voice should decrease at the end, unlike a usual question, to avoid inviting a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Get Them to Say Yes
Using "let's" followed by what you want to do is like a disguised order, making it harder for others to refuse compared to "should we" questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   "Let's walk a bit more." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   "Let's have another one." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>
*   "Let's go to my place." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>

The more people say yes, the more likely they are to continue saying yes, training their minds to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Save the main request for after they've said yes multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Offer Limited Choices
Present two options that both suit your desired outcome, without offering the choice of refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait, or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> (This example offers choices between alcohol, not alcohol or no alcohol) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   "Water or wine? Red or white, sir? Still or sparkling?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>

> [!warning] Overused Phrases
> Avoid lines like "My place or your place" as they are overused <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Anticipate the Future
Tell others how you expect them to react to something, influencing their actual reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   "I know you'll be thrilled about this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
*   "I know you'll want to repeat the experience." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>
*   "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you. I know you'll be impressed." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>

### Logical Leaps
Use "therefore" or "this means that" to connect two concepts, where the first is true and the second is what you want others to agree with, even if the connection isn't inherently logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   "You're watching this video (true), this means that you like it (maybe true)." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>
*   "We've been together for 3 months, therefore I must be serious about this relationship." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
*   "I've been working at this company for 3 years and have proven my loyalty, this means that it's time to take action and discuss my position in the company and my salary." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>

### Order and Order (Disguised Commands)
Give a true desired command, then immediately follow it with another command that you think will definitely be followed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The person will usually follow the first command without questioning, hearing only the second one clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   "It's late and you're tired. Take out the garbage and come to bed early." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>
*   "Come over to my place to have a dream." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>

### "I Shouldn't Tell You This But..."
This approach fosters a feeling of loyalty and trust, making others feel special and encouraging them to treat you as a confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### The Power of "But"
The information that follows "but" receives the most attention and emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   "He is always late to work, but he's good at what he's doing." (Emphasizes his quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>
*   "He's good at what he's doing, but he's always late to work." (Emphasizes his lateness) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly to new environments." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>
*   "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>
*   "I really like you, but I feel better without a partner at this time." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>

### The Ideal Question
Phrasing a question using "ideal" or "ideally" prompts others to tell the truth about what they want, creating images of perfect things in their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This provides information to influence them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   "What do you ideally want?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
*   "What are you ideally seeing?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>
*   "What would you ideally like to happen?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>
*   "What would be the ideal result?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>

When asked in a job interview ("ideally what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>), the interviewer describes their ideal candidate, allowing you to give the impression of being that candidate by using their words and adapting your answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Tell It Without Telling It
Express your point of view and create images in others' minds by stating what you "can't" or "won't" do, or what you "don't want" to think about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. You can also give orders by telling someone *not* to do what you actually want them to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   "I can't tell you to leave him. The decision must be yours." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>
*   "I won't be the one to tell you that you're wrong." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>
*   "I don't even want to think about the stress you're feeling now." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>
*   "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>

### Yes Means No ("I Could If You Want")
This offers to do something you don't really want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   "I could give you a ride home if you want." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   "I could do it if you want." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>

### It's Not Important But It Is
Use these phrases to give feedback that the other person might not like or want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   "I know that you won't consider my advice, but I'm worried about your unhealthy lifestyle." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>
*   "Maybe you won't care, but your deodorant is too weak and doesn't last long. Have you thought about keeping one for backup at the office?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>

### "I Don't Know If You Realize..." (Polite Way to Say "Listen")
This is a pleasant way to indicate that the other person should pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>
*   "I don't know if you realize how long I've been tolerating this." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>
*   "I don't know if you realize how long I've been waiting my turn." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>

These techniques are part of a broader series on [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | how attraction works]] and how women think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

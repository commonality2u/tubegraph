When interacting with women, a "small problem" that may arise is the presence of [[handling_tests_from_women | tests]] that women will put you through <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

## What Are These Tests?
A woman's subconscious "radar," which controls attraction and seeks a suitable man, will prompt her to perform certain actions to "test" you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The purpose of these [[handling_tests_from_women | tests]] is for her radar to determine if you are genuinely the "real deal" or the "right guy" for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Impact of Tests
When these [[handling_tests_from_women | tests]] occur, men often tend to panic and lose focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. A single [[handling_tests_from_women | test]] can cause a man to lose his composure and forget prior advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. Furthermore, a single [[handling_tests_from_women | test]] can lead her to doubt your authenticity, making her suspect you are merely pretending to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Addressing the Problem
The strategies for effectively dealing with the problem of [[handling_tests_from_women | tests]] will be discussed in upcoming episodes of this series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

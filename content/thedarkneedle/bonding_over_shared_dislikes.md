Attracting someone can be accelerated by understanding how the human brain processes information, specifically its stronger reaction to negative stimuli compared to positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Our brains are naturally programmed to avoid danger more than they are programmed to seek good things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. This principle can be leveraged in interactions to create a faster and more effective attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Instead of focusing solely on finding common likes, a more powerful approach is to identify and discuss shared dislikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This method has been observed as one of the most effective ways to foster strong attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Types of Shared Dislikes

Shared hatred can manifest in various forms:

*   **Common Enemies**
    Historically, a [[creating_alliances_through_common_enemies | common enemy]] has been one of the strongest ways to build alliances and attract people to each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This could involve hating abstract concepts like social media for making people superficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>, or dating apps for ruining relationships and making dating meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. A key question to ask is, "What is the thing you hate the most? Who is your enemy?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a> If you share the same dislike, expressing it passionately can create a strong bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

*   **Disliking a Specific Person**
    People tend to bond more over individuals they dislike than those they love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. If you and another person both dislike the same individual—such as a boss, a teacher, or an annoying customer—this shared animosity can quickly form a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even if you don't share the same dislike, listening carefully and observing her passionate, emotional expression of hatred can save time in building rapport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

*   **"Partners in Crime" Dynamic**
    Creating a "You and Me Against the World" dynamic fosters a strong connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This involves engaging in minor pranks, having inside jokes about certain people or situations, and mutually "trash-talking" a shared annoyance like a boss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. This "us against them" vibe is a powerful frame to establish in interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

*   **Simple Dislikes**
    Shared dislikes can be as simple as a food you both find unappetizing, a city you both consider boring, or a TV show or movie you both think is terrible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Discussing these shared aversions and expressing your mutual dislike can be a powerful way to bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

The ability to bond through negative emotions can be a significant advantage in attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

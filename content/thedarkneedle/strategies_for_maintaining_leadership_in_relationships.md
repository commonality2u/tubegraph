To foster a relationship where a woman strives to gain your approval, which is key to maintaining leadership and attraction, it is essential to understand and implement specific psychological strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. This approach leverages an innate female instinct to gain validation from others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, which is deeply rooted in women's genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. When a man effectively taps into this instinct, the woman becomes more invested in gaining his approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Core Principle: Make Her Strive for Your Approval

The fundamental rule is to put a girl in a state where she wants to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This is one of the easiest things to achieve because the instinct for approval is already within her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The key is to go "with the flow" of this natural inclination, not against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Relationships are primarily governed by emotion, not logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Therefore, men should avoid trying to impress the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. One of the most attractive traits in a man is not being overly concerned with gaining a woman's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Overcoming Internal Pressure

Modern society often places a high value on women, leading men to subconsciously feel they need to earn a woman's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. To counteract this programming, recognize and acknowledge the internal pressure to impress a beautiful girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

Instead of trying to change this action directly, redirect the internal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. When feeling the urge to impress, tell yourself: "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This shift in mindset, though initially confusing, helps overcome the pressure and allows her the space to want your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## Strategies for Maintaining Control and Standards

[[strategies_for_maintaining_control_and_standards_in_relationships | Strategies for maintaining control and standards in relationships]] are crucial for building attraction and leadership. The "recipe" for achieving this involves two key ingredients:

### 1. Not Giving Her Immediate Validation

A woman instinctively craves admiration and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. For her to want to earn your validation, it must not be given easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. If validation is given immediately, it ends the "game" of her striving for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

*   Avoid excessive engagement on social media, such as liking every post or commenting on everything she shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Do not appear obsessed with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 2. Expressing Your Preferences

Simultaneously, communicate what you like in a girl's personality and appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. When she perceives a lack of immediate validation and hears your preferences, her internal instincts activate. She will begin to consider how to gain your admiration by aligning with your expressed likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This puts her in a state where she actively tries to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Conditions for Effective Application

To properly "cook" this recipe, specific conditions must be met:

### Condition 1: Partial Alignment

When stating your preferences (e.g., liking girls who wear dresses, introverted girls, or those who don't wear too much makeup), ensure that approximately 40% of what you like is already present in her, while 60% is not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This prevents you from appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

By not giving her validation for common behaviors (like wearing a shirt) and instead, giving it when she aligns with your preferences (like wearing a dress), you become the influential factor in her desire to gain your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

### Condition 2: General Expression of Opinion

When expressing your likes, speak generally and reflect only your opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Do not explicitly tell her to change or imply that doing so will lead to your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. Avoid giving the impression that you're telling her what you like so she can earn your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

*   Example: Say "I like girls with short hair," not "You should cut your hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
*   Speak casually and do not direct your words specifically at her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   She will automatically apply your expressed preferences to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. For instance, if you mention not liking smokers or liking organized people, she will consider these traits in relation to herself and your perceived interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Condition 3: Selective Reaction

Do not react to everything she does simply because she did it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Many men make the mistake of reacting to a woman's actions or words just because she is beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.

*   If she says something dull or silly, do not laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While it might seem logical to avoid embarrassing her, allowing her to feel a little uncomfortable can increase attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   Only react if what she says is genuinely good or remarkable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   This teaches her that you are not easily impressed and that genuine qualities are required to earn your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Never let a girl feel that anything she does will impress you; always convey that your admiration requires unique and exceptional qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Condition 4: Approach with Curiosity, Not Admiration

When asking questions or trying to get to know her, your approach should stem from a place of curiosity, not admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Act as if you haven't yet decided whether you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

*   Reflect this mindset in your body language and tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Avoid an overly eager smile or enthusiastic tone when asking about her job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
*   Internally feel that you are asking purely out of curiosity; this internal intention will automatically reflect in your behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

#### Avoiding Interrogation

Never allow a girl to interrogate you, especially in early conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. If she repeatedly asks questions and you keep explaining yourself, she takes control of the conversation and judges you, which goes against natural dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

*   As the man, you are the one who chooses and leads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   If interrogated, avoid it by saying "It's a long story," "Take a guess," or give a short answer and redirect the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Condition 5: Countering Her Attempts to Impress

If she starts trying to win your approval by stating achievements (e.g., "I practice Taekwondo," "I got excellent grades"), your internal pressure to gain *her* approval might be triggered, especially if you share common interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

*   Do not reciprocate by revealing your similar achievements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This denies her the opportunity to win your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   Instead, casually comment on what she said, or better yet, make it seem like you are *bad* at the subject she is trying to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
    *   Example: If she says she practices Taekwondo, respond with "I tried it once and I almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.
    *   Example: If she boasts about math grades, say "Well, I was terrible at math" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

This approach gives her the space to impress you, highlighting her capabilities and allowing her to actively strive for your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. By combining these techniques, a man can create a strong desire in a woman to win his approval, putting her in a state where she actively tries to make him admire her, thus maintaining leadership and gaining her devotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

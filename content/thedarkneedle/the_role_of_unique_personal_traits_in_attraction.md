For a woman to love you, she must first miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This concept dates back to prehistoric times when a caveman would disappear for long periods to hunt, causing his wife to miss him and leading women to develop the feeling of longing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. As [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | emotional beings]], women need certain emotions planted within them, such as missing you, to become attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

It's a common misconception that initiating a "no contact" rule will make a woman miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This approach is ineffective and may lead her to forget you entirely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The feeling of missing someone involves two phases: when you are together and when you are apart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Cultivating Uniqueness While Together

The first phase focuses on how you interact and communicate while you are with a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. A powerful principle for making a lasting impression involves engaging the senses, similar to how brands embed themselves in a client's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>. The more senses you engage, the stronger the impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

To apply this to personal [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | traits]], add something unique to your personality that extends beyond interactions with her, affecting your entire life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

Consider these practical methods:
*   **Signature Greeting** Instead of a normal greeting, create a unique way of saying hello, perhaps with an unusual word or a distinct accent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Unique Fragrance** Use a specific fragrance so that your scent becomes part of your identity, allowing people to recognize you by your smell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Distinctive Accessory** Incorporate a unique accessory into your clothing, such as a specific ring, that makes you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>. For example, wearing a white ring on the pinky finger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.

Creating something unique and repeating it consistently, linked to one or more senses, will leave a lasting impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. This method can be used to make anyone remember you, not just women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. The key takeaway is to actively do things that make you unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Ending Conversations Strategically

Another crucial aspect is how you end conversations or dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. When a conversation or date is at its peak and you are both enjoying the best moments, that is the ideal time to end it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>. The goal is to leave her wanting more conversation, ensuring the last 10 minutes are very enjoyable for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

There are two approaches to achieve this:
*   **The Hard Way (Humor)**: If you are naturally funny, try to make her laugh as the conversation nears its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. This can be challenging as laughter isn't easily controlled, but if you're both already laughing, you can suddenly end the conversation with a simple statement like, "Alright, I have to go now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.
*   **The Easy Way (Evoking Emotions)**: Since women are [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | emotional beings]] who enjoy strong emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, make her feel something strong just before you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. This causes her mind to enter a state of confusion, leading her to think about you long after you're gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

To trigger strong emotions:
1.  **Discuss Past Experiences**: Talk about her experiences, as they are deeply tied to emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. Ask questions like:
    *   "What made you move to this city?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>
    *   "What's the biggest adventure you've been on?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>
    *   "What's the most exciting place you've visited?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>
    *   To deepen the connection, ask about her feelings during those moments, e.g., "How did it feel when you did that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. If your experiences differ, relate by sharing situations that triggered similar emotions in you, but always shift the focus back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
2.  **Discuss Future Aspirations**: Evoke emotions related to the future by discussing her goals, dreams, and ambitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Asking about her dreams stimulates positive and hopeful emotions that will be associated with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   "What are your biggest goals?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:00">[08:02:00]</a>
    *   "What are some things you've always wanted to do?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>
    *   "What are you aiming to achieve this year?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>
    *   Further deepen the conversation with questions like, "How would you feel if you did that?" or "What would your life look like if you accomplished that dream?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>.

By opening discussions on past experiences or future aspirations right before ending the conversation, you'll make her think about you and give her a reason to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:00">[08:16:00]</a>.

## Building [[basic_principles_of_attraction | Attraction]] Through Absence

[[basic_principles_of_attraction | Attraction]] often increases when you are not with a woman and not talking to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Many men mistakenly feel pressured to maintain constant communication, fearing she will forget them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>. However, this period of absence is when the crucial feeling of missing you should be cultivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

### Communication While Apart

*   **Texting**: Avoid the "don't reply too fast" or "don't text too much" games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. Deliberately delaying a reply makes you seem to be playing games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Instead, genuinely be unavailable. Inform her that you do not use your phone before a certain time, such as 7:00 PM, because you are busy with work, studies, or other commitments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>. Make this a consistent habit, demonstrating that you are a busy man with other things to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Phone Calls**: Never answer all her calls immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>. If she can predict all your actions and understands you completely, you lose the "game" and she may start avoiding you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>. Make her feel that you have a busy life and that other things are more important than instantly answering her calls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>. For example, if you're watching a movie, tell her, "I'm a bit busy right now, call me later. I'm watching a movie" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a>. This seemingly small act can increase her interest subconsciously because she realizes she needs to work for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>.

### Dating Frequency

*   **Limit Dates**: Do not meet her all the time, especially in the early stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. Aim to see her once a week, or at most twice, and avoid daily dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
*   **Planned Absences**: Introduce long periods of absence from time to time, such as not seeing her for two weeks and reducing communication during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>. This absence should always be for a stated reason, such as traveling or focusing on an important project <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>. This gives her the space and opportunity to miss you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>.

Combining these strategies will trigger feelings of longing and contribute to attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

Attracting women involves understanding their psychology and stirring their emotions in specific ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The core concept for making a woman "obsessed" and "addicted" is "drama," which refers to the deliberate creation of mixed emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This emotional stir keeps you in her thoughts, both when she goes to bed and when she wakes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## You as the Source of Emotion

Women are emotional beings driven by feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. To make a woman love you, you must stir her emotions, but crucially, *you* need to be the source of those feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. External emotions, like the atmosphere of a beautiful place, hold no value for attracting her to *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. For example, if a movie moves her emotionally, she'll be attracted to the film, not necessarily to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Your conversations and interactions should be woven with emotions that originate from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Creating Excitement: Mixing Attention with Indifference

Excitement is a crucial ingredient created by combining attention with a touch of indifference in your conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This means sometimes complimenting her and other times offering a critique in a way that stirs her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### The Right Way to Compliment or Critique

Avoid approaches that don't evoke excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The correct way to deliver criticism is to show some attention, then add a hint of indifference without being completely uninterested or overly attentive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

The pattern should be:
*   One line showing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>
*   Another line showing a bit of disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>

**Examples:**
*   "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This shows interest (beautiful) but also indifference (pink would be better), signaling you're interested but not chasing her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   To show interest, reverse the structure: "If this dress were pink, it would be better, but still it looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### The Power of the Last Impression

People tend to remember the last thing said to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This principle applies to creating emotional swings:
*   "You're a smart person, but your problem is that you talk too much" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a> will be perceived negatively due to the ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   "You talk too much, but despite that, you're a very smart person" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> will be perceived positively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Applying this to attraction:
*   Simply telling a girl she's beautiful often won't evoke much, as she likely hears it constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   However, saying "You're so short, but still you're adorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> creates an emotional rise and fall. She'll feel a slight dip initially, then her emotions will rise again, generating excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Always mix attention and indifference in your conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### When to Show Complete Attention

You can show complete attention when she does something you specifically like <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. For example:
*   If you've expressed a love for the color green and she wears a green shirt, it's fine to say, "This shirt looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   Similarly, if you don't like black and she wears a black shirt, it's okay to say, "This shirt doesn't look great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Maintaining Mystery and Curiosity

A crucial aspect of [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | maintaining attraction]] and emotional engagement is to keep a woman in a constant state of guessing about your interest and next moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

### Not Revealing Feelings Too Early

Most movies perpetuate the myth that women love it when men are honest about their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. In reality, if you tell a girl you love her too early, she'll instantly lose attraction for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This is because you "kill the element of mystery in the game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Her attraction often stems from the uncertainty of your true feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This is why many men face [[overcoming_rejection_and_maintaining_attraction | rejection]] after confessing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

You should never show her that you *want* her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. While she'll naturally assume interest if you're talking and meeting, never reveal your feelings too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Let her stay in a state of mystery and keep playing the guessing game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. Even if she confesses her love, she should still want you more than you want her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Strategic Information Disclosure (Mystery)

Being mysterious doesn't mean fabricating your personality; it means not giving away too much information about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Giving detailed answers to every question can signal low value and negatively affect her perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

**Examples of mysterious responses:**
*   **Her:** "Where do you work?"
    **You:** "Guess, and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Her:** "What are you doing Saturday night?"
    **You:** "Something fun, but it's a secret. Sorry, I can't tell you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Her:** "Have you ever been in a relationship before?"
    **You:** "I don't know you well enough yet. I don't share personal things with strangers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

While the level of mystery should gradually decrease over time, always maintain some degree of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. Keep her wondering about your activities and details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

## Unpredictability and Emotional Variety

To evoke a wide range of emotions and keep a girl attracted for a long time, you need to be unpredictable in everything you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. Keep her guessing about your next move, maintaining a slight sense of mystery and unpredictability in your conversations, behavior, and expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. A good mix of emotions is key; don't let any single emotion dominate all the time, as that can become boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. This approach contributes to [[creating_mixed_emotions_in_a_relationship | creating mixed emotions in a relationship]], which is vital for sustained attraction.

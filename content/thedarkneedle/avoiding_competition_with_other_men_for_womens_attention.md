To genuinely [[fundamental_mindset_for_attracting_women|attract women]] and stop being ignored, it is crucial to never compete for a woman's attention or approval with other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. This principle is considered foundational to [[understanding_behavior_and_its_impact_on_attention_from_women|behavior]] that leads to attraction.

## The Problem with Competition

When men gather, it's common to see some trying to gain a woman's attention by competing. This can involve attempts to:
*   Tell the best joke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>
*   Appear stronger than others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>
*   Share the most exciting story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>
*   Even become rude to other men to make themselves look better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>

The moment a man starts competing for a woman's approval, it signals [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women|neediness]] and insecurity. It shows that he is putting in effort to impress her, which is a major turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:40:00">[10:40:00]</a>. Girls are not oblivious to these tactics; they notice when a man acts rude or tries to stand out solely to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>.

## How to Avoid Competing

To avoid competition and project confidence, adopt the following behaviors:

### Stay Natural and Calm
When in a group with men and women, maintain a calm and natural demeanor. Imagine there are no girls present and simply enjoy the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. If someone tells a story, resist the urge to immediately jump in and try to tell a better one or be the one to make everyone laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

### Elevate the Value of Other Men
One of the most effective ways to impress women is to genuinely appreciate and elevate the value of other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.
*   If someone tells a joke, laugh heartily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   If someone shares a story, don't try to one-up them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:08:00">[12:08:00]</a>.
*   If another man does something impressive, acknowledge it, clap, laugh, and highlight his value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.

When women observe a man who doesn't compete and instead displays genuine appreciation for others, they perceive him as confident and not [[the_dangers_of_seeking_approval_from_women|needing anyone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. For example, if a man tells a joke and others don't react due to an atmosphere of competition, but you laugh hard, the women will often follow suit and you'll become the center of attention, even without having told the joke yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

### Don't Be Jealous
If you see a woman you like interacting with another man, do not ask her about him or try to learn details about their interaction. Simply disregard it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>.

### Introduce Her to a More Handsome Friend
For an advanced technique that can profoundly impress a woman, consider introducing her to a friend who is objectively better looking than you, especially if you are dating or in a relationship with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. This act demonstrates an exceptionally high level of self-confidence and a complete lack of jealousy, leading her to think about you frequently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:00">[12:54:00]</a>. When they meet, ensure you never display any signs of jealousy or fear that he might take her from you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>.

By adopting these principles, a man projects confidence and detachment, ensuring he is never ignored because he never gave the woman the opportunity to ignore him in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

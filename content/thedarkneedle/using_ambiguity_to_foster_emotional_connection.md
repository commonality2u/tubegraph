To attract a woman from scratch, a three-step plan can be employed, with each step building upon the last <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach focuses on using ambiguity to create psychological intrigue and emotional engagement, ultimately leading her to pursue you.

## Step 1: Make Her Surrender to Your Emotional Frame
This step utilizes the "You're Trouble" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Most men approach women trying to be liked, appearing safe, friendly, and attractive, with their energy signaling, "Please think I'm good enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. Women are accustomed to this dynamic and expect to control the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The "You're Trouble" technique disrupts this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.

The phrase "You're Trouble" labels her, but in a way that takes away her power rather than giving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Delivered calmly and confidently, it puts her on the defensive by subtly implying she is dangerous and that you should be careful with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This shifts the dynamic from "I hope she likes me" to her needing to prove she's not chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Women often crave men who see through their usual patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. By signaling "I see your game and I'm not playing it," you disarm her and force her to recalibrate, interrupting her social autopilot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

### Creating Psychological Intrigue
The phrase "You're Trouble" is open-ended; it doesn't specify what kind of trouble she is (seductive, toxic, playful) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This ambiguity creates a [[creating_psychological_intrigue_in_relationships | psychological itch]] that her brain tries to fill in, making her want to know what you meant and how you see her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. She cannot regain control of the frame because you give her nothing to hold onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

When she starts defending herself or trying to shape your perception, she has already lost the frame and is now doing the chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. Her attention becomes locked on your opinion of her, placing her inside your [[emotional_framing_techniques_for_attraction | emotional frame]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

#### Application of "You're Trouble"
The technique is applied in two stages:
1.  **Early in Conversation (5-10 minutes):** Use it when she flirts too easily, smiles like she's done it many times, asks too many questions, or acts performatively innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Deliver it calmly with a smirk, then remain silent and let her deal with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>. It can also be used as a pattern interrupt when she expects a compliment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This forces her to adjust in real-time, revealing her authentic self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.
    *   If she pushes back, she is trying to defend her image, which indicates your words have pierced the surface, leading to [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | emotional investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
    *   If she plays along, you've given her a new identity, one she will feel around you and that shapes her behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Later in Conversation (Reuse):** Repeat the phrase quietly and calmly when she reveals something unhinged or her true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. After the second time, she may internalize the label and even start calling herself "trouble," signaling emotional surrender to your frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

## Step 2: Keep the Chase Going by Creating Craving
This step employs the "I like this, whatever this is" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Once she starts opening up, leaning in, or trying to show her depth, this phrase can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. It emotionally rewards her while keeping her [[creating_mystery_and_anticipation_in_dating | chasing clarity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. You plant the idea that something special is happening but then pull away before she can grasp it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

By saying "I like this," you show warmth and [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotion]], but by adding "whatever this is," you refuse to define the relationship, creating [[creating_mixed_emotions_in_a_relationship | emotional tension]] instead of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. This mix of warmth and confusion creates an [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotional cocktail]] that can lead to obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>. You hint at a deep [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | connection]] but deny clarity, leaving her brain stuck in a loop asking, "What is this?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. This psychological loop can become addictive, taking over her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

### Application of "I like this, whatever this is"
This line should be earned, not thrown out randomly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>. The ideal moment is when the emotional tension is built up, not yet romantic but undeniably charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>.

It is delivered in a moment of natural intimacy, such as after a shared laugh or when she opens up and shares something vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. The delivery is crucial: it should seem like it just slipped out, as if you were surprised by your own honesty but too composed to make a big deal of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. The goal is to make her feel something, then pull away before she gets [[emotional_safety_in_relationships | emotional closure]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. This "warm and cold" energy, combined with subtle detachment, makes the line powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.

When done correctly, she may not respond directly but will replay the moment in her head later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. This uncertainty makes her want to escape it, and you become the person who can resolve it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## Step 3: Turn Confusion into Ownership
This final step introduces the line: "You already act like my girl sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

This statement assigns her the girlfriend role partially, creating tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>. It implies that she is already behaving like someone who is [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotionally attached]] without the title, exposing something she might not have meant to admit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. Her mind races, wondering if she acts that way, and if she enters a mild emotional spiral reflecting on her behavior, she's already in the trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

If she pushes back, she creates internal tension by denying something that feels true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>. If she agrees, even jokingly, she confirms her attachment and steps directly into the frame you've given her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. You are not asking her to be your girlfriend, but rather observing that she has slipped into that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>. Her brain will scan past behavior to confirm this observation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. If she starts playing into it (e.g., being more nurturing or consistent), she feels like she's just following through on who she already is, unaware that you've influenced this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>.

### Application of "You already act like my girl sometimes"
This line should be delivered after she exhibits some form of [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | emotional behavior]] that resembles girlfriend behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>. It is said like a calm observation, with a slight, playful smirk, not seriously or needily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. The goal is for the statement to land heavily despite not being meant deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   If she gets annoyed when you don't reply, smile, shake your head slowly, and say, "You already act like my girl sometimes," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>.
*   If she does something nurturing or domestic (e.g., folds your shirt, brings food), look at her with amused disbelief and say, "You're aware you're acting like my girl right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

The tone is key: teasing, but with an undeniable truth beneath it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. Once she starts defending, joking, or playing into it, the frame has landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. She begins to think about her role in your life and may start using "we" or "already," indicating she has accepted the label in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

### Conclusion of the Three-Step Plan
*   **Phrase one** ("You're Trouble") creates tension by unbalancing her ego <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.
*   **Phrase two** ("I like this, whatever this is") creates a bond by confusing her emotions and creating craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
*   **Phrase three** ("You already act like my girl sometimes") gives her the illusion of choice, leading her to internalize the role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:00">[11:09:00]</a>.

By using these three techniques, you create an [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional loop]] that she doesn't realize she's stepping into, leading her to eventually call herself yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

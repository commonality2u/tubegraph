To genuinely attract someone, particularly women, it's crucial to understand how to listen effectively and demonstrate empathy [00:08:32]. The goal is to shift her perception from you trying to "win her over" to her feeling like she is winning you over [00:09:27]. This approach allows for a deeper [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | connection]] [00:10:38].

## The Importance of Listening
When a woman is speaking, your primary objective is to remove the idea from her mind that you are merely trying to win her over [00:08:46]. Often, a person trying to win someone over will rush to interrupt, constantly look for chances to talk about themselves, and try to force their way into the conversation [00:08:56]. While talking is acceptable, it's essential to listen when she speaks [00:09:18].

## How to Listen in a Way That Makes Her Think About You
The key to effective listening is to make her feel as though she is winning you over [00:09:29]. This can be achieved through a set of simple, actionable steps [00:09:32].

### 1. Get the Whole Message First
Do not rush to respond when she speaks [00:09:36]. Instead, sit back, relax, and let her finish her thoughts completely [00:09:38]. Many men tend to get excited by something she says and interrupt to show they understand her, which can come across as trying too hard and is unattractive [00:09:44].

### 2. Amplify
Amplifying means reinforcing what she has said and showing her that you understand her [00:09:55].
> [!example] Example
> If she tells you she spent the afternoon at the beach enjoying the fresh air and calm waves, you could respond with: "Isn't it amazing how just sitting by the ocean can make you feel so calm and free?" [00:10:00]
By doing this, you amplify the positive emotions she felt during the experience, making her feel them even more while she is talking to you [00:10:11].

### 3. Echoing
Echoing involves rephrasing her words in your own way, rather than repeating them exactly [00:10:17].
> [!example] Example
> If she talks about a fun, refreshing trip she took with friends out of town, you could respond with: "Yeah, sometimes just getting out of the city and leaving everything behind for a while feels so refreshing" [00:10:23].
This demonstrates that you truly [[understanding_and_recognizing_emotional_states | understand her feelings]] and helps [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | connect]] with her on a deeper level [00:10:34].

### 4. Empathy
Empathy means conveying "I understand how you felt" without explicitly saying it [00:10:40]. You achieve this by mentioning the emotions you imagine she felt in a situation, rather than commenting on the situation itself [00:10:46].
> [!example] Example
> If she tells you she was stuck at the airport for hours due to a canceled flight, causing her to miss an important event, avoid saying: "Wow, what a terrible airline!" [00:10:52]. Instead, say: "You must have felt so frustrated just sitting there knowing there was nothing you could do about it" [00:11:00].
This approach focuses on her feelings, making her feel truly understood [00:11:07]. Another way to show empathy is by commenting on her passion for something [00:11:14]. For instance, if she enthusiastically discusses photography, you could say: "You really have a deep love for photography, don't you?" [00:11:18]. This highlights that you notice her emotions, not just the information she provides [00:11:25].

### 5. Captioning
Captioning involves bringing up things she mentioned earlier in the conversation [00:11:29]. This technique works particularly well with humor [00:11:37].
> [!example] Example
> If she previously mentioned a terrifying yet thrilling skydiving experience, and later expresses nervousness about a job interview, you could say: "Come on, you jumped out of a plane; how scary can a job interview be?" [00:11:40].
This shows that you were paying attention earlier and reminds her of a positive experience she associates with herself [00:11:57]. People appreciate it when others remember details about their lives, especially things they are proud of [00:12:04].

By applying these listening techniques – getting the whole message, amplifying, echoing, showing empathy, and captioning – you transition from being just a listener to being someone who genuinely understands her [00:12:08]. This deep understanding is what will make her think about you long after the conversation ends [00:12:34].

To influence others, whether in general persuasion or attraction, two steps are essential: first, get inside their mind, and second, choose the right words to influence their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This process can be applied when trying to attract or win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Building Connection

The fastest way to enter someone's inner mind is by building a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. This means deliberately [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | creating a match]] or "instant bond" with another person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is easier to convince someone with whom you have a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

A significant part of how the brain unconsciously processes information about people is non-verbal, including facial expressions and body language (e.g., how a person sits, walks, and moves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Link Between Body and Mood

Making a connection is based on the idea that your body's actions affect your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. You can assess how others are feeling by observing their body and facial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. If you then copy their movements, you might begin to feel similarly, due to the link between your body and your mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Mood Demonstration

To demonstrate this, consider walking with your head up, looking at the sky, and smiling for a few minutes, even if the smile is not genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Then, walk with your head down, looking at the ground, slowing your pace, putting your hands in your pockets, and dragging your feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Notice how your mood changes between these two postures, without any conscious thought of happy or sad things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This shows that posture directly affects mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

## Entering Someone Else's Mind

Since changing your posture affects your mood, copying someone else's posture can help you feel what they feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This serves as a way to enter their mind and [[understanding_and_recognizing_emotional_states | understand their mood]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Adjusting Your Mood to Others'

To understand someone else's mood, adjust your own mood to match theirs, creating a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. After observing their posture, pause to define the mood you've noticed (e.g., bored, happy, sad, curious, enthusiastic, calm, nervous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Once you've named both your mood and theirs, you can adjust as needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## How to Change Someone's Mood

To practice, choose a pleasant person with whom you have no serious connection (e.g., a cashier, neighbor, or someone in an elevator) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

1.  **Read the person**: Use their body language to define their mood (e.g., happy, sad, disoriented, angry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
2.  **Immerse yourself in that mood**: Use inner dialogue to repeatedly think of the word defining the mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Ensure your thoughts align with the desired mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Recall past memories where you felt that way, remembering images, feelings, and sounds, to truly experience the mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
3.  **Approach and maintain the mood**: Speak normally, keeping your mood consistent until you are both on the same emotional wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. Continue until you make the connection, which you will feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
4.  **Shift their mood**: Once connected, gradually change your gestures, posture, and smile to the mood you want the other person to adopt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Observe their mood changing along with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. This process allows you to influence another person at a subconscious level using nonverbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Adaptation vs. Imitation

There is a significant difference between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. You can adapt to aspects of others' movements subtly without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Do not copy gestures directly, as this is imitation and can lead to embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. The more you practice these [[social_skills_and_emotional_intelligence | skills]], the more proficient you become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Influencing Through Words

Once a connection has been established, you can improve your chances of influencing others by carefully choosing your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It's not just what you say, but *how* you say it, which can have a psychological effect on the subconscious, overcoming refusals and increasing agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Emphasize the Obvious

To make someone believe something is obvious, simply state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
*   "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Ask a Question That Isn't Really a Question

To convince someone's subconscious to agree, state what you want them to agree with and add a question at the end, using a decreasing tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. An increasing tone invites a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
*   "Probably it's time for another drink, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>
*   "My plane is about to take off. There's no problem if I skipped a line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
This approach is generally useful in everyday life but not for major commitments like marriage or sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### Get Them to Say Yes

Encourage agreement by beginning with "Let's" to issue a disguised order, making refusal harder than with "Should we...?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.
*   "Let's walk a bit more" vs. "Should we walk a bit more?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>
*   "Let's go to my place" vs. "Should we go to my place?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
The more someone says yes, the more likely they are to continue agreeing, training their mind to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Save your main request for after they've said yes multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

### "This or That" Choice

Offer two options, both suitable for you, so the choice isn't whether to agree, but *which* option to pick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> (Implies they *will* drink, just not what) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   "Water or wine? Red or white, sir? Still or sparkling?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>

### Anticipate the Future

Tell someone how you expect them to react to something, implying that reaction will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   "I know you'll be thrilled about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   "I know you'll want to repeat the experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you. I know you'll be impressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Logical Leaps

Use "therefore" or "this means that" to connect a true first concept with a second concept you want others to agree with, even if the connection isn't entirely logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   "You're watching this video [true], this means that you like it [maybe true]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   "We've been together for 3 months, therefore I must be serious about this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

### Order and (Another) Order

Give a desired command, then immediately follow it with an easier, definitely-to-be-followed command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The person will focus on the second command but often follow the first without question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
*   "It's late and you're tired. Take out the garbage and come to bed early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   "Come over to my place to have a drink and tell me everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

### "But" Statements

The word "but" emphasizes what follows it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Place the point you want to emphasize *after* "but" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
*   "He is always late to work, but he's good at what he's doing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a> (Emphasizes his competence).
*   "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly to new environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

### The Ideal Question

Using words like "ideal" or "ideally" makes others imagine perfect scenarios, prompting them to tell the truth about what they truly want rather than what they think is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This provides crucial information for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   "What do you ideally want?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>
*   "What would be the ideal result?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>
In a job interview, asking "Ideally, what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" prompts a description you can then mirror to present yourself as that candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

### Tell It Without Telling It

Express your point of view or give orders by stating what you *don't* want to do, thereby implying what you *do* want the other person to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   "I can't tell you to leave him; the decision must be yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a> (Suggests they should leave him).
*   "I don't want you to worry about me; I'll be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a> (Tells them not to worry).
*   "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a> (Tells them not to pay).

### "Yes Means No" Offers

Offer to do something you don't truly want to do by phrasing it as a conditional possibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   "I could give you a ride home if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   "I could do it if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### "It's Not Important, But It Is"

Use phrases that suggest the advice isn't important or won't be cared for, to deliver feedback that might otherwise be unwelcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
*   "I know that you won't consider my advice, but I'm worried about your unhealthy lifestyle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
*   "Maybe you won't care, but your deodorant is too weak and doesn't last long. Have you thought about keeping one for backup at the office?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:10:00]</a>.

### "I Don't Know If You Realize..."

This is a polite way to tell someone to pay attention and listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
*   "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   "I don't know if you realize how long I've been tolerating this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

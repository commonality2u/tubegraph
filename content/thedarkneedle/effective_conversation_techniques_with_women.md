When talking to women, the problem of running out of things to say is often perceived as a simple issue with a straightforward solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, it's crucial to address this without falling into the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. This article will explain not only how to avoid awkward silences but also the appropriate topics to discuss to ensure an engaging dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Avoid the "Human Questionnaire" Trap

Many men, after [[techniques_for_approaching_women_in_public | breaking the ice with a woman]], tend to become "human questionnaires," bombarding her with mundane "get to know you" inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. This relentless interrogation bores her and prevents genuine engagement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. They often leap from one question to the next, failing to expand on topics she clearly enjoys discussing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

### Follow Up with Statements

Instead of racing to the next question, follow up her answer with a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This demonstrates that you are actively listening and can connect on a deeper level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This approach opens the conversation to more fun or intimate topics, turning a monotonous Q&A into an [[creating_engaging_conversations_with_women | engaging dialogue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

> For example, if she says she has three cats, you could respond: "Ah, so you're one of those cat people, huh?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> This injects banter and expands the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

## Qualify Her to Build Interest

Once a man senses rapport, he may cling to safe topics to avoid shattering the connection, which often bores a previously interested woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Take the Role of Selector

Begin [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | qualifying her]] by making statements that might playfully "disqualify" her as a potential partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This creates a playful dynamic where she feels compelled to prove herself to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This technique was also discussed in the [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | how to attract women]] series <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

> Building on the pet example, if she says she has three cats, you could say: "Hmm, we would never get along. I'm a dog person, and I've heard that dog and cat owners tend to have a really intense sexual connection but disagree on every other possible point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. This steers the conversation into intriguing territory with a hint of sexuality, challenging her and shifting the burden of approval onto her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

## Go Beyond Surface-Level Facts

Men often discuss facts, events, and amusing surface-level stories, which make for good small talk but don't ignite passion in a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Women are more interested in the mystical or deeper emotional meanings behind facts and stories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

### Use Cold Reading

Employ "cold reading" to delve beneath the surface and encourage her to express her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A cold read involves stating an observation about her and then making a deeper interpretation about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

> For instance, if she mentions a previous date, you could say: "I can tell just by the way you're talking that you're the kind of girl who goes on a lot of dates but has trouble finding someone you're actually interested in. Then when you find that person, you usually lose interest very quickly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This allows you to explore emotional realms and present yourself as someone new and exciting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Emphasize Your Passions

Many men default to "interview mode" topics like work and school, failing to show their passionate and excited side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Women often seek men who are passionate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Share What Drives You

Emphasize the things you are passionate and enthusiastic about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Passion can transform a mundane subject, like cooking, into an engrossing conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Whether it's travel, building a business, or an interest in music, art, or movies, let your drive shine through without bragging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Women are attracted to men with drive who know what they want and pursue it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.

## Keep the Conversation Playful

When approaching a beautiful woman, many men place her on a pedestal, becoming overly cautious about offending her, which causes the conversation to fizzle out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. As previously discussed in the [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | how to attract women]] series, women desire a guy who is fun to be around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. People generally want to relax, laugh, and have a good time on a date or at a bar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

### Embrace Playful Teasing

The purpose of teasing is to create a fun and relaxed environment where a woman can open up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Teasing involves being silly and treating her like a playful younger sister, picking on her in a fun and flirtatious manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This requires dropping your "cool guy" image and being a little goofy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

> Examples of playful teasing include:
> *   Pretending to give a high-five then pulling your hand away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
> *   Playfully imitating her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
> *   Suggesting she's coming on to you, like "Whoa, slow down there, at least buy me dinner first" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
> *   Telling an exaggerated lie and teasing her for believing it, "Wait, you actually thought I have a pet dragon?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

These techniques, similar to playground interactions, are more effective and fun than discussing mundane topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Seamlessly Transition Between Topics

Running out of things to talk about often stems from two issues: an inability to smoothly change conversational threads and not providing enough new threads for the woman to latch onto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Men frequently miss new conversation topics because they're too focused on what they'll say next instead of listening to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Offer Multiple Conversational Threads

Always try to present her with several different topics she can grasp when constructing your sentences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

> For example, instead of just saying "I love baseball," which limits the conversation, say: "I love baseball because when I was young my father used to take me to games and now that I'm older I feel a real sense of nostalgia toward it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This gives her options: she can talk about her dad, childhood memories, or things that evoke nostalgia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
>
> Similarly, if she says: "I love to cook. My mom taught me how to cook and now I even find myself watching those cooking shows on TV," you can respond: "Yeah, I'm the same way with those travel shows on TV. I start watching them and get sucked into all the amazing locations. So where would you go on vacation if money wasn't a factor?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a> This demonstrates how to easily transition to a new topic by improvising off a single word like "TV" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. This is like playing a conversational game of jazz, where improvisation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

## Anchor Positive Emotions

Many men mistakenly believe beautiful women don't want to talk to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. However, beautiful women crave fun and flirtatious conversations because few men know how to pique their interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. The main reasons men struggle to communicate well are nervousness that hides their fun side, and speaking in a way women don't respond to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

Women differ from men as they enjoy discussing the meaning behind actions and the emotions they evoke <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Crucially, the emotions evoked during a conversation will subconsciously anchor them to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. If you discuss negative experiences, she will associate those bad feelings with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

### Prompt Positive Emotional States

Just as negative feelings can be anchored, so can positive ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. It's vital to draw her into a positive emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. One way is through teasing, as discussed earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. Another is to ask questions and make statements that encourage her to talk about specific positive feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

> For example, if she mentions snowboarding, instead of asking about facts like mountains or equipment, get her to talk about the feelings she experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
>
> If she says: "Yeah, I went snowboarding. I had the best time," you could respond: "Wow, I love snowboarding! I think I'm literally addicted to the rush I get going down the mountain. What about you, what excites you most about snowboarding?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>
>
> This shifts the focus to the positive emotions of adventure, excitement, and feeling truly alive, subconsciously anchoring these feelings to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

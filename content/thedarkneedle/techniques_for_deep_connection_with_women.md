To foster a deep connection and attract women, the key is to speak to their emotions, not just their minds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach helps a man move from being categorized as just a friend to a potential boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

This technique is the quickest way to engage a woman's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It involves asking emotional questions and listening to the answers as a therapist would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Understanding Emotional Communication

When interacting with a woman, her mind quickly categorizes a man into one of three groups: potential boyfriend, friend, or someone she doesn't want to meet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The distinction between a friend and a boyfriend lies in emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. To be seen as a boyfriend, one must know how to stir her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

There are two ways to stir emotions: either feelings are entered into her, or they are brought out of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Initially, it's not possible to "put feelings into her" directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on making her express feelings, which opens the door to her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Consider the difference between logical and emotional communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:
*   **Logical Communication**: Discussing facts or practicalities in a "cold" way (e.g., "What do you study?" - "Computer science") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This type of conversation is easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **Emotional Communication**: Asking "why" she likes or dislikes something, prompting her to express her internal feelings (e.g., "Do you like this field?" - "Why?") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This makes her talk more and express deeper feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

### Crafting Emotional Questions

Emotional questions are designed to make a woman [[encouraging_women_to_invest_emotionally_in_conversations | express her feelings]]â€”whether anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, or passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. It's crucial to understand the concept behind emotional questions rather than just memorizing a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

When asking an emotional question, the goal is for her answer to be long and expressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. If she gives a short answer (e.g., "Yes, of course"), always follow up by asking "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This prompts her to elaborate and share her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.

### Turning Questions into Emotional Conversation

The emotional question is merely a key to unlock a larger emotional conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Once she starts sharing her story and expressing herself:
1.  **Listen Carefully**: Try to get her to express herself as much as possible, listening without interrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This engages her emotions, the "instinct responsible for love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.
2.  **Transition Emotionally**: As she talks, identify emotional cues and transition from one emotional topic to another, always focusing on letting her talk about things that stir her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
3.  **Avoid "Interview Mode"**: Do not simply ask a series of unrelated questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Questions should be related and build upon each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.
4.  **Maintain Talk Ratio**: In a conversation, especially at the beginning, she should be talking approximately 70% of the time, and you only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Always let her talk a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

A conversation where emotions are stirred will remain in her mind for years, unlike a cold, logical one that is quickly forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Examples of Emotional Questions

Social psychology researcher Arthur Aaron created "36 Questions to Fall in Love," a list designed to reveal personal details and behaviors related to intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Experiments showed that participants felt significant attraction after asking these questions, with some even leading to marriage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

The questions are divided into three sets of 12, with intensity gradually increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. Here are the first 10 questions:
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

Remember, the secret is not just having the questions, but knowing how to turn a regular conversation into an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

## How Emotional Engagement Leads to Intimacy

A personal anecdote illustrates the power of emotional connection:
A man was dating a woman who was not interested in immediate sexual intimacy. During a date at his place, he suggested taking an MBTI personality test. As he asked her the test questions, he encouraged her to elaborate and share stories about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Before they finished the test, they became intimate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

This story highlights two key lessons:
1.  **Emotional Trigger for Women's Desire**: For men, sexual desire is often visually triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. For women, sexual desire arises when they start experiencing emotions, especially if you are the reason for those emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
2.  **Creativity in Application**: Don't simply ask questions robotically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Be creative in how you implement these techniques to facilitate genuine emotional sharing.

### Avoiding the "Therapy Zone"

While this technique is powerful, applying it in isolation can lead to being placed in the "therapy zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. It's essential to integrate this method with other [[effective_communication_strategies_with_women | effective communication strategies]] and techniques for [[effective_communication_with_women | effective communication with women]] learned in broader social skills development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

This approach for creating deep and memorable connections is not limited to romantic interactions; it can also be used to build stronger bonds with people in general <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

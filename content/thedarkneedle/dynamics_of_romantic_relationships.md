The advice to "let the woman chase you" is commonly heard, yet often seems impossible to achieve in reality, with many women stating they would never chase anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. However, a woman is naturally drawn to the man she is pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. [[Understanding the dynamics of dating | Understanding the dynamics of dating]] in this context involves two distinct types of chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Types of Chasing

### Logical Chasing
Logical chasing occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear benefit she perceives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. For instance, if a man is wealthy or holds high status, she might think a relationship with him would provide financial gain, gifts, and a comfortable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. She then chases him because it aligns with her interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

However, logical chasing has two major drawbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
1.  **Rarity and Difficulty**: Achieving extreme wealth or high status is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Most people do not possess these qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.
2.  **Lack of Meaningful Connection**: This type of pursuit rarely leads to a strong, meaningful relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. While a woman might show excitement over financial success, her interest is in the money, not the man himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. She might stay, but will likely seek someone else to fulfill her core emotional needs that money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This pursuit is not in the best interest of a man seeking a genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

### Emotional Chasing
Emotional chasing happens when a woman pursues a man due to her genuine feelings and love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions are beyond her control, as she cannot stand being away from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This form of chasing cultivates love, makes the relationship enjoyable, and contributes to its longevity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A woman will not truly love or develop deep feelings for a man unless this emotional chasing takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>.

## Stages of a Relationship
Romantic relationships, particularly regarding emotional chasing, involve two main stages: the hunting stage and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. These stages form the foundation for creating emotional chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### The Hunting Stage
This phase is defined by the man taking initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. As a man, your role in the dating market is to be the "chooser," selecting the girl you desire and initiating contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This includes initiating conversations, taking the first step, and asking her out on a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

#### Asking for a Date: Hunter vs. Follower
While taking initiative, it is crucial not to *chase* her like a follower, but to operate as a hunter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This distinction is subtle but impactful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>:
*   **Follower Questions**: Asking "When can I see you?" or "When are you free?" puts the decision in her court, essentially saying, "You lead, and I'll follow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Hunter Statements**: Instead, tell her what you're going to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. Examples include:
    *   "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever, you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>
    *   "Message me, I've got a fun idea." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>
    *   "Put your number in my phone, let's stay in touch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>
    *   "We should grab a drink the next time we're both free. Let me know what your week looks like." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>

A woman desires a man who knows what to do and confidently acts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The more confident you are in leading, the more comfortable she will be following you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

If she declines a date with an excuse (e.g., "I have to meet a friend on Sunday"), do not suggest alternative days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Simply respond with "All right, no problem, let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

#### Communication During Hunting
After a date, do not immediately text or call her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Take a step back for a week, then message her again to suggest another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Maintain this system of initiating contact once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If she messages you first during this phase, it is fine to respond, but the key is that *you* only initiate contact once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

#### Date Conduct
During a date, your primary goal is to **increase the emotional energy of the interaction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.

*   **Punctuality**: Do not wait more than 10 minutes for a late date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. If she's more than 10 minutes late, leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. This demonstrates you have other important things in your life and teaches her not to take you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. While some advise intentionally showing up late to make her chase you, being on time is generally better, as modern women are more perceptive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
*   **Conversation**: Focus on topics that have an [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Avoid generic questions like "What do you do for work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Instead, ask questions that emotionally resonate with her, such as:
    *   "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   "If you were guaranteed not to fail, what would you want to become?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    *   "Who is the person you care about the most in your life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
    The key is to trigger her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Kiss Test**: When the conversation reaches a high level of [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional involvement]], perform a kiss test to see if she is ready for a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. An emotionally charged girl typically will not refuse a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Ending the Date**: End the date when the conversation is at its peak and you are both having a great time, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Leave without explicitly promising another date to maintain an air of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Continue to give her space and let her think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### The Chasing Stage
You know you've transitioned to the chasing phase when the girl starts messaging you daily, calling you, and consistently wanting to meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This indicates she's developed feelings and is starting to like you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

At this point, you should **not always be available** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. If she calls, don't always answer. If she asks to meet, sometimes tell her you're busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Making yourself constantly available once a girl becomes attached can lead to her quickly getting bored and her feelings cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. To maintain a long-lasting and enjoyable relationship, she needs to chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

This distancing strategy should only be applied once the girl is already attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Distancing yourself too early, before she has developed feelings, will cause her to lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

This approach is not manipulative; it's about providing the challenge and [[Power dynamics and respect in romantic relationships | power dynamics and respect in romantic relationships]] that a woman subconsciously desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. A girl wants a man who challenges her, not one who is overly submissive or follows her every whim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.

Finally, if she distances herself (a common test many girls use to see if you will chase her), stay calm and do not pursue her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. Always remember to "be the hunter, not the chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

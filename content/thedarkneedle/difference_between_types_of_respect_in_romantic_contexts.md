The [[the_psychology_of_respect_in_relationships | psychology of respect]] in romantic relationships differs from general respect. The common phrase "if a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" is true, but the nature of this respect is often misunderstood [00:00:06]. It's not the usual advice like setting boundaries or going to the gym that fosters the specific kind of respect that leads to love and attraction [00:00:19].

## Two Types of Respect
There are primarily two types of respect a woman can feel for a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect**
    This is the respect she might feel for a kind, elderly man or for her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. It's the same kind of respect she has for those who are unfortunately "stuck in the friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This type of respect does not lead to attraction or desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

2.  **Emperor-like Respect**
    This is the respect she might feel for a powerful, inspiring, and impressive figure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Men who command this type of respect are the ones she dreams about and fantasizes about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This is the crucial type of respect that a woman should have for you to foster love and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Building Emperor-like Respect
This type of respect is not built overnight but gradually over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It's about her *wanting* to respect you, rather than you trying to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. It is comprised of two main elements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>:

1.  **[[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | Power]]**
    Having [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | power]] in a relationship means your life remains the same after meeting her as it was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

    *   **Don't Change For Her**
        A woman may unconsciously test you by trying to make you change, especially early in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This could include suggestions about your style, haircut, habits (like smoking), friends, or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If you acquiesce, you lose your [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | power]] and her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Your opinions should also not change because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>.
        To maintain [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | power]], don't change, but also don't argue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Respond calmly with a simple "no" and communicate through your actions rather than justifications or debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Never sacrifice your happiness or something you enjoy for a girl, as this can lead to the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. She should never be the reason for your change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

    *   **[[appropriate_times_and_ways_to_apologize_in_relationships | Stop Apologizing Unnecessarily]]**
        Avoid apologizing without reason or for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. If you didn't do anything wrong, don't apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

        *   **When you didn't do anything wrong but she's upset**: Don't apologize. Instead, tease her a little and joke around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
        *   **When you made a small mistake**: If it's an established relationship and you made a minor error (e.g., forgetting a small gift), apologize briefly and then give her space. Don't beg for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
        *   **When you made a big mistake**: For serious mistakes (e.g., cheating), it's acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, such as buying a gift or visiting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

    *   **When She's at Fault**
        *   **Small fault**: Don't show any reaction, anger, or drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
        *   **Medium fault**: Don't get angry, but hold her accountable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. For example, if she cancels a date last minute, you might say, "You're messing up your chances with me," and hang up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If she calls back, set a clear consequence, like demanding an apology letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If she refuses, end contact until she initiates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
        *   **Big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: Do not get angry, but end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Forgiving her in such a situation will cause her to permanently lose respect for you, and she may only stay to exploit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

    *   **[[importance_of_nonreactivity_in_relationships | Maintain Emotional Control]]**
        Never let her get you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. If her actions make you react, it indicates she controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Even if she says nasty things, remain calm and non-reactive, like "The Rock in the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Girls often test your reaction to extreme situations; reacting predictably means failing the test and losing your [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | power]] and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

2.  **Fear (the enjoyable kind)**
    This is a subtle form of fear that a woman actually enjoys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. It is tied to the principle: **investment equals attraction equals respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

    *   **Her Investment, Not Yours**
        A common mistake men make is investing heavily in a woman (e.g., expensive dates, gifts), believing this will win her over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This often leads to the friend zone while she pursues men who put in less effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
        The key is that it's *her* investment in *you* that counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The more you chase and try to impress her, the more she occupies your thoughts, but her feelings won't change if she isn't investing in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
        You need to reverse the situation: the more she invests in you, the more attracted she will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. You should invest enough to make her comfortable investing in you, then let her take the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

    *   **Fear of Loss**
        As she starts to invest time, effort, and money in you, her fear of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This is a fundamental human principle: the more we invest in something, the more we fear losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
        This fear of losing you is the second key component of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. When [[understanding_power_dynamics_in_dating | power]] and this enjoyable fear combine, no woman will dare to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

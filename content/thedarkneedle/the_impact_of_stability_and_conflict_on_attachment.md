True intelligence and strength in relationships involve making a woman deeply invested in you, causing her to dream about you, think about you, and even suffer when you are not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. A key factor in making a person [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | obsessively attached]] to their partner is the amount of [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotional investment]] they put into the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

To foster this deep investment, two "weapons" are essential:
1.  Readiness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  Creating a [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | cocktail of mixed emotions]] throughout the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Readiness to Walk Away

Having an independent life is crucial to being ready to leave a relationship at any moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. Without a personal life, your days can be monotonous, making time spent with a new partner the most enjoyable part of your day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This can lead to becoming overly attached, clingy, and forgiving even when your partner crosses boundaries, because you feel you cannot lose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This dynamic causes a partner's respect for you to decrease, potentially leading to a breakup that leaves you emotionally shattered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

Conversely, having an exciting personal life, filled with friends, sports, and challenges, makes a relationship an addition to an already great life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. In this state, you are prepared to walk away when boundaries are crossed, signaling to your partner that certain behaviors are unacceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. This approach makes it clear that the relationship is to enhance your life, not to be tolerated if disrespect or disobedience occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

## The Emotion Cocktail: Blending Stability and Conflict

To ensure a partner's unique emotional experience with you, the relationship should resemble a movie story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. The film industry uses a powerful psychological pattern to trigger emotions and create deep attachment, involving periods of normalcy followed by problems, escalation, resolution, and a return to normalcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This pattern, applied to a relationship, makes you the center of her world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

The "emotion cocktail" formula consists of:
*   **Periods of Stability**: Where both partners feel love and a pleasant routine, engaging in conversations, outings, and calls, making the girl feel safe and secure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **A "Quake"**: A sudden event that shakes up her world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Magical Reconciliation**: An immediate and cinematic resolution after the quake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.

### Example: Paul and Luna's Story

Paul and Luna's two-month relationship started with Luna being attracted to Paul's honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

*   **Stability**: An evening together, talking and laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Quake**: Paul told Luna unbelievable, made-up stories and insisted they were real, causing Luna to feel betrayed and frustrated when she later found out he lied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. She ended a call, unable to focus on her studies due to her anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This introduced [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | tension or insecurity]] into their otherwise stable dynamic.
*   **Magical Reconciliation**: The next day, Paul appeared at her university lecture, presented her with earrings she had wanted, and a note apologizing and promising never to lie again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. This cinematic apology resolved the situation and made Luna trust and believe him even more than before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

This pattern, where a "quake" is followed by a "magical reconciliation," strengthens attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Another Example: The Tattoo

Consider a stable phase followed by a conflict and separation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. During the separation, you meet another person a few times, and upon reconciling with your girlfriend, you admit this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. This admission creates anxiety and insecurity (the "quake") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. The "magical reconciliation" could involve getting her name tattooed on your forearm, sending her a picture, letting her touch it, and blocking the other person you met, letting her discover it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. The stronger the "quake," the more powerful the reconciliation needs to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Shifting Reconciliation Dynamics

Initially, especially if you orchestrated the "quake," you should be the one to reconcile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. However, once your girlfriend becomes [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | deeply attached]] to you, you can create the "quake" and let her initiate the reconciliation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For instance, if she ignores your messages, confront her in front of her friends, raise your voice, and then leave as if the relationship is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. When she realizes you're not making the first move, she will return to make amends herself, shifting the power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

By applying these methods, it becomes impossible for a girl to consider leaving you or seeking another partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

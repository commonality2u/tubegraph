Making someone laugh is identified as one of the fastest ways to attract a person, regardless of who they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:77">[00:04:77]</a>.

## The Power of Laughter in Attraction

Making a girl laugh is one of the best ways to accelerate [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:28">[04:13:28]</a>. This is described as a natural instinct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:84">[04:16:84]</a>. The principle of "Opposites Attract" also applies to laughter: men are attracted to women who laugh at their jokes, and women are attracted to men who make them laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:43">[04:29:43]</a>.

When a woman laughs at a man's words, he may feel an intense rush of happiness and become strongly attracted to her, even if he wasn't interested before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:16">[04:46:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:49">[04:56:49]</a>. This happens subconsciously; a man naturally feels attracted to a girl who laughs at his jokes, even if he wouldn't normally find her attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:29">[05:02:29]</a>.

For women, the attraction to a man who can make them laugh is described as ten times stronger than a man's attraction to a woman who laughs at his jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:07">[05:19:07]</a>. Laughter is presented as the fastest way to a woman's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:26">[05:30:26]</a>.

## Humor as a Learned Skill

A sense of humor is not something innate; if someone is not naturally funny, it does not mean they lack the ability to be so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:07">[05:42:07]</a>. Being funny is a learned skill that can be developed through study, reading, and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:15">[05:49:15]</a>.

## Techniques for Making Her Laugh

### Misinterpretation and Speculation

One of the easiest and fastest techniques to make a girl laugh is "misinterpretation and speculation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:40">[06:41:40]</a>. This technique is commonly used in romantic comedies and often makes women laugh more than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:85">[06:51:85]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:42">[06:57:42]</a>.

To apply this technique, listen to what the girl says and find something to misinterpret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:05">[07:06:05]</a>. The most effective misinterpretations are sexual, but they can also make her seem:
*   Naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:48">[07:14:48]</a>
*   Obsessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:93">[07:15:93]</a>
*   Trying to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:79">[07:16:79]</a>
*   Paranoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:34">[07:17:34]</a>
*   Dorky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:02">[07:18:02]</a>
*   Like a cute little puppy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:93">[07:19:93]</a>

The formula for this technique is to misinterpret, then exaggerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:92">[07:54:92]</a>. For example, if a girl mentions her "girlfriend," you can misinterpret it as a romantic partner and ask, "Oh, you have a girlfriend? That's so cool that you're open-minded like that. Do you have more than one? Do they get jealous?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. If you are not naturally funny, you can simply misinterpret without exaggerating and allow her to laugh and correct you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:05">[07:58:05]</a>.

Another approach is to speculate about why she says or does something. For instance, if she calls out a pickup line you used, you could speculate, "Oh, are you saying that because no one usually talks to you? Oh, that's so cute" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:49">[08:21:49]</a>.

## Rules for Delivering Jokes

When telling a joke, avoid laughing before the other person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:27">[08:46:27]</a>. It's better not to laugh at your own jokes at all than to fill silence with laughter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:83">[09:00:83]</a>. A simple "yeah, I got you" smile is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:47">[09:04:47]</a>.

If a joke doesn't land, never explain it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:14">[09:14:14]</a>. Explaining a joke that wasn't funny makes you look bad and creates an awkward situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:99">[09:24:99]</a>. If she didn't understand it, explaining it will make it impossible for her to find it funny afterwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:64">[09:34:64]</a>. A key element of a good joke is its unexpected timing, which is lost upon explanation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:33">[09:42:33]</a>. If she says "I didn't get it," simply say nothing and move on to another topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:84">[09:52:84]</a>.

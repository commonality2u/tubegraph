This article delves into psychological secrets designed to make individuals not only like and admire you, but also become obsessed with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The information presented can be used to become a central figure in your environment or to manipulate others to fulfill your needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Distinguishing Liking from Obsession

While making someone like you is a common social skill, making someone obsessed, addicted, and eagerly awaiting the next interaction requires a specific skill: [[triggering_weak_points | triggering weak points]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Triggering Weak Points

Every person possesses four weak points, with at least one being significantly stronger in 99% of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The key is to identify and utilize this weak point to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

### Detecting Weak Points

To discover a person's weak point, first learn how to detect it during a conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Human behavior typically follows a straight line, but occasionally experiences "spikes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A spike indicates you've hit a sensitive nerve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

A "spike" is a significant increase in emotional response, noticeable when a person's tone of voice, speech speed, or attention deviates from their normal state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. This can occur when you make them laugh or introduce a captivating topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Another indicator is when they repeat a phrase or sentence twice, often because they didn't receive their desired reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

If these behavioral spikes or repetitions are directly related to them personally, you may have found an "opening" or "gap in their defenses" which represents an internal deficiency they subconsciously wish to have filled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

### Types of Weak Points

Once you recognize these weak points, you can identify the void a person experiences simply by listening to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

#### 1. Thirst for Validation

Some individuals have an excessive need for validation, constantly trying to prove their specialness and seeking admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They might frequently discuss achievements, impressive stories, or romantic conquests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This type of person often enjoys feeling in control of their social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

*   **Exploitation:** The "bait" for this weak point is praise, but it must be given indirectly to affect their subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Direct compliments are ineffective and can make you seem disingenuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

    *   **Indirect Praise through Seeking Advice:** Ask for their advice on a problem (real or made-up). When they provide a solution, respond with admiration, such as, "Wow, you're absolutely right! I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This makes them feel intellectually superior and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
    *   **Indirect Praise through Third-Party Mention:** If they mention an achievement, like running 6 miles, do not react immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Wait for them to ask why you're interested. Then, say something like, "The other day Henry and I were talking about you, and we were debating whether you could run 6 miles without stopping. He told me 6 miles is a really big number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This makes them feel validated and appreciated because they were talked about by others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   **Indirect Praise through Joking:** Joke about something they are proud of <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. For example, if they are tall, ask "How's the weather up there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. If they impress a romantic interest, joke about it later, like "Dude, how did you even pull that off?" while laughing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. This reinforces their pride points in a fun way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Individuals with a thirst for validation are often the easiest to manipulate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

#### 2. Fear of Failure

People pursuing significant, life-changing goals (e.g., competitive university, difficult job) often experience an internal voice reminding them of potential failure, despite external encouragement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Filling this "hole" of fear makes you indispensable to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

*   **Exploitation:** The "bait" is emotional reassurance and lifting their spirits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   **Avoid Giving Unsolicited Advice:** Most people tend to offer solutions or advice when someone discusses their problems, but this is often unhelpful unless specifically requested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. People usually know the obvious solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   **Different Scenarios for Problems:**
        *   **[[seeking_advice_versus_seeking_approval | Seeking Advice]]:** If they directly ask for your opinion or guidance, help them find a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
        *   **Venting:** If they are sharing a past problem or a situation with no immediate solution, simply listen without offering solutions or changing the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
        *   **Emotional Problems:** If the problem is emotional, like stress or uncertainty about the future, reassurance is the correct approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   **Providing Hope:** Listen silently as they express their fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Once they finish, offer hope by telling stories of others who were in similar or worse situations but still succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. For example, share a story of a relative who achieved success despite facing similar challenges and exhaustion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. These stories can be real or fabricated, depending on your principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

#### 3. Psychological Trauma

Psychological traumas are varied, but a common one among young men is the feeling of inadequacy after romantic rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Rejection can make a man feel there's something wrong with his appearance, personality, or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

*   **Exploitation:** Indirectly convince him that the problem lies with the woman or that he is superior to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
    *   **If Single:** Share "facts" about the woman that make it clear the issue is hers, not his. For example, mention she had a long, failed relationship or that another successful man also faced rejection from her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.
    *   **If In a Relationship:** Praise his current partner by comparing her favorably to the one who rejected him (e.g., "The girl you're with now is so much better than the one who rejected you; she has a better personality, she looks better") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. This increases his self-value and helps him realize the rejection was meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

#### 4. Thirst for Sex (for Women to Exploit Men)

This weak point cannot be exploited by men but is crucial for men to understand to protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Women can use a man's [[emotional_versus_logical_chasing_in_relationships | thirst for sex]] to manipulate him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. A woman holds the power to make a man chase her indefinitely without fully giving in, only offering small "tastes" when he is about to give up, thereby ensuring he continues to chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## The Addiction Principle

Hitting a person's weak points is like giving them a drug; its effect eventually wears off, causing their brain to crave more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. Their brain associates this "drug" with you, leading them to subconsciously desire more interaction and become addicted without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

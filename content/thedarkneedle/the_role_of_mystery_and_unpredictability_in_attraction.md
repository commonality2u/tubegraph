To foster deep [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction | psychological dynamics of attraction]] and make a woman obsessed, addicted, and loving, the key element is "drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Drama, in this context, refers to stirring a woman's emotions in a specific way, causing her brain to release love hormones that lead to attachment and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This "recipe" for attraction relies heavily on [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | mystery and unpredictability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Being the Source of Emotion

For attraction to occur, you must be the source of the emotions a woman feels, rather than external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Taking her to a beautiful place or watching an emotional movie will only make her attracted to that external source, not to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. The emotions must be woven into your conversations and interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

## Creating Excitement through Indifference

One way to create excitement is by mixing attention with a touch of indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This involves a pattern where you sometimes compliment and other times critique, but in a way that stirs emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Instead of a straightforward compliment or criticism, combine them to create emotional fluctuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>:
*   **Example 1 (Interest then Indifference):** "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This shows interest without appearing overly eager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.
*   **Example 2 (Indifference then Interest):** "If this dress were pink, it would be better, but still, it looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

Humans tend to remember the last thing said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. By causing an initial dip in emotion followed by a rise, such as "You're so short, but still you're adorable," you create an [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | unpredictable]] emotional experience that generates excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

## Creating Psychological Intrigue

A crucial element in [[creating_mystery_and_anticipation_in_dating | creating mystery and anticipation]] is sparking a woman's intense interest and then pulling back, leaving her eager for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

### Unfinished Conversations
This technique involves intentionally stopping a conversation when excitement peaks, promising to finish it later.
*   **Example 1:** Saying you forgot something important and will tell her later due to an urgent phone call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.
*   **Example 2:** Remarking, "I've noticed something fascinating and strange about you. Do you know what it is?" and when she asks, replying, "Well, I'll tell you later, now's not the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.
*   **Example 3:** Starting a story, "Do you know there are two habits I hate in women? The first habit is that most women don't say what they mean and don't mean what they say," then going silent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. When she asks for the second, reply, "I don't think you're ready to hear it yet. I'll tell you when you're ready," and change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Making her wait increases her excitement, curiosity, and desire, leading her to think about you and creating a strong sense of [[the_role_of_uncertainty_in_attraction | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Strategic Departures
Leaving a date without revealing your feelings or promising another meeting maintains [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | absence and mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. It's best to end a date when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having fun, rather than letting it become dull <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. Not promising a future meeting makes her wonder if you enjoyed your time, and she'll try to figure out your level of interest, keeping you on her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

### Not Revealing Feelings Too Early
This is a critical aspect of maintaining [[the_role_of_uncertainty_in_attraction | uncertainty]] and [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | mystery]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. Movies often portray women loving honesty about feelings, but in real life, telling a woman you love her too early can instantly kill her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This is because the [[the_role_of_uncertainty_in_attraction | uncertainty]] about your true feelings is a primary factor in her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. It is advised to never tell a girl how you truly feel about her; instead, let her stay in a state of [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | mystery]] and keep playing the guessing game <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Maintaining Mystery in Everyday Interactions
Being mysterious does not mean fabricating your personality but simply not giving away too much information too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Over-sharing can signal low value and negatively affect her perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.

Instead of direct answers, use responses that create intrigue:
*   **Question:** "Where do you work?"
*   **Mysterious Response:** "Guess, and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. If she guesses correctly, it leads to another date; if not, it creates an aura of [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | mystery]], making her want to meet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
*   **Question:** "What are you doing Saturday night?"
*   **Mysterious Response:** "Something fun, but it's a secret, sorry I can't tell you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
*   **Question:** "Have you ever been in a relationship before?"
*   **Mysterious Response:** "I don't know you well enough yet; I don't share personal things with strangers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.

While the level of [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | mystery]] should gradually decrease over time, some degree of it should always be maintained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. For example, don't immediately disclose your whereabouts or give all details upfront about your activities, always keeping her wondering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## The Overall Impact of Unpredictability

To evoke a range of emotions and maintain attraction, it is crucial to be [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | unpredictable]] in everything you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Keep the woman guessing about your next move, and always maintain a slight sense of [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | mystery]] and [[the_impact_of_uncertainty_and_unpredictability_on_attraction | unpredictability]] in your conversations, behavior, and expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. A good mix of emotions, fueled by this [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | unpredictability]], forms the perfect recipe for long-term attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

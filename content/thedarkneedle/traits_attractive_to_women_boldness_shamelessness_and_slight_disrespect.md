This article explores "impudence" as a powerful communication style that can make a man attractive to women, focusing on its core components: cheekiness, boldness, shamelessness, and slight disrespect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This approach is rooted in instinctive attraction, rather than logic or modern principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Understanding Impudence

Impudence is defined as a lack of modesty or boldness combined with a slight disregard for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. While it might seem negative, in a woman's eyes, an impudent man is perceived as capable of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The ability to survive is the number one [[understanding_female_attraction | trait women look for in men]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

Historically, in survival scenarios, the "selfish, strong, and harsh" individual is more likely to survive, and women would compete to be with such a person because of their perceived higher chance of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Conversely, "nice guys" are often sought out only by women rejected by the "harsh man," or for opportunistic reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This genetic wiring to seek impudent men persists even in modern times where direct survival is not as critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Impudence and boldness are considered among the [[traits_women_find_attractive_in_men | traits that make a woman]] deeply love and get attached to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. When a woman perceives this type of boldness, she can become obsessively attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. This can be conveyed primarily through speech and how a man talks to a woman, especially early in an interaction, but requires moderation and intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Elements of Impudence in Conversation

Impudence in conversation is composed of four key elements:

### 1. Be Cheeky

Being cheeky means being a little mischievous in one's manner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. The goal is to make a woman wonder, "Did he really just say that or did he really just do that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This technique breaks the "boredom trance" that many women experience during typical, formal interactions with strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. By being different, a man can interrupt her pattern and capture her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

Cheekiness involves acting as if one doesn't know their place and showing too much familiarity too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Many men do the opposite, becoming overly careful and formal, which results in them being perceived as strangers, leading to indifference rather than attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

It is crucial to avoid neutrality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. If there is a disagreement, one should state it directly and maintain their position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. "Neutrality is weakness," and extreme opinions often correlate with influence and success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. One effective method to be cheeky is to offer unsolicited advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. For example, telling a blonde-haired woman, "You'd look really beautiful with black hair," shows excessive familiarity and grabs attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. This creates an emotional response because it's surprising and edgy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.

### 2. Be Bold

Boldness is described as the most attractive [[personality_traits_to_attract_women | trait to all humans]], both emotionally and non-emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>. Being bold means taking a risk, whether it's a real risk, a potential embarrassment, or something else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. The key is to live fully in the present, focusing energy on the action without considering future outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

In interactions with women, men must be bold and take the first step, whether initiating conversation, flirting, or making physical moves like holding hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Bold actions, even simple ones, significantly impact those around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. People are drawn to bold individuals because they do the unexpected, counteracting the boredom of repetition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. Shy people, who fear any risk, are generally less appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Examples of demonstrating boldness include:
*   Telling a girl who is talking too much or raising her voice to "Shut your trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This is a phrase typically reserved for close friends or partners, not strangers, and thus creates shock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Directly addressing a girl who is staring at you with a statement like, "I just totally caught you staring at me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. This is playful but also bold, pulling her out of her reality and prompting her to question the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

The sooner boldness is introduced into a conversation, the more effectively it can set a tone for an emotionally charged, attractive interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### 3. Be Shameless

Shamelessness involves having the courage to say things as they are and voicing what one is thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. It is saying what's not socially "supposed to be said," similar to how a five-year-old child might point out something obvious that others are thinking but too shy to vocalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

It's crucial to distinguish between attractive shamelessness and "dumb" shamelessness. The latter involves hurtful comments, like insulting someone's physical appearance, which is to be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Attractive shamelessness means saying what you're thinking as long as it doesn't hurt anyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Examples of smart shamelessness:
*   Reflecting on something she said earlier and sharing your true, unreserved feeling about it, e.g., "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   Asking personal, yet non-insulting questions that might seem unusual for a new acquaintance, such as "Does that mean you don't shave your legs?" when she mentions girls' night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This can escalate the conversation to a deeper, even sexual, level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   Pointing out the "elephant in the room" in a non-hurtful way, such as commenting on a height difference ("I didn't see you. I didn't notice at first that you're short") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This shows a lack of shame and willingness to address obvious observations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   "Connecting the dots" by filling in what she might have left out of a story, such as suggesting "the sex got boring or no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" when she describes a failed dating app encounter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

The key takeaway for shamelessness is to always point out the "elephant in the room" and say what everyone else is thinking but is too shy to vocalize, especially in mixed groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### 4. Be Slightly Disrespectful

To master [[impudence_and_its_role_in_attraction | impudence]], one must be slightly disrespectful, which does not mean being insulting or treating someone poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Instead, it means giving her the same level of respect one would give their best friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. Friends are typically not treated with excessive politeness; they might be joked with or even spoken to bluntly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Many men make the mistake of treating women with excessive respect, similar to how they might treat an authority figure, which prevents any emotional reaction and makes it impossible to spark attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Over-respecting a woman can lead her to believe she is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. The ideal approach is to treat her like a best friend, even upon first meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This is part of [[strategies_for_being_attractive_without_compromising_masculinity | being attractive without compromising masculinity]].

One way to be slightly disrespectful is by not responding directly to every question she asks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Many men feel compelled to answer every question directly and with a long, thoughtful reply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. Instead, one can completely ignore a question initially, perhaps by changing the subject, and then return to it later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. This shows she is not controlling the conversation and makes the interaction more unpredictable and interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>. This unpredictability creates surprise and triggers attraction by creating a sense of fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. It also makes her feel that she needs to "win you over," as you are not simply submitting because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

By applying these principles – being cheeky, bold, shameless, and slightly disrespectful – a man can convey strength, fearlessness, and avoid giving excessive attention, which can make a woman chase him and value him more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

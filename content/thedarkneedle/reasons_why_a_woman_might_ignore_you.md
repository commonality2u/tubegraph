From: [[thedarkneedle]] <br/> 

There are two primary reasons why a woman might ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>:

1.  **It's a test** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This type of ignoring occurs only when a woman is already interested in you, for instance, if you've already gone out with her or she previously showed signs of interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. This specific scenario will be discussed in a future video <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.
2.  **She perceives you as a guy with limited options** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This is the more common reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, especially if she wasn't interested from the start and shows no signs of caring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Perceiving You As Having Limited Options

This happens when a man gives a woman excessive attention, making her feel like she is his only desire and that he is willing to do anything to please her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This implies that the man believes he has low value and that his only goal is for her to notice him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The core reason she ignores you is that she senses you lack other options in your life and are chasing her because she's the only one you care about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### The Mistake of Lying About Options

A common [[mistakes_men_make_while_interacting_with_women | mistake]] men make is trying to lie or hint that they have many options to counteract this perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This approach often involves fabricating stories about other women or dating a bunch of girls just to appear busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

However, lying about options leads to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>:

*   **She will discover you are lying** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Lying is a significant [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction killer]] because it makes her feel like you are desperate for her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **She will perceive you as seeking her approval** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Even if she understands you're trying to convey options, the attempt itself signals a need for her validation, which is one of the biggest [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | mistakes]] you can make when [[understanding_female_attraction | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Simply hinting that you have many options also worsens the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### The Solution: The Qualifying Technique

Women are less concerned with whether you *actually* have many options and more with how you interact with them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. If you treat a woman in a way that suggests you have options, she will assume you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. The "qualifying technique" is an effective way to achieve this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

Qualifying means screening or filtering potential options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This action subconsciously communicates that you have numerous options, as only individuals with options would engage in such filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This technique is powerful and often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

Qualifying helps to solidify a woman's attraction by shifting the dynamic from casual flirting to genuine interest, making her think, "I really like this guy and I want to know more about him" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. The mantra to remember is "Be the Chooser, not the Chaser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

When you qualify a woman, she feels that you are choosing her over others, that she is winning you over and impressing you not just because of her looks, but because of her true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. She needs to know you like her for qualities beyond her physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Without qualification, she might assume you're merely trying to "get into her pants" or that you lack options and would accept any girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Qualifying communicates that you are discerning because you have options and have chosen her for a specific, meaningful reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Three Ways to Qualify a Woman

Here are three effective ways to qualify a woman and make her feel special and unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>:

#### 1. The Qualifying Question

Ask a question that encourages her to share positive qualities about herself, and then acknowledge those qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

**Examples**:
*   "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to, and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

When asked such a question, she will consider what qualities will make you like her more and will "sell herself" to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. When she shares, accept her answer by saying something like, "Wow, that's really cool, I like that about you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This makes her feel special, not just a random girl, and indicates your genuine interest in her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. It also opens up new conversational avenues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

It's crucial to accept her response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. If you don't, she might feel rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. When she sells herself and you accept it, she will feel like she won you over with her personality, not her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. This is especially important for attractive women who are accustomed to being valued solely for their appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. This approach distinguishes you as a man with standards who filters his options and has chosen her because she is unique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

#### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy

Make a statement acknowledging a specific positive quality you've noticed in her, then invite her to confirm it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. If she accepts your statement as true, she will feel good and begin acting more consistently with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

**Examples**:
*   "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   "You know what I like about you? You're so bold. Like, you don't filter yourself at all. You just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing; it makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>
*   To an attractive woman: "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a> This works because attractive women often wish their intelligence was recognized more than their beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Generally, people don't value compliments they hear often and prefer recognition for qualities they secretly wish others would notice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

The key is to make it a genuine, positive statement that she will feel good about affirming with a "yes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Once she agrees, she will start to act more consistently with that quality, becoming more open around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. She will feel that you recognize something valuable and unique about her, fostering a special connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This also encourages her to be that kind of person to be accepted, making her feel special and lucky to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Be prepared to also open up and be genuine with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

Other qualities to look for include: open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, and easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

#### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself

Often, women will spontaneously qualify themselves to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Your role is simply to notice and acknowledge her for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>.

**Examples of her qualifying herself**:
*   Bragging about herself or telling you things to gain your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touching you or showing direct interest to demonstrate she likes you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asking if you are single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you sense she is trying to impress you and gain your liking, acknowledge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is cool, say you like her, or put your arm around her to show acceptance and let her know she's winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. If you fail to acknowledge these actions, she may feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. However, when you acknowledge and accept her, she will feel great and continue to favor you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This principle applies beyond dating; acknowledging positive traits in anyone makes them feel seen and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

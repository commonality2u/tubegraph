To convince someone to adopt your perspective or to perform a desired action, there are two primary steps: understanding their inner thoughts and then influencing their thinking through carefully chosen words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach is also applicable when seeking to meet, attract, or win over women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. [[Techniques to Influence Thoughts and Actions | Techniques to influence thoughts and actions]] will be explained, focusing on how to understand someone's inner mind and the psychological impact of word choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Step 1: Getting Inside Their Mind by Building Connection

The most direct way to understand someone's inner mind is by establishing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Building a connection involves deliberately creating a match or rapport with another person, similar to an instant bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. It is easier to persuade someone with whom you have a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

### The Role of Non-Verbal Communication

Our brains constantly and unconsciously process a significant amount of non-verbal information from others, such as facial expressions, body language, and movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The human body communicates non-verbally through its three main parts: the head, body, and feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The principle of building a connection through non-verbal cues is based on the idea that your physical actions affect your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. By observing how others' bodies and faces move, you can discern their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Subsequently, by subtly copying their movements, you may begin to experience a similar mood, which occurs due to the link between your body and emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

*   **Practical Experiment**: To illustrate this, try walking with your head up, looking at the skyline and smiling for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Then, walk with your head down, looking at the ground, slowing your pace, putting your hands in your pockets, and dragging your feet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Notice how your mood shifts solely based on your posture, without conscious happy or sad thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

This experiment demonstrates that changing your posture directly influences your mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Therefore, by mirroring someone else's posture, you can begin to feel what they feel, which is a method of understanding their emotional state and getting into their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. To make a connection, it's necessary to adjust your own mood to match theirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Steps to Adjust Mood and Build Connection

1.  **Observe**: Observe another person's posture to understand their mood (e.g., bored, happy, sad, curious, enthusiastic, calm, nervous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.
2.  **Mirror**: Use your body to mirror their posture and define their mood (e.g., happy, sad, disoriented, or angry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
3.  **Immerse**: Fully immerse yourself in that mood by using inner dialogue to repeatedly think of the word defining the mood, ensuring your thoughts align <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. Recall past memories where you felt that way, remembering images, feelings, and sounds to truly experience it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.
4.  **Approach and Maintain**: Approach the person while maintaining the mood, speaking normally and consistently until both are on the same emotional wavelength, thereby making a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Once a connection is established, you will sense it as things are going well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. To change the other person's mood, gradually shift your own gestures, posture, and smile, and observe their mood changing alongside yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This process influences another person at a subconscious level through non-verbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

> **Note**: There is a significant difference between adapting and imitating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Adapt to aspects of others' movements subtly without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Do not overtly copy gestures, as this is imitation and can cause embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Step 2: Speaking to Their Awareness with the Right Words

After establishing a connection, you can enhance your chances of persuasion through your use of words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. It's not just about *what* you say, but *how* you say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Certain verbal [[manipulation_strategies_in_communication | techniques]] can psychologically affect the other person's subconscious, reducing their tendency to refuse and increasing their likelihood of agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Verbal Persuasion Techniques

Here are several [[effective_communication_strategies | techniques]] to influence thinking, to be used once a connection is made:

*   **Emphasize the Obvious**: To make someone believe something is obvious, simply state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   Examples: "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Questions That Aren't Really Questions**: To get someone's subconscious to agree, state what you want them to agree with and add a question at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Ensure the tone of voice decreases at the end of the question, rather than increasing as in a typical question, to avoid inviting a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   Examples: "You already know everything about that, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>, "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>, "Probably it's time for another drink, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, "My plane is about to take off; there's no problem if I skipped a line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

*   **"Let's" for Disguised Orders**: Use "let's" followed by what you want to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This is a disguised order, which is more effective than questions like "should we," as questions allow for easier refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
    *   Examples: "Let's walk a bit more" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, "Let's have another one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, "Let's go to my place" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

*   **Encourage "Yes" Mode**: The more you get others to say "yes," the more likely they are to continue agreeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. By eliciting several consecutive "yes" responses, you train their minds to comply, putting them in a "yes mode." Save your most important request for the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

*   **"This or That" Choices**: Offer two options, both of which are suitable for you, rather than asking if they want something at all <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
    *   Example: "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait, or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This works because it offers a choice between two preferred outcomes, not a choice to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

*   **Anticipate the Future**: Tell others how you expect them to react to something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I know you'll be thrilled about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, "I know you'll want to repeat the experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>, "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you, I know you'll be impressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.

*   **Logical Leaps ("Therefore" or "This Means That")**: Connect two concepts, where the first is true and the second is what you want others to agree with, using "therefore" or "this means that" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This creates a link that may or may not inherently exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   Examples: "You're watching this video (true); this means that you like it (maybe true)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>, "We've been together for 3 months; therefore, I must be serious about this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **"Order and Order"**: Deliver your desired command first, then immediately follow it with a second, easily followed command <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. The person will tend to hear only the second command but will often follow the first without questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   Examples: "It's late and you're tired, take out the garbage and come to bed early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>, "Come over to my place to have a drink and tell me everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

*   **"I Shouldn't Tell You This, But..."**: This phrase builds loyalty and trust, making others feel special and encouraging them to treat you as a confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **"But" for Emphasis**: What follows the word "but" receives the most attention and is what you want to emphasize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I know that I don't have much experience in this area, but I've proven in the past that I can adapt quickly to new environments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>, "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

*   **The "Ideal" Question**: Asking "What do you ideally want?" or "What would be the ideal result?" makes others truthfully express their desires, encouraging them to visualize perfect scenarios rather than just possible ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. This positive visualization can greatly influence their mood and provides valuable information for influencing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Example: In a job interview, asking "Ideally, what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" prompts the interviewer to describe their ideal image <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. You can then adapt your answers to match their description, giving the impression you are that candidate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **"Tell It Without Telling It"**: Express your point of view or create images in others' minds without overtly stating them, often by saying what you *won't* tell them or *don't* want them to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I can't tell you to leave him; the decision must be yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>, "I won't be the one to tell you that you're wrong" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>, "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **"Yes Means No" (Offering What You Don't Really Want to Do)**: Offer to do something you don't truly want to do, implying reluctance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I could give you a ride home if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, "I could do it if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

*   **"It's Not Important, But It Is"**: Use lines like "I know that you won't consider my advice, but..." or "Maybe you won't care, but..." when giving feedback that the other person might not like or want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

*   **"I Don't Know If You Realize..."**: This is a polite way to tell someone to listen and pay attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   Examples: "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, "I don't know if you realize how long I've been tolerating this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

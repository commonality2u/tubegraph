When interacting with women, there are specific actions men should take and others they should avoid to prevent sabotaging their chances at a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Even a charming individual can fail if they make certain [[common_mistakes_men_make_when_a_woman_loses_interest | mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## A Cautionary Tale: The Park Encounter

A young man repeatedly encountered an attractive woman in a park <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Initially, he hesitated to approach her, paralyzed by negative thoughts and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This pattern of internal conflict and inaction continued for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

When he finally managed to approach her, his nervousness led to fumbling words and awkward, short conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Despite her polite responses, he struggled to maintain her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. After persistent effort, he secured a few dates, but his increasing attachment and insecurity became apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He started visiting the park multiple times a day, consumed by thoughts of whether she liked him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Feeling confused, he confessed his feelings, to which she responded that she only saw him as a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. He continued to pursue her, but she consistently turned him down, valuing their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Over time, she distanced herself, spending less time in the park and becoming preoccupied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. When he called to ask why they weren't talking, she gave an excuse of being busy, and their connection never resumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This story, in fact, was the speaker's own past experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

The young man in the story demonstrated several traits of a "low value male" which ultimately sabotaged his chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Common Mistakes Men Make

### 1. Putting Her on a Pedestal

A significant mistake is putting a woman on a pedestal merely because of her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. High-value males do not give excessive importance to a woman solely based on her appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. It's crucial to convey that you value personality over looks, as personality is a rare trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This attitude can make you stand out as "that special different guy," which many women seek <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

### 2. Agreeing Too Much

Constantly agreeing with a woman to keep her comfortable is a poor strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This gives off a weak vibe, signaling that you are seeking her approval or permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Always playing by her rules implies that you fear losing her and don't consider yourself good enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Women generally desire a challenge, and constant agreement removes that element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

### 3. Desperately Seeking Approval and Acceptance

Seeking a woman's approval or acceptance is an [[common_misconceptions_about_attracting_women | attraction killer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. The moment she perceives you seeking her approval, she will be turned off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. A key way to avoid this is to [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | not talk too much]] and instead let her do most of the talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. By making the conversation about her and taking yourself out of the equation, you prevent yourself from trying to convince her you're "the best man" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### 4. Making Your Intentions Clear Too Early

Confessing your feelings or saying "I love you" too early in a relationship can kill attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. When a woman knows you are "into them," she may feel she has "conquered" you, leading to a loss of tension and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. To maintain attraction, it's advised to keep her guessing about your true feelings, creating an element of confusion and insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.

### 5. Trying to Solve Her Problems

Trying to solve a woman's problems is a quick way to end up in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. When you solve her issues, you get placed into the "provider zone," akin to a big brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This subconscious communication of low value prevents her from seeing you as a potential lover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Women typically don't discuss problems seeking solutions; they primarily want a good listener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

### 6. Acting Too Disinterested

While some pickup dynamics suggest showing disinterest, many men misunderstand this and act rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The correct approach is a mix of interest and disinterest, never complete disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Correct Example**: "You look cute in this dress but pink would have been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This shows interest ("cute") and a slight hint of disinterest ("pink would have been better") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
*   **Wrong Example**: "This dress isn't looking good on you, you should have tried pink" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. This is rude and shows disinterest twice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.

You should show interest but not chase her for attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

### 7. Discussing Your Problems or Insecurities

Sharing your issues or problems with women is an [[common_misconceptions_about_attracting_women | attraction killer]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. It implies you are not strong enough to deal with them yourself and need her help or sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Similarly, revealing insecurities, past failures, or struggles gives a dull impression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. The only exception is if you can mention weaknesses humorously, making fun of yourself in a way that shows you don't care about her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### 8. Always Giving a Direct "Yes"

Never be too easy for a woman; avoid falling into the "yes circle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Make her work a little to get a "yes" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. For instance, if she asks to go shopping, respond with a condition like, "No, first we will watch a movie and then shopping" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This should only be applied to random requests, not important or urgent ones, like taking her to a doctor if she's sick <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

### 9. Getting Mad or Upset

If you get mad or upset over a woman's actions, it signals a lack of control, indicating she controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[0:10:47]</a>. Even if she says nasty things, you should never react with anger or by losing your cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Often, a woman might be testing your reaction in extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>; reacting predictably means failing the test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

To successfully approach someone you're interested in, maintaining a calm and relaxed demeanor is crucial. [[Mindset and Confidence in Social Interactions | Nervousness]] can convey a lack of [[Mindset and Confidence in Social Interactions | confidence]], potentially leading to rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Overcoming initial anxiety, especially for those new to social interactions, begins with taking small, actionable steps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Starting Small: The "Ask for the Time" Exercise

A practical technique to build [[Mindset and Confidence in Social Interactions | confidence]] is to approach ten different people each day and simply ask for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To ensure this exercise is effective, avoid wearing a watch and turn off your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This simple act can significantly boost your [[Mindset and Confidence in Social Interactions | confidence]], leading to a greater sense of ease after just a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Performing this exercise a few minutes before planning more involved conversations can help you feel more comfortable approaching others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

### Choosing the Right Environment

For this exercise, opt for calm settings like parks, malls, or coffee shops, rather than nightclubs, where asking for the time might seem out of place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

For beginners, avoiding nightclubs for initial approaches is also advisable due to:
*   **High competition:** Many other individuals are attempting similar interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Defensive attitudes:** People may be on guard due to frequent approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Loud music:** Makes conversation difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Instead, consider places like hobby classes (yoga, salsa, aerobics), restaurants, coffee shops, public libraries, or malls, which offer more opportunities with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

## The Approach Itself

Once you've identified someone you'd like to talk to, make your approach within five seconds of deciding to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Delaying can lead to self-doubt and heightened nervousness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Key Principles for Successful Approaches

The primary goal when approaching someone is to make them comfortable in your presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Trying too hard can raise their defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Avoid common mistakes:
*   **Approaching from the front:** This allows them to see you coming and mentally prepare defenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Approaching from behind:** This can startle them and ruin your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

The best way to approach is from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. A non-threatening posture involves walking past them, tilting your head in their direction, and starting a conversation by talking over your shoulder, ensuring your chest faces away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Starting the Conversation

Direct approaches, such as immediately asking for a drink or using canned pickup lines, often lead to rejection as they imply only casual interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Instead, your opener should demonstrate that you're not directly trying to "hit on them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

Examples of effective openers:
*   **The "In a Hurry" Opener:** Pretend to be on the phone, walk by, pause, and ask a question relevant to a "conversation" you're having. For instance, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men, is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Crucially, state you're in a hurry and have to go, which lowers their defenses and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Situational Openers:** Be natural and adapt to the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   In a restaurant: Ask about what they're eating or drinking, pretending you're new to the place and need suggestions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   Commenting on attire/accessories: "That's a pretty interesting bracelet you have on, what's the story behind that?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>
*   **Guessing or Assuming:** Instead of asking direct questions like "What do you do?" or "Where are you from?", make a guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. For example, "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This often prompts a "Why do you say that?" response, opening the conversation naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## Transitioning and Deepening Connection

After the initial opener, the challenge is to move beyond casual talk and spark stronger [[creating_positive_emotional_connections_through_dialogue | emotional attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Apply techniques such as:
*   The [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | qualifying technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>
*   The [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions | listen like a therapist technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   [[building_connections_through_nonverbal_communication | Body language]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>
*   The [[creating_excitement_in_interactions | push and pull technique]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>
*   [[creating_excitement_in_interactions | Mystery]] (tell a bit and leave them wanting more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

### Engaging with Friends

If approaching a group, dedicate more attention to the target's friends than the target initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. This makes your interest less obvious and can make the target curious and work for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. For example, after being introduced, start talking more to one of her friends and momentarily avoid the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### Physical Touch

[[Building connections through nonverbal communication | Physical touch]] is crucial for attraction, as playful contact can double the impact of your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Once someone allows physical touch, their defenses lower, opening the door for further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

Simple routines for light physical touch:
*   **Hands/Nails:** Stare at their hands, gently grab fingers, and comment on their nails, perhaps suggesting a different color <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Forehead:** Notice something on their forehead, and lightly clean it with your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Hair:** Comment on their hair color or style and gently touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **High Five:** Offer a high five, saying something like, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

## Getting the Phone Number

If you've established good conversation and attraction, getting a phone number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Provide a motive for asking for the number to persuade them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

One method involves:
1.  Transitioning into an interesting story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
2.  Mid-story, mention, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," then continue the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
3.  When the story ends, they'll likely ask what you noticed. At this point, check your watch and say you're running late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
4.  Hand them your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.

This approach often works because they are curious to continue the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. Handing over your phone also ensures you get the correct number, which you can confirm with a quick call <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. If they give a wrong number, you can playfully call them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. If they refuse entirely, it means you haven't built enough attraction, and it's best to politely say goodbye and walk away without waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Immediately after getting the number, exit the venue to avoid awkwardness and prevent the attraction you built from reversing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

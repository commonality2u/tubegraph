Honesty is a powerful tool in dating, capable of fostering strong connections and attracting women. Lying, conversely, can diminish your perceived value and create an unfavorable dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Dishonesty
When one person lies, it often signifies that they perceive the other individual as holding a higher value, leading to a dynamic where the liar may care too much about the other's opinion, be afraid of them, or feel a need for their approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Lying to a woman should be avoided at all costs, as it creates an impression of lower value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

Attractive women, in particular, often assume that men will lie at some point due to their life experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. Women are generally more adept at detecting lies than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Therefore, when a man consistently demonstrates honesty, it can surprise a woman and lead her to question his motives, wondering why he isn't lying and where his [[the_importance_of_confidence_in_attraction | confidence]] comes from <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Demonstrating Honesty
True honesty is often revealed in situations of pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Telling an embarrassing or unflattering truth about yourself is a strong indicator of honesty, as it makes little sense to lie about something that puts you in a bad light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This act of vulnerability fosters trust and suggests that you are a genuinely honest person, even when it's uncomfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Examples of Uncomfortable Truths
*   **Admitting a loss:** If asked about a fight, truthfully stating that you lost or were beaten up, and even laughing about it, shows a high level of honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Stating true motivations:** A student, when asked why he works out, honestly replied, "to get girls." This unconventional and truthful answer, despite being potentially unflattering, made the girl listening feel that he was genuinely honest and didn't care about her opinion, leading to a long conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>.
*   **Giving honest opinions:** If a girl asks for an opinion on an outfit you don't like, honestly stating that it doesn't look good demonstrates integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

By being honest, especially in situations where it puts you under pressure, you project [[importance_of_confidence_and_selfworth_in_relationships | confidence]] and reinforce the idea that you are the "main character" in your own life, unconcerned with seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

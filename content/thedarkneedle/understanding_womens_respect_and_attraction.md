When studying [[psychology_of_womens_attraction | the psychology of women]] and how [[understanding_female_attraction | attraction]] works, a common phrase encountered is: "If a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This statement is true, but the respect a woman should have for a man is different from the respect shared between other people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Types of Respect

There are two distinct types of respect a woman might feel: <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>: This is the respect she might feel for a kind, elderly man, similar to her grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. It's the same kind of respect she has for her friends, including those who are in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Basic advice like "set boundaries" often only leads to this type of respect, keeping a man in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
2.  **Emperor-like Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>: This is the respect she might feel for a Roman Emperor â€“ powerful, inspiring, and impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Men who receive this type of respect are the ones she dreams and fantasizes about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This "Emperor-like respect" is the kind a woman should have for you to foster [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attraction]] and desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Respect gradually builds over time, rather than being built overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Attractive Respect: Power and Fear

The kind of respect that creates [[understanding_male_and_female_attraction | attraction]] is made up of two core components: **power** and **fear** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This is when she *wants* to respect you, not when you are trying to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. The "fear" component is subtle and enjoyable for her, not real fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### 1. Power

Having power in a relationship means your life remains the same after meeting a woman as it was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

*   **Resist Tests to Change You**: Women often test men by trying to make them change, especially in the early stages of getting to know them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This might involve suggesting changes to your style, haircut, habits (like smoking), friends, or job <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. If you succumb to these requests, you lose your power and, consequently, her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Maintain Your Opinions**: Do not change your opinions because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. While you shouldn't argue, simply state "no" calmly if she tries to dictate your choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Speak Through Actions**: For [[understanding_womens_psychology | women]], it's crucial to speak through your actions rather than prolonged justifications or debates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **No Sacrifices**: Do not sacrifice your happiness or interests for a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This common trope seen in movies doesn't work in reality and will likely land you in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. A woman should never be the reason for your change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Stop Unnecessary Apologizing**: Avoid apologizing without reason or for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Only apologize if you genuinely made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   **Situation 1: You did nothing wrong, but she's upset**: Do not apologize. Instead, tease and joke with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
    *   **Situation 2: You made a small mistake (in an established relationship)**: Apologize briefly, then give her space. Do not beg for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   **Situation 3: You made a big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: It's acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, including buying gifts or visiting her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **When She's at Fault**:
    *   **Situation 1: Minor mistake**: Do not show anger or drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   **Situation 2: Small mistake**: Hold her accountable without getting angry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. For example, if she cancels a date last minute, tell her she's "messing up her chances" and hang up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. If she apologizes, give her a serious task, like writing an apology letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. If she refuses, end contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   **Situation 3: Big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: Do not get angry, but end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Forgiveness in this scenario will lead to a permanent loss of respect and love, likely resulting in her exploiting you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

> [!tip] Never let her make you mad or upset. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a> If her actions control your reactions, she controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Remain calm like "The Rock in the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, as often she might be testing your reaction to extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Failing this test means losing your power and her respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### 2. Fear (Enjoyable Fear)

This aspect of fear is rooted in the principle: **Investment = Attraction = Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Most men mistakenly believe their investment in a woman (expensive dates, gifts) will win her over, leading them to the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Meanwhile, she might be with someone who puts in minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

*   **Her Investment Matters**: It's not *your* investment in her that matters, but *her* investment in *you* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The more you invest in her, the more attached you become, and the more she occupies your thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. However, if she isn't investing in you, her feelings remain unchanged, and her [[understanding_womens_attraction_to_men_with_options | attraction]] or desire won't increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Reverse the Situation**: The more she invests in you, the more attracted she will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. You still need to invest, but only enough to make her comfortable investing in you; then, let her take the lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Investment Leads to Fear of Loss**: As she starts to invest in you, her fear of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This is a fundamental human principle: the more we invest in something, the more we fear losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. For example, a piggy bank with $20 is less concerning than one with $3,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Similarly, the more a woman invests in you, the more she fears losing you, and this fear is the second key component of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

When power and enjoyable fear are present, no woman will dare to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

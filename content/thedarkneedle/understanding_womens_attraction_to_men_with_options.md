This article explores why a girl might ignore you and how to shift her perception to make her interested, focusing on the idea that women are attracted to men who appear to have options. It emphasizes a technique called "qualifying" to demonstrate value without resorting to dishonesty or seeking approval.

## Why She Might Be Ignoring You <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>

There are generally two reasons a girl might ignore you:
1.  **It's a test**: This occurs if she was previously interested or you've already gone out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.
2.  **She sees you as a guy with limited options**: This is the more common scenario, especially if she hasn't shown interest from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

If she perceives you as having limited options, it's likely because you've given her excessive attention, making her feel like she's your only desire and that you'd do anything to please her, stemming from a belief that you lack value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## The Problem with Lying About Options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

A significant mistake is attempting to make a girl believe you have many options by fabricating stories about other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This approach typically leads to negative outcomes:
*   **She'll discover you're lying**: This is an [[misconceptions_about_women_and_attraction | attraction killer]] because it suggests you're desperate for her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **She'll see you seeking her approval**: Even if she doesn't explicitly catch you in a lie, she'll understand you're trying to convey options to gain her approval, which is one of the biggest mistakes in [[the_mindset_of_attracting_women | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Don't make the mistake of lying or hinting that you have many options, as it only worsens the situation and makes her feel like you're willing to do anything to get her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## The Qualifying Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>

Instead of lying, the key is to interact with a woman in a way that suggests you have options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This is achieved through the "qualifying technique."

### What is Qualifying? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

Qualifying means screening or filtering. It's an action typically taken by someone who has many choices and needs to select among them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. By qualifying a girl, you subconsciously communicate that you have abundant options, as only men with options would engage in such a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Be the chooser, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

This technique is powerful because it solidifies a girl's [[understanding_the_concept_of_attraction_for_women | attraction]] for you, shifting her mindset from casual flirting to genuinely wanting to impress you and win you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. You want her to feel like you're choosing her over other girls, not just chasing a random one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This implies that you like her for qualities beyond her physical appearance, which is crucial for [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | women's respect and attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

If you don't qualify a girl, she might assume you're merely trying to "get into her pants" or that you lack options and would accept any girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Conversely, when you qualify her, she perceives you as discerning, with options, and that you've chosen her for a specific, unique reason <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

### Three Ways to Qualify a Girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>

Here are effective methods to qualify a girl and make her feel special:

#### 1. The Qualifying Question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>

Ask her a question that prompts her to reveal positive qualities about herself, then acknowledge those qualities.

**Examples:**
*   "You know, I've met so many people tonight, but for some reason, I'm drawn to you. I just feel really comfortable talking to you, and I don't know why that is. I'm so curious, what would you say is your most positive quality? I mean, if you had to say one thing, what would it be?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   "You know, I wasn't sure what you'd be like before I came over here, but you're actually really fun and easy to talk to, and I'm kind of curious about you now. What's something really interesting about you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>

When you ask such questions, she'll likely try to "sell herself" to you, hoping you'll like and accept her for those reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. When you accept her by saying something like, "Wow, that's really cool, I like that about you," she'll feel special and understood, not just a random girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This also helps you learn more about her and open new conversational paths <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT] Always accept whatever she tells you. If you don't, she might feel rejected and withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. By accepting her, she'll feel she won you over with her personality, distinguishing you from other men who only value her looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.

#### 2. The Self-Fulfilling Prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>

Make a statement acknowledging a positive quality you've observed in her, then ask if it's true. When she agrees, she'll feel good and begin acting more consistently with that quality around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

**Examples:**
*   "You know, there are a lot of really cute, interesting girls here at the bar, but I'm just really having a great time talking to you. I'm not sure if anyone has ever told you this before, but for me, it feels like you're really open, and that's so refreshing. A lot of people are really closed off when they first meet someone, so I appreciate that. Would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>
*   "You know what I like about you? You're so bold. Like, you don't filter yourself at all. You just say what's on your mind and don't try to censor it, and I really like that. It's refreshing. It makes me feel comfortable around you. But I mean, that's just my impression, I could be wrong, would you say that's true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>

The goal is to end with a question that encourages her to say "yes," affirming the quality you've identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This makes her feel recognized and creates a special connection, as if you understand something valuable about her that others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. The statement should be genuine, positive, and vague enough that she can't definitively deny it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

> [!TIP] Once you've set this positive "frame," she'll feel compelled to embody that quality to be accepted, leading her to become that person around you and feel special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Be prepared to open up and be genuine in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

**Other great qualities to look for:** open, fun, intelligent, adventurous, spontaneous, confident, sexually confident, easy to talk to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

For extremely attractive women, a powerful statement is, "I bet a lot of people don't realize how smart you are" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>. This resonates because attractive women often wish to be recognized for their intelligence rather than just their beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Generally, people value recognition for qualities they secretly wish others would acknowledge more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

#### 3. Notice and Acknowledge When She Qualifies Herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>

Often, girls will try to qualify themselves to you without prompting. Your role is simply to notice and acknowledge their efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

**Signs she's qualifying herself:**
*   Bragging or sharing things about herself hoping for your acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   Chasing you with positive body language (facing you, getting close) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.
*   Touching you or showing direct interest, wanting you to like her back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   Asking if you're single <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   Showing off for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.

When you sense she's trying to impress you or gain your liking, acknowledge her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Tell her what she's doing is cool, tell her you like her, or physically accept her (e.g., put your arm around her) to let her know she's winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

If you don't acknowledge her, she might feel rejected and become cold or indifferent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. But when you do, she'll feel great and continue trying to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

> [!NOTE] This principle applies beyond [[understanding_female_attraction | understanding female attraction]]; acknowledging positive qualities in anyone can make them feel seen and appreciated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

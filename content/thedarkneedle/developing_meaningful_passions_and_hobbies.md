The most attractive quality a man can possess, particularly to women, is to be a young man who embodies the traits of an older guy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. One of these key traits is having a deep, specific passion or hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.

## The Attraction of Passion

Many women are naturally attracted to the idea of being with an older man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. This attraction is not logical, nor is it solely based on factors like money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. It stems from the deeper emotional and psychological qualities that older men often possess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. When a young man exhibits these "old guy" traits, it can make any woman obsess over him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Possessing this type of passion can multiply a man's attractiveness tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

## Defining Meaningful Passion

There is a significant difference between a young man's passion and an older man's passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. A truly meaningful passion is one that is enjoyed purely for its own sake, without concern for external outcomes like fame or money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Production vs. Consumption
True passion is derived from **creativity and production**, rather than mere consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

*   **Consumption-based activities** are generally not attractive because they offer only passive enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Playing video games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>
    *   Watching movies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>
    *   Eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>
    *   Scrolling social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>
    *   Watching football (soccer) or anime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>

*   **Production and creativity-based activities** require effort and hard work but yield deep enjoyment and are highly attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>. Examples include:
    *   Programming and creating games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>
    *   Gardening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>
    *   Cooking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>
    *   Building a strong physique at the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:49:00">[04:49:00]</a>
    *   Hiking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>
    *   Martial arts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>
    *   Painting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
    *   Pottery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>
    *   Metalworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:53:00">[04:53:00]</a>

This type of passion is a "difficult hobby" that requires effort to yield enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>.

## Developing This Passion

As a man matures and engages in self-discovery, he may reach a point where he finds a true passion that becomes more significant than anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>. While easy, consumption-based activities like social media scrolling might seem fun, engaging in hobbies that require effort can unlock a deeper sense of enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00">[04:42:00]</a>.

## Showcasing Your Passion

Simply stating "I love hiking" will not evoke attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>. To make your passion a key to attraction, two methods are essential:

### 1. Prioritize Your Hobby
Make your hobby a non-negotiable part of your life, even if it means prioritizing it over a romantic partner at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.
*   For example, decline a date if it conflicts with a pre-planned hiking trip with friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.
*   If you have a martial arts training session at 7:00 p.m., do not meet her at that time or leave a date to attend it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:00">[05:17:00]</a>.
*   If she texts to meet, tell her you will meet after your workout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   Even if she attempts to persuade you to stay, or if you feel like skipping your workout, you must force yourself to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. This demonstrates your commitment to your passion and your ability to [[leading_yourself_in_life | lead yourself in life]].

### 2. Talk About Your Passion with Emotion
When discussing your passion, express the deep emotions it evokes within you, rather than just stating facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   Describe how it makes you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.
*   Share the feeling of lifting heavier weights at the gym, or the love for the pain in your muscles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.
*   Convey the satisfaction of reaching a mountain peak after an exhausting hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.
*   [[using_passion_and_enthusiasm_to_enhance_conversations | Talk about it with passion and strong emotional expression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.

By combining prioritization and emotional expression, you effectively display this highly attractive trait, which is a hallmark of the "old guy" persona <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>.

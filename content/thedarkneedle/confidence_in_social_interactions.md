True [[confidence_in_decisionmaking | confidence]] in social interactions, particularly when [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | approaching women]], stems from authenticity and a lack of overthinking, rather than trying to appear "cool" or say the "perfect thing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## The Power of Authenticity

A key lesson in effective social interaction is to stop acting with fake [[confidence_in_decisionmaking | confidence]] and instead "drop your shield" to let others see you as you are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This approach of simply saying what's on your mind is considered the only way to genuinely [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | approach women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Anything else is a crutch or a shield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

When you abandon the pressure to seem cool or say the perfect thing, a significant weight is lifted, allowing natural thoughts to flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This authentic behavior can lead to positive outcomes, such as mutual flirting and successful interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Laughter and Social Connection

Laughter is one of the most important aspects of human connection and a top factor in [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | attraction]] between men and women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. A strong, [[confidence_in_decisionmaking | confident]] laugh can instinctively attract women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Historically, loud and powerful laughter was associated with tribal leaders and strong men, while quiet laughter was a trait of weaker individuals who wished to avoid attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. While modern society often views loud laughter as impolite, leading most people to laugh softly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>, the way one laughs is a developed trait, like body language or an accent, and can be consciously changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Cultivating a powerful laugh can significantly improve one's [[impact_of_social_skills_on_relationships | social life]] and interactions with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Beyond Seriousness

Some believe that being serious most of the time enhances presence and strength, leading to respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. However, excessive seriousness and a lack of laughter can be detrimental to one's [[impact_of_social_skills_on_relationships | social life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. People often prefer not to be around those who are always serious, as they may lack friends or connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Spontaneity and Naturalness

When interacting with women, it's crucial to be spontaneous, avoid overthinking, and simply be natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Not taking things too seriously is the most important quality for attracting women and living happily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Any time you successfully captured a girl's attention, it was likely due to acting naturally and not trying to look cool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Women are drawn to men who are at ease with themselves, enjoy the moment, and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

## The "Authentic Approach" to Attraction

Many struggle with what to say when [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | approaching women]], often relying on pickup lines because they feel nervous and inadequate, trying to hide these feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, this approach doesn't solve the underlying problem and prevents comfortable communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

The "authentic approach" involves directly stating intentions without hiding attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. An effective opener is to simply walk up and say, "Hey, you're cute, I wanted to get to know you," introducing yourself and stating why you came over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This directness, known as "Shameless interest," clears up ambiguity and requires [[confidence_in_decisionmaking | courage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Shameless Interest vs. Compliments

While showing interest is important, you should not appear to be "entirely sold" on her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. When a girl is even slightly attractive, she typically assumes you're interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. Hiding your attraction can make you seem weak or lead to the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The key distinction is between showing you're attracted and showing you *desire her completely* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

*   **Shameless Interest:** A statement like "I like your hair" is casual and shows interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It's direct, honest, and allows you to express both what you like and what you don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. A lover says, "I'm interested in you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **Compliment:** Saying "Your hair is beautiful" is a compliment that she hears often, and it can put you in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. It also makes you seem weak, as you weren't able to express interest honestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. A friend says, "You're beautiful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## The Role of Non-Verbal Communication

The actual words you say when [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | approaching women]] have little value on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. [[the_role_of_confidence_in_attraction | Attraction]] is 80% to 90% non-verbal, relying on "subcommunication" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. This includes:
*   Tone of voice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>
*   Body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Eye contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>
*   Breathing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>

Subcommunication speaks directly to the subconscious, from which emotional and sexual desire arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. When you say, "I like you and I want to talk to you," it communicates that you are [[confidence_in_decisionmaking | confident]] and not overly concerned with her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

## Assuming Attraction

Women are naturally attracted to men they believe other women want, or men who have multiple options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.
*   **Men with options** assume women are attracted to them because they are used to interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. If a woman isn't attracted, it doesn't bother them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. They simply assume attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>.
*   **Men without many options** assume women are *not* attracted to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. They cling to any hint of interest, feeling they won't find anyone else and trying too hard to compensate for feelings of inadequacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

The harder a man tries to make a girl like him, the less she actually does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This "trying too hard" subtly communicates a lack of options, which women find unattractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

## Avoiding Over-Effort

When [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | approaching women]], if you feel good and have something genuinely attractive to say, say it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. If you're nervous or uncertain, don't overthink it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Simply introduce yourself and state your reason for approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Your mission is to discover if she is interesting and worth your time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Anything beyond this is "over effort," which works against you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. What you say initially is less important than how you show up and how you make her feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

The regret of missing an opportunity due to overthinking can be a powerful lesson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. The key is to take action and not hesitate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

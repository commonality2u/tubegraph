When interacting with women, focusing on certain body language techniques can significantly impact attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The goal is to project a mindset where you perceive yourself as being in a higher position, and she in a lower one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, without overthinking the conversation itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Foundational Mindset

Before diving into specific body language cues, it's crucial to adopt a particular internal mindset:
*   **See her as a human being** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. Do not place an attractive woman on a pedestal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. Internalize that "she's just a human being" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
*   **Perceive yourself as superior** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This means treating her in a way that shows you see yourself as better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
*   **Understand attraction is subconscious** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Women are emotional beings drawn to feelings, and their attraction is a subconscious response to specific male behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. They do not consciously control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **The "Radar" concept** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. When you talk to a woman, her subconscious mind's "radar" activates, scanning to determine your suitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This radar operates independently of her conscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It looks for indications that you appear to be better than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Key Body Language Points

Traditional body language advice (e.g., "head up," "no hands in pockets," "straight back") is considered ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Instead, focus on these three critical points:

1.  **Lean Away While Talking** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>: Many men mistakenly lean towards a woman, which can signal excessive interest and be a turn-off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Consciously leaning away demonstrates disinterest or a higher value, which can increase attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>.
2.  **Be Willing to Walk Away** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>: If she expresses disapproval or disinterest, consider almost walking away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This is unexpected by attractive women, who are used to being pursued, and demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. For example, if she says "I'm not really interested," you could respond with, "I know, I'm probably too much for you to handle, you're too much of a nice girl anyway," and begin to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. She will likely try to stop you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
3.  **Sit Comfortably and at Ease** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>: The person with higher value in a conversation is the one who sits comfortably and appears unconcerned with the other person's presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
    *   Do not overthink how you should sit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
    *   Feel free to put your hands in your pockets, stretch your legs, or lean back if it makes you comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
    *   The woman will notice your comfort, not the specific actions of your limbs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
    *   Apply this mindset broadly in life: prioritize your comfort and do not try to impress others with contrived body language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

By adopting these body language cues and the underlying mindset, women will subconsciously perceive you as being "better" than them, which triggers attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Conversation Communication Formula

Beyond body language, a specific formula for conversation flow can reinforce this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>:
*   **50% of the conversation:** Focus on her and her personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. The person who talks excessively about themselves typically seeks approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. For this part, employ the "[[techniques_for_effective_communication | listen like a therapist]]" technique, discussing what she likes/dislikes, her childhood, dreams, and self-perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **30% of the conversation:** Discuss the surrounding environment or random topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Don't censor yourself or try to be profound; say whatever comes to mind, even if it's silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Avoid getting angry or debating to prove a point; remember you don't need her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   **20% of the conversation:** Talk about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
    *   **Self-deprecating humor:** Never try to impress her by detailing your achievements or adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Instead, make fun of yourself or tell stories that make you look silly or crazy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This demonstrates you don't need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   **Be mysterious:** Avoid revealing too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Giving detailed answers to questions signals low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Instead, use playful evasions to maintain intrigue, making her want to know more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

This approach ensures you don't appear to be seeking her approval, reinforcing your perceived higher value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

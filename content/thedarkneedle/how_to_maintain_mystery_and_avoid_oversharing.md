Maintaining an element of mystery and avoiding oversharing are crucial techniques for [[creating_mystery_and_anticipation_in_dating | attracting women]] and keeping them engaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. When interacting with a woman, her subconscious mind acts as a "radar" that scans you to determine if you are suitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This radar, disconnected from her logical mind, seeks a man who appears to be "better" than her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. A key way to signal this higher value is by showing you don't need her approval, which is directly tied to how much information you reveal about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## The Role of Mystery in Attraction

Women are emotional beings who are drawn to what they feel, and their attraction is a subconscious response to certain behaviors exhibited by men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. They do not consciously control who they are attracted to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Introducing an element of mystery into your personality is part of this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### What Being Mysterious Means
Being mysterious does not mean faking your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Instead, it means you should not reveal too much about yourself too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Giving detailed answers to every question a girl asks can unintentionally signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Strategies for Avoiding Oversharing

To maintain intrigue and ensure she desires to know more, limit the amount of personal information you disclose upfront <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### Conversation Ratios
When talking to a woman, a good conversational breakdown is:
*   **50% about her and her personality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   **30% about the environment or other general topics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **20% about yourself** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

The person who talks excessively about themselves is often perceived as needing the other's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Therefore, talk about her more than you talk about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### How to Talk About Yourself (The 20%)
When it is your turn to talk about yourself, follow these guidelines:
*   **Avoid self-aggrandizement:** Never try to impress her by detailing your achievements or adventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Embrace self-deprecating humor:** Instead, make a little fun of yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Tell stories that make you look silly or crazy, rather than great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. This demonstrates that you do not need her approval or admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

### Examples of Maintaining Mystery
When asked direct questions, provide playful or evasive answers to create intrigue. This [[creating_psychological_intrigue_in_relationships | psychological intrigue]] ensures there is always more she wants to know, keeping her hooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Consider these examples for [[importance_of_mystery_and_unpredictability_in_dating | the role of mystery and unpredictability in attraction]]:

*   **Her:** "Where do you work?"
    *   **You:** "Hold on there, speedy kitten, we've just met and you're already interviewing me?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>
*   **Her:** "What are you doing Saturday night?"
    *   **You:** "Something exciting but secret, sorry, can't tell you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>
*   **Her:** "Have you ever been in a relationship?"
    *   **You:** "I don't know you that well yet. I don't discuss private stuff with strangers." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>
*   **Her:** "So, what's your name?"
    *   **You:** "Take a guess, I'll give you a candy if you get it right." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>

By applying these strategies, you project an image of a high-value individual who is comfortable in their own skin and not seeking validation, fostering the [[role_of_absence_and_mystery_in_building_attraction | attraction]] that women subconsciously seek.

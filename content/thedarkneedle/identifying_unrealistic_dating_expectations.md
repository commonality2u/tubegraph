When seeking a partner, many individuals grapple with the dilemma of finding someone who possesses all their desired qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This challenge is often compounded by societal influence, especially with the prevalence of terms like "red flags" and "green flags" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Trying to find a partner by creating lists of desired "green flags" and undesirable [[understanding_red_flags_in_relationships | red flags]] and then searching for someone who perfectly matches them is described as an ineffective and ultimately fruitless strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This approach is considered unrealistic because it is "impossible to find a girl who has everything you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Those who suggest such rigid lists either do not understand how dating works or live by different rules <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Misconceptions About Red Flags

Some traditional "red flags" are deemed "nonsense" and examples of unrealistic expectations in dating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. A common example cited is the idea that a woman "shouldn't have male friends" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. This expectation is challenged because if a woman doesn't interact with men, it becomes illogical to expect her to interact with you to begin a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## A Different Approach to Partner Traits

Instead of searching for a perfect match or immediately abandoning a potential partner due to a minor dislike, a different strategy is proposed for [[establishing_boundaries_and_control_in_dating_dynamics | dealing with women]] and their traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. If you are attracted to a girl's appearance and she doesn't exhibit truly harmful traits (discussed below), the suggested approach is to date her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

For traits that you dislike but are not inherently destructive—such as a woman talking too much with men or wearing clothes you don't approve of—the solution is not to leave her, but to influence her to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. The belief is that a woman in a relationship should gradually change her personality, thoughts, and behavior to align with her partner's desires, especially as she falls in love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

This influence should be achieved by:
*   **Being the leader:** In any relationship, there is a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22">[02:22]</a>. The man should be the leader, controlling the relationship and influencing the woman to adopt his principles and preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44">[02:44]</a>.
*   **Expressing preferences without force:** Tell her what you want, but do not force it, control her, or manipulate her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07">[03:07]</a>. The goal is for her to *want* to please you of her own will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57">[02:57]</a>. This means:
    *   **Wait until she asks:** Do not state your preferences immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50">[03:50]</a>. Wait for her to inquire about your tastes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59">[03:59]</a>.
    *   **Do not justify or debate:** When you state your opinion, do not explain or try to convince her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20">[04:20]</a>. Simply state it as your preference and step back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29">[04:29]</a>.
    *   **Do not change your opinion:** Resist pressure to change your stance, as this undermines your leadership position and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34">[04:34]</a>.
*   **Do not show need or attachment:** Act indifferently about whether she changes or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10">[05:10]</a>. If she doesn't change, do not mention it or give it attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40">[05:40]</a>. This conveys that you do not *need* her to change, which paradoxically, often leads her to change herself over time as her attachment to you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53">[05:53]</a>.

## Truly Problematic Traits ("Red Flags" to Run Away From)

While many traditional "red flags" are dismissible, there are specific traits that are genuine indicators of an unhealthy relationship and should be avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45">[06:45]</a>. These are qualities a girl cannot change and will lead to suffering for the man involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47">[06:47]</a>. It is crucial to [[recognizing_emotionally_unhealthy_partners | recognize emotionally unhealthy partners]].

### 1. Flirting with Other Men

If a girl flirts with other men in your presence, she is likely seeking attention or trying to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53">[06:53]</a>. This type of behavior often indicates a "drama queen" personality that will not cease, leading to constant struggle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10">[07:10]</a>. It is important never to show jealousy, as that validates her behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19">[07:19]</a>.

### 2. Still Attached to Her Ex

If a girl openly states she still thinks about her ex, hasn't moved on, or wants him back, she is carrying heavy emotional baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29">[07:29]</a>. A high-value man should not get jealous, but instead, suggest she pursue her ex, demonstrating a willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41">[07:41]</a>. Such relationships are characterized by the ex being brought up frequently, negatively impacting the current relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06">[08:06]</a>. This is a common sign of a woman trying to put you in the [[dangers_of_overcommitting_emotionally_early_in_a_relationship | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02">[11:02]</a>.

### 3. "Energy Sucking" Women

This is considered the most dangerous [[understanding_red_flags_in_relationships | red flag]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20">[08:20]</a>. These women are characterized by:
*   **Insecurity:** They are deeply insecure, constantly seeking validation but never feeling satisfied, no matter how much attention they receive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40">[08:40]</a>. They have "endless emotional hunger" that cannot be fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54">[08:54]</a>.
*   **Using sex for validation:** They may use sex as a tool to satisfy emotional needs, even if they are in relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00">[09:00]</a>. This often stems from low self-esteem, offering "easy sex" for admiration to boost their self-esteem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16">[09:16]</a>.
*   **Drama and manipulation:** They frequently create chaos and may resort to manipulation due to feeling unworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26">[09:26]</a>.

It is crucial to understand a woman's personality deeply before committing to a relationship to avoid these types of partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41">[09:41]</a>.

## When a Woman Talks About Other Men

A common question is why women talk about other men in front of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58">[09:58]</a>. There are two main reasons:

1.  **To signal desire:** If she recounts stories of other men approaching her or expressing interest, she is likely trying to convey that she is desired and liked, aiming to impress you and implicitly encourage you to ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09">[10:09]</a>. This is not necessarily a bad sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32">[10:32]</a>.
2.  **To friend-zone you:** If she talks about an ex, her feelings for him, or her desire to get him back, she is trying to offload her emotions onto you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49">[10:49]</a>. This is a classic sign of being put in the [[dangers_of_overcommitting_emotionally_early_in_a_relationship | friend zone]] and indicates she has significant emotional baggage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02">[11:02]</a>. In this scenario, it is advised to walk away and let her deal with her issues independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13">[11:13]</a>.

When studying the psychology of women and attraction, a key phrase often encountered is: "If a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] a woman should have for you in a romantic context differs from the general [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] shown to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Standard advice like setting boundaries, showing [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] for the girl, or going to the gym, while good, does not foster the specific type of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] that leads to love <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] that makes a woman love you is a distinct kind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Two Types of Respect

There are two primary categories of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] a woman might feel:

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>:
    *   This is the [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] one might feel for a kind elderly man, like a grandfather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.
    *   It's also the [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] she has for her friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.
    *   Unfortunately, this type of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] often leads to being "stuck in the friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Basic pickup artist advice about setting boundaries often only cultivates this kind of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

2.  **Emperor-like Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>:
    *   This is the [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] one might feel for a Roman Emperor â€“ someone powerful, inspiring, and impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
    *   Men who command this type of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] are often the ones women fantasize about and [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | desire]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
    *   This is the essential type of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] a woman should have for you in a romantic context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.
    *   This [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] builds gradually over time, rather than overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>.
    *   It is not about *earning* her [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]], but about fostering a situation where she *wants* to [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   Emperor-like [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] is composed of two core elements: **power** and **fear** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The "fear" is subtle and enjoyable for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Components of Emperor-Like Respect

### 1. Power

[[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | Power]] in a relationship means your life remains the same after meeting her as it was before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Maintain Your Identity**: Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Any changes you make should be for yourself, not because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Women often test men by trying to make them change, especially early in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Giving in to these attempts (e.g., changing style, haircut, quitting habits, changing friends or job) leads to losing your [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | power]] and her [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Maintain Your Opinions**: Do not change your opinion because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. While you shouldn't argue, if she asks you not to wear something, simply say "no" calmly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Speak Through Actions**: With women, communicate through your actions rather than prolonged talking, justifying, or debating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   **Avoid Sacrifice**: Do not sacrifice your happiness or enjoyment for a girl, as this will put you in the [[understanding_the_difference_between_boyfriend_and_friend_categories | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. She should never be the reason for your personal change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Stop Unnecessary Apologies**: Do not apologize without reason or for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Before apologizing, ask yourself if you genuinely made a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

    *   **When *You* Are At Fault**:
        *   **Situation 1: You did nothing wrong, but she's upset**: Do not apologize. Instead, tease her playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
        *   **Situation 2: You made a small mistake (e.g., forgetting a minor gift in an established relationship)**: Apologize briefly ("sorry"), then give her space. Do not beg for forgiveness; let her come back naturally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
        *   **Situation 3: You made a big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: It's acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, buy a gift, or visit her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

    *   **When *She* Is At Fault**:
        *   **Situation 1: She says something upsetting**: Do not show anger or drama. Do not show that you care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
        *   **Situation 2: She makes a small mistake (e.g., last-minute date cancellation)**: Do not get angry, but hold her accountable. For example, tell her she's "messing up her chances" and hang up. If she calls back to apologize, give her a consequence like writing an apology letter. If she refuses, end contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.
        *   **Situation 3: She makes a big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: Do not get angry, but end the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Forgiving her in such a situation will cause her to permanently lose [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] for you, potentially leading her to exploit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

*   **Maintain Emotional Control**: Never let a girl make you mad or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Your reaction indicates her control over you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Remain calm like "The Rock in the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, as she may be testing your reaction to extreme situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Failing this test means losing [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | power]] and [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

### 2. Fear (The Enjoyable Kind)

This element of "fear" ties into the principle that **investment equals attraction, which equals respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

*   **Her Investment Matters**: Most men mistakenly believe their investment (e.g., expensive dates, gifts) will win a girl over, leading them to the [[understanding_the_difference_between_boyfriend_and_friend_categories | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. It's **her investment in you** that truly counts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.
*   **The Cycle of Investment**: The more time, effort, and money *she* spends on you, the more attracted she becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. If her investment doesn't increase, neither will her [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] or [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | desire]] for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Reverse the Situation**: You should invest just enough to make her comfortable investing in you, then allow her to take the lead in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Investment Leads to Fear of Loss**: As she invests in you, her "fear" of losing you grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This is a fundamental human principle: the more we invest in something, the more we fear losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Fear as a Component of Respect**: The more she invests, the more she fears losing you, and this fear is the second key component of [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | respect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

When [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | power]] and this enjoyable "fear" come together, no girl will dare to [[power_dynamics_and_respect_in_romantic_relationships | disrespect]] you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

This article provides techniques to approach women and obtain their contact information successfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. It guarantees a "yes" response every time if the techniques are applied correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Mindset and Preparation

Staying calm in all situations is important when learning [[authentic_approach_to_attracting_women | how to attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Being relaxed before an approach usually leads to success, while nervousness can result in a lack of confidence and potential rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. For those new to social settings, developing the right mindset can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

### Overcoming Approach Anxiety
The best way to overcome the fear of approaching is to take action, starting small <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>. Instead of jumping into full conversations, practice by approaching ten women daily and simply asking for the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. To ensure this exercise works, do not wear a watch and turn off your cell phone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. This simple exercise can significantly boost confidence, making you feel more at ease after just a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Choosing the Right Places

Selecting an appropriate location is crucial for successful approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Challenges of Nightclubs
Nightclubs are generally not the best environment for beginners to approach women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Going to a nightclub without much experience can lead to disappointment and discouragement due to several factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>:
*   **High Competition**: Many other men are also trying to meet women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Defensive Attitudes**: Women may be on guard because they are frequently approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   **Loud Music**: It's difficult to hold a clear conversation over the noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Recommended Settings for Beginners
Opt for calmer spots where conversations are easier and competition is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>:
*   Parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Malls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   Coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>
*   Hobby classes (yoga, salsa dancing, aerobics) often have more women and fewer men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>
*   Restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>
*   Public libraries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>

It is also beneficial to perform the "ask for the time" exercise a few minutes before planning to engage in longer conversations, as it boosts confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## The Approach Itself

Once you have chosen a location and identified a target, the way you approach is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

### The 5-Second Rule
Make your approach within 5 seconds of deciding to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Hesitation allows your brain to create excuses, leading to self-talk, insecurities, and increased nervousness, potentially preventing the approach altogether <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

### Common Mistakes to Avoid
Many guys get turned down because they don't know the right way to approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Approaching from the Front**: If she sees you "charging" towards her, she will put up her "Wall of Resistance" before you even speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.
*   **Approaching from Behind**: Touching her shoulder or starting a conversation without notice can scare her and instantly make her avoid you, ruining your chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

Women who are frequently approached automatically assume that a direct approach is only for casual sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. [[authentic_approach_to_attracting_women | Witty pickup lines]] also tend to result in more rejections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The key to success is to make her comfortable in your presence before proceeding further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

### The Best Way to Approach: From the Side
Always approach from the side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This method does not scare her and prevents her from seeing you coming directly, thus avoiding the "wall of defense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A good technique is to walk past her, tilt your head in her direction, and start the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Ensure your chest faces the other direction, talking over your shoulder; this is a non-threatening posture that makes her comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | Opening Conversations]]

Direct approaches typically do not work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. To start a conversation, you must act in a manner that shows you are not trying to "hit on" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Indirect Openers
*   **The "Cell Phone" Opener**: Pretend to be on your cell phone. As you pass by a woman you want to approach, look over your shoulder, pause, and holding the phone to your ear, say, "Oh, here's someone, let me ask her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Then ask her, "My friend here on the phone says girls lie more than men, is that true?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
    *   After her response, hang up and say you are in a hurry but your friend advised never to trust a female <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. This tactic lowers her defenses because she knows you won't linger, and it demonstrates high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
*   **Natural Openers**: The best way to open conversations is to be as natural as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Contextual**: If you are at a restaurant, ask about what she is eating or drinking, pretending you need a recommendation because you're new to the place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   **Observation-Based**: In a neutral environment, comment on what she is wearing, such as an interesting bracelet, and ask about its story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
*   **Guessing/Assumption**: Instead of asking direct questions like "What do you do?" or "Where are you from?", guess instead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. For example, "Are you from California?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This often prompts a "Why do you say that?" response, which helps open the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

It is important to observe what the woman is doing at the point of approach and work according to the environment, rather than relying solely on memorized "canned openers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

## Transitioning and Building Attraction

After successfully opening a conversation, the next challenge is to transition it to the next level and spark strong emotional attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. Without this, the conversation remains casual talk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Apply techniques such as the [[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | qualifying technique]], [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | listening like a therapist]], positive body language, [[psychological_techniques_for_influencing_women | push and pull]], and creating mystery by telling her a bit and leaving her wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Engaging with Her Friends
A powerful, less common technique is to talk more to the target's friend than to the target herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Most men focus solely on their target, making their interest obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. By engaging with her friends, you make the target feel a bit jealous and curious, as she is not receiving your full attention, making her work for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

#### Example:
*   You: "Hey, are they your friends?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>
*   Her: "Yes, they are." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
*   You: "Be a good girl, introduce me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>
*   She will likely introduce you, at which point you should instantly start talking more to one of her friends and completely avoid her for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This will make your target work harder for your attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

### [[effectiveness_of_playful_interaction_with_women | Physical Touch]]
Physical touch is crucial for attraction, as a playful touch doubles the impact of what you say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. If a woman allows you to touch her, it signifies that her defenses are down, and she is open to further escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

#### Easy Physical Touch Routines:
*   **Hands/Nails**: Stare at her hands, grab her fingers, and playfully comment on her nails, e.g., "Oh, nice nails, but I think they would look better in pink nail polish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.
*   **Forehead**: Stare at her forehead, say she has something on it, and lightly clean it with your fingers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Hair**: Stare at her hair, comment on its color or style, and gently touch it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.
*   **High Five**: Say, "You are cool just like me, we will make a great team, give me a high five," and then give her a gentle high five <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

## Getting Her Contact Information

If you've built sufficient attraction and had a good conversation, getting her phone number should be straightforward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

### The "Curiosity" Method
Transition to an interesting story. Mid-story, mention, "Oh, I just noticed something interesting about you," but continue the story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. When the story ends, she will likely ask what you noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. At this point, check the time and say, "Oh, I'm running late, I have to go" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. Hand her your phone and say, "Here, enter your number. I'll tell you what I noticed and share something else with you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. She will often enter her number because she's interested in continuing the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Handing her your phone also ensures you get the correct number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Handling Challenges with Getting the Number
*   **Incorrect Number**: If she gives a wrong number, call her immediately. If it's wrong, say, "Oh, playing, aren't we?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. If she offers to correct it, refuse by saying, "No, never mind, I don't want it. It was great meeting you," and walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Total Refusal**: If she completely refuses, it means you have not built enough attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. You can try once more with "Come on, giddy up, I don't have much time here," but if she still refuses, say a friendly goodbye and walk off immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.
*   **Providing a Motive**: Always provide a motive for her to give you her number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. For instance, invite her to a party: "My friends are having this party on Saturday... I have free passes, you should come" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Then hand her your phone to punch in her number, saying you'll provide timings later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Randomly asking for a number ("Can I have your phone number?") will typically lead to rejection or a forgettable interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

### Exiting the Venue
The moment you get her phone number, leave the venue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Remaining might make things awkward or reverse the attraction you've built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

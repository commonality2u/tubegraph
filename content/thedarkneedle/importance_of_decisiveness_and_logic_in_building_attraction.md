Attraction is built on a fundamental principle: [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction|Opposites Attract]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This concept goes deeper than superficial physical traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>; it's about the core nature of individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. While friendship forms between similar people, [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships|attraction]] happens when two opposite individuals meet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Historically, the distinction between men and women was natural <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. However, modern societal changes like equality, feminism, and social media have led men to lose their original masculine nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Instead of embracing masculinity, many men now try to think more [[emotional_versus_logical_decision_making_in_attraction|logically]] and find common ground with women to attract them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

In contrast, women's natural essence remains unchanged; they are [[the_role_of_logic_versus_emotion_in_attraction|emotional beings]] who do not control their actions through [[emotional_versus_logical_decision_making_in_attraction|logic]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Therefore, for a man, the key to building attraction is to return to his natural state and embody the opposite traits of a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

## Essential Traits for Men to Cultivate

To create [[psychological_dynamics_of_attraction|sexual electricity]] and foster deep [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships|attraction]], a man must embody traits that are the complete opposite of typical feminine characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### Decisiveness

Indecisiveness is a feminine trait that causes a woman to lose trust in a man's ability to lead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Women are naturally attracted to leaders and men who make decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

*   **Be decisive:** Always know what you want to do, where you want to go, or what you want to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Order quickly in a restaurant:** Unlike a woman who might hesitate, show immediate clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Stick to your decisions:** If a woman suggests you change your choice, do not listen to her; stand firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Non-Romanticism (as the primary source)

Romanticism is a purely feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. While women might *say* they want a romantic man, a man becoming overtly romantic leads to a loss of [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships|attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

*   **Attraction, not source:** A man is naturally attracted to a romantic woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, but he should not be the main source of romance in the relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Enjoy, don't create:** If a woman creates a romantic atmosphere (e.g., candles, flowers), enjoy it, but do not be the one to initiate or set up such gestures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   **Avoid excessive declarations:** Do not shower her with love words or poetry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Believe that you are not a romantic person <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Absence of Jealousy

Jealousy is a feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. A man is attracted to a woman who gets jealous over him, but jealousy is forbidden for a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

*   **No monitoring:** Never ask about who she talks to, follow, or monitor her actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Act as if it doesn't matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Do not react to provocations:** Women sometimes unconsciously try to make a man jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. In these moments, show no reaction; indifference increases her [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships|attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **End, don't possess:** If she is actually cheating, do not get jealous; simply end the relationship and move on. Avoid constantly monitoring or acting possessive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Even if you feel jealous, suppress the emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

### Action, Not Reaction

In a relationship, the woman should always be reacting to your actions, not the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. If her actions can make you react, she is in control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

*   **Maintain composure:** When a girl says harsh things, do not react with anger or lose control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. Be like a rock in a storm; act as if nothing affects you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Apply generally:** This principle should be a general way of life, not just applied with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. For example, if a restaurant has no tables or it starts raining, remain calm and do not get frustrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **Exception:** The only situation where you should react is when your respect is being challenged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### Rationality Over Emotionality/Moodiness

A man is a rational being, while a woman is an [[the_role_of_logic_versus_emotion_in_attraction|emotional being]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Women are moody, and their desires can change quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.

*   **Logic-based decisions:** Your decisions should be based on [[emotional_versus_logical_decision_making_in_attraction|logic]], and changes should only occur for logical reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Do what needs to be done, not just what you feel like doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Appear rational:** Even if you don't always work on self-improvement, ensure you appear rational to women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. For instance, order healthy food when with her or make decisions based on logic, not passing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Avoid mood swings:** Do not tell her you're meeting and then suddenly decide you don't feel like going out, unless you have a valid excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Handle emergencies calmly:** In a crisis, like a near-accident, a man should remain calm, inspect the situation rationally, and discuss it logically, unlike a woman who might panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### Minimal Concern with Appearance

Excessive concern with appearance is a feminine trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Throughout history, caring about physical appearance has been associated with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

*   **Focus on essentials:** A man should focus on three things for appearance: regular exercise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, simple clothes with basic accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>, and personal hygiene (good fragrance, well-groomed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. A simple 3-minute skincare routine is also acceptable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Avoid obsession:** Spending more than 5 minutes a day looking in the mirror will cause women to lose respect for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Do not fall for media deception pushing excessive focus on looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Don't show it:** Even if you enjoy taking care of your looks, do not show it to the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.

By embodying these masculine traits—decisiveness, emotional composure, rationality, and a grounded approach to self-presentation—a man naturally becomes the opposite of a woman, which is the core secret to building deep and lasting [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships|attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

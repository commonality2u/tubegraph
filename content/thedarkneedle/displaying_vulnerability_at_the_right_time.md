Losing a woman's respect is the fastest way to lose her, and also to lose yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. A key factor in maintaining respect and attraction is understanding when and how to display vulnerability.

## The Pitfalls of Seeking Approval

One common mistake is failing to distinguish between seeking advice and seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While women enjoy helping and offering support, which can create a strong emotional bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, many men ask for advice in a way that suggests they are seeking approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

### When Advice Becomes Approval-Seeking

When men ask questions like, "What do you think if I go out with the guys tonight?" or "Do you think I should accept this opportunity?", they are often implicitly asking, "Will this upset you? Will this create tension?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. When decisions are made based on fear of her reaction rather than personal values and principles, respect begins to erode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Women quickly notice when a man's decisions are based on pleasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This loss of respect can happen even if she outwardly seems fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

Seeking approval also makes a man easier to manipulate and more [[overcoming_predictability_in_relationships | predictable]], which women may unconsciously test <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Decisions related to one's own life, such as travel or going out with friends, should not require her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Leadership vs. Followership

In decisions involving both partners, a man must maintain his leadership role. If a man consistently defers to her desires, for example, choosing to go to the pool when he suggested the movies simply because she preferred it, he loses her respect and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Instead, he should state his desire ("I want to go to the movies") and be willing to go alone if she insists on her preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Over time, this assertiveness can lead her to accept his leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. A woman's emotions should not control a man's life or decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Women naturally desire a leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Avoid Sending Signals of Expected Rejection

Another mistake is sending the message that you expect her to reject you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For instance, if she posts a picture with another guy or doesn't reply to a message, starting a conversation with her about it signals insecurity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.

### The Confidence Test

All women, especially in the early stages, instinctively test a man's confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. They will rarely show immediate deep emotional attachment or a desire for a serious relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. A woman is attracted to strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. If a man gets upset because she didn't respond, she gains power over him, which diminishes attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

When a woman tries to give the impression she doesn't want you or is rejecting you, it's often a test of your self-confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. It's crucial not to focus on or discuss these tests, such as delayed replies, attempts to make you jealous, or talk about exes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. This relates directly to [[handling_rejection_and_maintaining_confidence | handling rejection and maintaining confidence]].

### Setting Boundaries

While unconscious testing is common, men must be aware of women who exhibit exaggerated or manipulative testing behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. If a woman is disrespectful or tactless and makes things difficult early in a relationship, it signals toxic or manipulative tendencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Playing her game to build attraction at the cost of your standards will only attract similar types of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Setting clear boundaries and having strong standards signals what you want and that you are prepared to walk away from anything that doesn't match <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. You attract what you *are*, not what you *want* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Leaning Before It's Time

Prematurely leaning on a woman for emotional support and security before she has developed sufficient respect and attraction is a guaranteed way to lose her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. While vulnerability can build intimacy, it's "emotional suicide" if the proper foundation of certainty and trust has not been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Earning Her Nurturing and Support

Women are naturally nurturing and supportive, but this support must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. A high-quality woman will stand by her man if he has proven himself worthy of her support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Displaying weakness too early, before she is fully sure about you, can trigger fear and anxiety in her mind, leading her to test you to determine if it's an isolated incident or a recurring personality trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### The Consequence of Premature Vulnerability

An example illustrates this point: A young man revealed deep emotional vulnerability (crying over his father's casket) to a girl he was interested in, too early in their budding relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. While she sympathized, his emotional display unsettled her due to the premature exposure of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Later, when he tried to prove himself, she tested him by giving an unreasonable request (staying up all night for a song) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. When he fell for the trap, she lost all attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Had he challenged her request or waited for her emotional investment before revealing his deeper side, she wouldn't have been pushed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

In the early stages, some women are not ready to deal with the full spectrum of a man's emotional side <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. While men have insecurities and desire acceptance, exposing deep vulnerability before a woman has witnessed your strength and confidence can backfire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

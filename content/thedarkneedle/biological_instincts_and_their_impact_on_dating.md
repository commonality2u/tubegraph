The contemporary dating landscape, amplified by social media and dating apps, has led to a situation where many women experience inflated egos due to the sheer volume of male attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This often results in women viewing men as inferior if they don't possess certain desirable traits like height, physique, handsomeness, or financial stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. A primary reason men face challenges in their love lives is a lack of [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | proper understanding of dating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Solving dating problems requires understanding their roots, rather than just applying quick fixes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Dating as a Marketplace

Dating, though seemingly complex, can be understood as a marketplace governed by specific "laws" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. These laws are not rigid rules but general principles and patterns that stem from millions of years of human evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Going against these evolutionary currents leads to frustration and confusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The most effective dating strategies align with these fundamental laws, which are rooted in the primal biological instinct to reproduce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

## Evolutionary Roots of Conflict

Men and women have evolved distinct strategies to fulfill the reproductive instinct, and these strategies often conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In early human times:
*   **Men's strategy**: To impregnate as many women as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   **Women's strategy**: To reject many men and secure the commitment of one man who could provide long-term security for a family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Even in the modern "space age," human minds are still influenced by these "Stone Age" primal drives, which have shaped behavior for over a million years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

### The Fundamental Conflict

This evolutionary divergence creates a fundamental conflict:
*   **Women are the gatekeepers of sex** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. They use sex to attract men and secure their commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
*   **Men are the gatekeepers of commitment** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. They use the promise of commitment to attract women and gain a sexual relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

In the relationship market, sex and commitment act as currency, resources exchanged by men and women to achieve their desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, a married woman's desire for intimacy may diminish once she feels the highest level of commitment has been secured, as her biological drive for it lessens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Levels of Commitment (Men's Currency)

For men, commitment is their currency in the dating market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. There are four levels of commitment:
1.  **Attention and Approval**: Sought by women when they first become aware of a man's presence in the dating market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
2.  **Non-Exclusive Dating**: When both parties decide they like each other and start spending time together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.
3.  **Explicit Exclusive Relationship**: When both clearly agree to be in a committed, exclusive relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>.
4.  **Marriage**: The ultimate commitment, often a dream for most women from a young age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## Navigating the Ego Problem

The "ego problem" in dating typically arises at the initial stage, before mutual interest is established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. If a man gives his attention and approval too easily at this point, a woman will not value him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

> "They give women too much attention simply because they find them attractive and desirable leading the woman to undervalue them completely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>

Examples of giving too much attention include:
*   Complimenting her looks immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.
*   Immediately agreeing with everything she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Overloading her with praise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   Giving her significantly more attention than other women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

A man's attention and approval are valuable resources that women desire, so it's crucial to be selective about how easily they are given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Just as a man is not entitled to a woman's body, women are not entitled to a man's attention and approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. These should only be given to a girl who invests her own time and energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This selectivity makes a man valuable and worth pursuing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

## Elevating Your Status

To counter a woman's ego and maintain an elevated position, a man must place a high value on himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. [[Psychology of attraction in relationships | Success with women is primarily a state of mind]]; she will feel what you feel about yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### 1. Winning the Game of Chicken

The "game of chicken" is a challenge where two people head toward each other to see who backs down first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. "Nice guys" tend to back down in conversations and relationships, surrendering their power to be liked, gain approval, ease tension, or avoid conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. When you value another person more than yourself, you will always concede first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.

Examples of "blinking" or surrendering:
*   Panicking and backpedaling when a woman's tone suggests you've said something wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   Morphing into a "nice guy" to prove you're not a "player" when a woman expresses disdain for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   Having your mind go blank when a woman yawns or frowns, fearing you've annoyed her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   Hesitating to kiss a girl because you're unsure if she wants to be kissed, valuing her potential desire over your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a> "People notice and respect you instantly when they realize they can't intimidate you."
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a> "When a beautiful woman senses that you're not intimidated by her, she assumes you're better than her."

The reason "players" often succeed with women is because women know they cannot control them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. A man's status is defined by his attitude towards himself and women, his confidence, and his courage to never back down first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Women infer a man's true status and attractiveness from his attitude and behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

For instance, if a woman dislikes a YouTuber you enjoy, you don't need to justify your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Justifying your opinions or interests signals that her opinion of you matters more than your own self-perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### 2. Communicating from a Position of Implicit Status (Non-Reactive)

To communicate confidence and power without seeming arrogant, the best approach is to be non-reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

**Reactive Communication Example**:
If a girl comments, "I don't understand why guys wear sneakers to bars, you'd look so much better in a pair of shoes," a reactive response would be: "Actually, a lot of girls like these sneakers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This shows she controlled your communication style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Even a seemingly "clever" or "edgy" comeback is still a reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Similarly, getting nervous and over-explaining or immediately complimenting her back when she compliments you is reactive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

**Non-Reactive Communication Example**:
When a girl comments on your sneakers, a non-reactive response is to stay completely calm and simply say, "Thanks for the advice," then continue the conversation as if nothing significant was said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. If she compliments you, a simple "Thanks, that's kind of you," followed by continuing the conversation, conveys high status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. A woman notices and is attracted when you are unaffected by what she says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

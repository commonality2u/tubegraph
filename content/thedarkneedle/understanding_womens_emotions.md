To connect deeply with women and foster attraction, the key is to [[emotional_vs_rational_communication_with_women | speak to her emotions, not her mind]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">. This principle was discovered after years of studying [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | seduction girls]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02"> and social skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">.

## The Three Categories of Men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">

When a young man interacts with a woman, her mind quickly categorizes him into one of three roles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">:
*   Potential boyfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">
*   Friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">
*   Someone she doesn't want to meet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">

The speaker initially found himself in the third category due to social awkwardness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27"> and introversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">. After learning social skills, he moved to the "friend" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">. The pivotal shift to the "boyfriend" category occurred upon understanding [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | how women think]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54"> and recognizing that the difference between a friend and a boyfriend is *emotion* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">. To be seen as a boyfriend, one must know how to stir her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">.

## Stirring Emotions: Bringing Feelings Out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">

There are two potential ways to stir emotions: either feelings are entered into her, or they are brought out of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">.
Initially, a woman's emotions are locked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">. It is not possible to directly "put feelings into her" from the start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">. The effective method is to "bring them out" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">. The moment a woman expresses feelings, the door to her emotions is opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">.

## The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">

This technique is used to make a woman express her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">. It involves asking [[effective_communication_and_decisionmaking_with_women | emotional questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54"> and listening to the answers like a therapist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">.

### What are Emotional Questions? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">

Emotional questions are those that prompt a woman to express her feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">, which can include anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, passion, or other strong sentiments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">. The goal is to make the other person talk in an [[effective_communication_and_decisionmaking_with_women | emotional way]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">.

**Contrast with Logical Communication**:
*   **Logical Communication**: Discussing facts or practical matters in a "cold way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">. For example, asking about a job and getting a factual description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">. These conversations are easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">.
*   **Emotional Communication**: Asking "why" she likes or dislikes something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">. This prompts her to express inner feelings, leading to more extensive and emotional dialogue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">.

**Conditions for Emotional Questions**:
1.  **Makes her express feelings**: The question should elicit an emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">.
2.  **Prompts a long, expressive answer**: If the initial answer is short, follow up with "why?" to encourage deeper expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">. This allows her to "pour out her feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">.

### Active Listening and Emotional Conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">

Once a woman begins expressing herself, the second step is to listen carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">.
*   Encourage her to express herself as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">.
*   Listen without interrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">.
*   When she shares her story, you are speaking to her emotions, specifically "that instinct responsible for love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">.

The emotional question is merely a "key" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48"> to unlock an "emotional conversation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">. After she expresses herself, transition the conversation by focusing on details she shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22"> and always encouraging her to talk about emotional things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">. The goal is to immerse her emotions in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">. These conversations are remembered for years because they stir emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">.

### Avoiding "Interview Mode" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">

A common mistake is falling into "interview mode," where one continuously asks questions without connecting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">. Questions should be related and complement each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">.

### Conversation Ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">

In a conversation with a woman, she should talk 70% of the time, and you should talk only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">, especially in the beginning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">. Always let her talk a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">.

## Examples of Emotional Questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">

Social psychology researcher Arthur Aaron created a list of "36 Questions to Fall in Love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">. In an experiment, 100 participants (man/woman pairs) who didn't know each other asked these questions, resulting in significant attraction and some even marrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">. These questions aim to reveal personal details and intimacy-related behaviors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">. They are structured in three sets, with intensity gradually increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">.

**First 10 Questions from Arthur Aaron's List**:
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">?
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">?
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">?
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">?
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">?
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">?
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">?
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">?
9.  What is your most terrible memory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">?
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">?

It is crucial to understand the *concept* behind these questions, not just memorize them, to be able to create your own emotional questions based on circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">. The secret is knowing how to turn a regular conversation into an [[effective_conversation_techniques_with_women | emotional one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">.

## The Link Between Emotions and Attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">

A personal story illustrates this link: A woman who had a firm boundary against sex on the first few dates ended up having sex after the speaker engaged her in an MBTI personality test, making her elaborate and tell stories about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">.

**Key Lessons**:
1.  **Gender Differences in Sexual Desire**: For men, sexual desire is primarily triggered visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">. For women, sexual desire is triggered when they start experiencing emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">, especially if you are the source of these emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">.
2.  **Creativity**: Do not be robotic; adapt the approach creatively rather than just asking a fixed list of questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">.

### Caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">

Applying only this technique may lead to the "therapy zone," where you are seen as a confidant but not a romantic partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">. It is essential to implement all concepts from this series on [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | how to attract women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">.

This approach can also be used to create deep and memorable connections with anyone, not just romantic interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">.

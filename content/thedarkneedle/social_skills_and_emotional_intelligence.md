After years of study, it was discovered that to connect with someone, one must speak to their emotions, not just their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The quickest way to achieve this is through a technique called "listen like a therapist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Impact of Social Skills

Initial interactions with a person lead to them being categorized into one of three groups: potential partner, friend, or someone not desired for future meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The speaker, initially being socially awkward and introverted, often fell into the "doesn't want to meet again" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. By beginning to learn [[improving_social_skills_as_a_practice | social skills]], they became socially acceptable, moving into the "friend" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. The key to moving from the "friend" category to a romantic interest is emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. One must know how to stir and speak to another's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

## Stirring Emotions

There are two primary ways to stir emotions and feelings:
1.  **Entering feelings into someone**: This method is generally not possible at the beginning of an interaction as people often have a "lock" on their emotional door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Bringing feelings out of someone**: This is the initial approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The moment one encourages someone to express feelings, the door to their emotions opens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

To make someone express feelings, the "listen like a therapist" technique is used by asking emotional questions and listening attentively to the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

#### Emotional Questions

An emotional question is one that prompts the other person to express their feelings, such as anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, or passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. For example, instead of just asking about a job (logical communication), asking *why* they like or dislike their field leads to expressing internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

To be effective, an emotional question should meet two conditions:
1.  **Elicit feelings**: It must encourage the person to express their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
2.  **Prompt a long, expressive answer**: The answer should be detailed and reveal more about their feelings, not just a simple "yes" or "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. If the answer is short, follow up by asking "why?" to encourage further expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

The goal is to understand how to create emotional questions based on the circumstances, rather than just memorizing a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

#### Active Listening

Once an emotional question is asked and the person begins to express themselves, the second step is to listen carefully without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This means focusing on getting them to express as much as possible, as this communicates directly with their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

#### Turning Questions into Conversation

An emotional question is merely a key to unlock a larger emotional conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. After the initial question and expression, transition from one emotional topic to another, always focusing on allowing the person to talk about things that immerse their emotions in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. This creates a memorable connection that lasts much longer than logical, cold conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Avoiding Interview Mode

A common mistake is falling into "interview mode," where one continuously asks questions without building a natural flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Questions should be related and complement each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Conversation Balance

In a conversation, especially at the beginning, the other person should ideally be talking 70% of the time, while you talk only 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Always allow them to talk a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.

### Examples of Emotional Questions

Arthur Aaron, a social psychology researcher, created a list of "36 questions to fall in love" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. His experiment involved pairing unknown individuals and having them ask each other these questions, resulting in significant attraction and even relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. These questions aim to reveal personal details and increase intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The questions are divided into three sets, with intensity gradually increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Examples of the first 10 questions:
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

The essence is [[understanding_social_skills_through_psychology | understanding the concept]] behind these questions to transform regular conversations into emotional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Sexual Desire and Emotion

For men, sexual desire is often triggered visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. For women, sexual desire arises when they begin experiencing emotions, especially if the interaction partner is the source of those emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This highlights the [[impact_of_social_skills_on_relationships | importance of emotional connection]] in romantic contexts.

## Creativity in Application

It's crucial to be creative in applying these techniques rather than appearing robotic or simply asking questions from a list <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. A simple personality test like MBTI (Myers-Briggs Type Indicator) can be used as a framework to ask questions and encourage elaboration, fostering emotional connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

This approach is not limited to romantic interactions; it can also be used with anyone to create a deep and memorable connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

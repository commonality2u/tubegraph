Women share a fundamental, instinctual trait: the desire to gain the approval of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. This trait is deeply rooted in their genes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>. Evidence for this can be seen in their daily lives, from the prevalence of advertisements for weight loss, skincare, and makeup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, to the hours they spend on their appearance and beauty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>.

## The Key to Her Heart: Making Her Seek Your Approval

As a man, if you can "feed" this instinct, the woman becomes yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. A consistent principle in [[psychology_of_attracting_women | attracting women]] is that if you make a woman strive to gain *your* approval, she is yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. This rule is considered the key to every girl's heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>.

The goal is to put her in a state where she is the one who wants to gain your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. While this might seem intimidating, it's one of the easiest things to achieve because this instinct is already within her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. You just need to go with the flow, not against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

### The Mindset: Not Seeking Her Approval

Relationships, especially dating, are governed by emotion, not logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Therefore, the first fundamental rule is that you should not try to impress the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. One of the most [[personality_traits_that_make_women_attached | attractive traits]] in a man to a woman is that he isn't overly concerned with gaining her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.

However, many men face a challenge: the modern world has placed such a high value on women that men often feel a subconscious pressure to earn her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. This internal pressure drives you to want to gain the girl's approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a>.

To counteract this programming, you must acknowledge this internal pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. Once you are aware of it, you can control how to direct it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Instead of trying to change the action (e.g., telling her "I'm awesome"), you need to redirect the pressure itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.

> "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>

This shift in mindset allows you to overcome the pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. When you stop trying to gain her approval, you create the space for her to want to gain yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

## The Recipe to Trigger Her Desire for Approval

The recipe to make a woman want your approval consists of two ingredients:
1.  **Not giving her validation immediately** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
2.  **Telling her what you like in a girl** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>.

A woman inherently craves admiration and validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. For her to earn *your* validation, you must not give it to her easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. If you give it immediately, it ends the "game" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. This means:
*   Don't like every post she shares on social media <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   Don't comment on everything she posts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>.
*   Don't appear obsessed with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

When you don't give her validation, her internal instincts activate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. She'll begin to think: "Why isn't he giving me validation? I need to make him admire me. How do I do that? I have to do what he said he likes in girls." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. This thought process leads her to actively pursue your admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

### Conditions for Success

To effectively implement this strategy, there are several conditions to follow:

#### 1. Partial Alignment (40/60 Rule)
When you express what you like in a girl's personality or appearance, a small portion (around 40%) of what you like should already be present in her, but 60% should not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. This prevents you from appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Most attractive girls receive constant validation, so by withholding it when she doesn't meet your stated preferences, you stand out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

#### 2. General Expression of Opinion
When stating your preferences, speak in a general way that simply reflects your opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. Do not follow up with direct commands (e.g., "You should cut your hair") or convey that you're telling her what you like so she can do it to earn your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. Talk casually and avoid directing your words at her specifically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:46:00">[08:46:00]</a>. She will automatically apply it to herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a>.

#### 3. Non-Reaction to Mundane Acts
Do not react to anything she does simply because she did it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. Many men make the mistake of laughing at dull jokes or reacting enthusiastically just because the girl is beautiful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>. If she says something dull or silly, do not laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>. This will make her feel a little embarrassed or uncomfortable, which is necessary for attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>.

> "Never let a girl feel that anything she does will impress you." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>

Convey that your admiration requires her to have unique and exceptional qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:50:00">[10:50:00]</a>.

#### 4. Curiosity, Not Admiration
When asking a girl questions or trying to get to know her, your approach should come from a place of curiosity, not admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Reflect this in your body language and tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Internally feel that you're asking purely out of curiosity, as if you haven't yet decided whether or not you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>.

Additionally, never put yourself in a position where a girl interrogates you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:53:00">[11:53:00]</a>. This gives her control of the conversation and makes her judge you, which goes against [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | natural dynamics]] where you are the man who chooses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>. Avoid this by giving short answers or shifting the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>.

#### 5. Countering Her Attempts to Impress
When a girl begins trying to win your approval by highlighting her positive traits (e.g., "I practice Taekwondo," "I read books") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>, your internal pressure to impress her might be triggered if you share something in common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

Do not reciprocate by boasting about your similar accomplishments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. Instead, either comment casually or, ideally, make it seem like you are bad at the thing she is trying to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. For example, if she says she has a black belt in Taekwondo, you could say, "I tried it once and I almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>. This gives her the space to try to impress you and showcase her capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>.

By combining and applying these techniques, you can create a strong desire in the woman to win your approval, putting her in a state where she actively tries to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>.

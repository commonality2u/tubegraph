From: [[thedarkneedle]] <br/> 

As a man, there are three common approaches to relationships with women: being the "nice guy," being the "bad boy," or adopting a balanced approach described as "half bad, half nice" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The "nice guy" often ends up in the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, while the "bad boy" experiences many breakups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The "half bad, half nice" man, referred to as "the gentleman," can make women deeply fall in love and think about him constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>, achieving a balance without falling into the "nice guy" trap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Principle of Exceptions in [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | Attraction]]

Our brains naturally pay attention to exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This applies to all social relationships, not just interactions with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.

> [!INFO] Example Analogy
> If you see a white image with a single white dot, you focus on the dot and ignore the black background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Conversely, if you see a black image with a single black dot, you focus on the black dot, ignoring the white background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>.

Similarly, if you are always kind to a friend and then make one mistake, that mistake becomes the "black dot" that overshadows all your previous good deeds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. People will only remember the mistake and their resentment will grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. Conversely, a generally unpleasant person who does one good thing may be praised as great <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>.

You will not gain respect by constantly serving or being kind to others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. It is more effective to be like a "black page that occasionally shows white spots" than a "white page that occasionally shows black spots" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

## Applying the Principle to Women

If you are always nice to a woman, she will not see your kindness as special or appreciate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. However, if you behave normally or even indifferently, and only occasionally do something nice, these gestures will stand out and increase her attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This is the distinction between the "nice guy" (always white with occasional black dots) and "the gentleman" (black with occasional white dots) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

When a woman perceives you as a high-value man due to your confidence and self-worth (derived from not being overly nice), your occasional kind gestures become exceptions that she focuses on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. These memories can last for days, weeks, or even a lifetime, increasing her love and [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

## Two Fundamental Points for [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | Interacting with Women]]

To be a high-value man without being overly nice, yet still a gentleman, focus on two key areas: attention and requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

### 1. [[the_importance_of_attention_and_how_to_manage_it_effectively | Attention]]

A common misconception is that women love abundant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. Conversely, completely withholding attention is only suitable for short-term, limited interactions like a one-night stand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. For long-term, healthy relationships, you must not give attention all the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. There must be a balance: give attention in some situations, withhold it in others, and remain neutral at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. This is known as the [[balancing_interest_and_indifference_in_interactions | balance of attention]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The Golden Rule of Attention
> Every time you give a woman attention, you must stop giving it afterward. Never overdo it, or it will lose its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>.

Your decision to give or withhold attention depends on the type of emotions involved and their cause <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Here are five possibilities:

*   **Woman feels negative emotions because of you**: If you caused her negative feelings (e.g., jealousy from talking to another woman, anger from your mistake), you should give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.
*   **You feel negative emotions because of her**: If her actions cause you negative emotions (e.g., she posts a picture with another guy, smokes knowing you dislike it), you must *not* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. Do not show anger or affectation; ignore the situation completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>. If she messages you, reply normally but do not give extra attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>.
*   **Woman feels positive emotions because of you**: If you made her happy (e.g., took her to a nice place), you should *not* give her too much attention afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. For example, if you take her on an expensive dinner, don't text her later that night <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.
*   **You feel positive emotions because of her**: If she does something that makes *you* happy (e.g., wears an attractive outfit, buys you a gift), you *should* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>.
*   **Emotions not related to you**: If she experiences positive or negative emotions that have nothing to do with you (e.g., work problems, family issues), you should remain neutral and *not* give her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. Do not try to cheer her up with gifts or outings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>. Giving her attention every time she feels bad will place you in the "therapy zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:37:00">[07:37:00]</a>. If she's your girlfriend, listen and talk kindly, but avoid excessive attention or overdoing help, as women experience many daily emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

By applying this pattern, you will mostly remain neutral, giving attention only occasionally, which increases her [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

### 2. Requests

When a woman makes a request, it falls into one of two categories: a test to gauge your strength or manipulability, or a genuine desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.

#### Direct Orders (Tests)

Women often use direct orders (e.g., "Hold this for me," "Wait here," "Give me a kiss") in the early stages of interaction to see if you are easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

*   **Refuse if inconvenient or senseless**: If the request is inconvenient or makes no sense (e.g., "Go buy me something"), you must refuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. A calm "no" is sufficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.
*   **Accept on your own terms**: If the request doesn't bother you or makes no sense to refuse (e.g., "Take our picture," "Give me a kiss"), do not accept directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. Instead, accept with your own conditions, shifting the power dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If she says "Take our picture," respond with "Okay, but I want you to give me your best silly sexy gangster face, ready, go!" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>
    *   *Example*: If she says "Wait for me here," respond with "Cool, I can wait, but I'm actually going to be over there. Come find me when you get back" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

#### Indirect Expressions of Feelings (Genuine Requests)

Women often express desires indirectly by mentioning things they love (e.g., "I love the beach," "I love pizza") instead of direct requests like "I want to go to the beach" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>.

*   **Delay fulfilling the wish**: To avoid being seen as an overly eager or submissive man, delay acting on these indirect requests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.
    *   *Example*: If she mentions loving burritos during a date, don't immediately take her for one. Instead, surprise her with a burrito a few weeks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>.

Delaying shows thoughtfulness, proves you listen, and makes you unpredictable, which women appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Take note of her preferences but fulfill them at unexpected moments, showing strength and avoiding submission to her whims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:23:00">[11:23:00]</a>. Be kind but firm, making it clear that she gets what she wants when you decide to give it, not when she demands or complains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.

By mastering these approaches to attention and requests, you can be nice without losing your masculinity and effectively [[overcoming_rejection_and_maintaining_attraction | increase attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>.

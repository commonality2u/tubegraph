When interacting with women, there are specific actions to take and others to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Even a man as charming as Brad Pitt can fail if he makes certain [[mistakes to avoid when attracting women | mistakes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Case Study: A Young Man's Missteps

Consider the story of a young man who repeatedly failed to connect with a woman he was interested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

> He first saw her reading in a park but hesitated, paralyzed by negative thoughts, until she left <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. Determined, he returned daily, but this pattern of paralysis repeated for several days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.
>
> When he finally approached her a week later, he fumbled for words and awkwardly asked about her book <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Their conversations remained short and stilted due to his anxiety, as he struggled to maintain her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
>
> After eventually securing a few dates, he became increasingly attached and insecure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. His thoughts were consumed by whether she liked him, and his emotions swung with her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Feeling overwhelmed, he confessed his feelings too early, only to be told she saw him "just as a friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. He continued to pursue her, but she firmly declined further dates, valuing their friendship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. She eventually distanced herself, spending less time in the park and becoming preoccupied during their brief interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

This young man exhibited several traits of a "low value male," which ultimately sabotaged his chances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

## Common [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | Mistakes Men Make]]

Here are some specific [[mistakes to avoid when attracting women | mistakes]] men commonly make when interacting with women:

### 1. Putting Her on a Pedestal Solely for Her Looks
A common [[misconceptions_about_women_and_attraction | misconception]] is to give a woman too much importance just because she is good-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Showing a woman that you consider her "too good-looking" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Convey that you value personality over looks, as personality is a rare trait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This approach can make you seem like a "special, different guy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

### 2. Agreeing Too Much to Keep Her Comfortable
Kissing up to a woman and agreeing with everything she says gives off a weak vibe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Constantly agreeing with her, which suggests you seek her approval or permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This communicates a lack of self-worth and fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Understand that women desire a challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Constant agreement will never provide that challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>.

### 3. Desperately Seeking Her Approval and Acceptance
Seeking a woman's approval is a strong attraction killer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Letting a girl realize you are seeking her approval, as this will turn her off instantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Don't talk too much; let her do most of the talking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Make the conversation about her, not yourself, to avoid focusing on convincing her you're the best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This is key for [[effective_communication_with_women | effective communication]].

### 4. Making Intentions Clear Too Early
Confessing your true feelings or saying "I love you" too early can kill attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Being the first to confess your feelings, as she might feel she has "conquered" you, leading to a loss of tension and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Keep her guessing about your feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Maintaining an element of confusion and insecurity ensures the attraction remains present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This relates to [[setting_clear_intents_in_interactions_with_women | setting clear intentions]].

### 5. Trying to Solve Her Problems
This is one of the quickest ways to end up in the "friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Solving her problems for her, as this places you in the "provider zone," similar to a big brother <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It subtly communicates low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Women generally discuss issues to be heard, not to get a solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Be a good listener, but trust that she can handle her own problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### 6. Acting Too Disinterested
There's a fine line between being disinterested and being rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Showing complete disinterest, which can come across as telling her to "go away" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Show a mix of interest and slight disinterest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. For example, compliment her dress but suggest another color might have been better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This balances showing you're interested without chasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, contributing to [[creating_playful_and_fun_interactions_with_women | playful interactions]].

### 7. Discussing Your Problems or Insecurities
Sharing your problems or insecurities can kill attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Discussing your issues, failures, or struggles, as this can give a dull impression and imply weakness or a need for sympathy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Women want to see you overcome challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. If you must mention a weakness, do so humorously, making fun of yourself to show you don't care about her opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

### 8. Always Giving a Direct "Yes"
Being too easy for a woman can reduce her investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Constantly saying "yes" to requests, even when you might prefer to say "no" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Make her work a little for a "yes" response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Set conditions or make her request more before agreeing to non-urgent matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Always prioritize urgent requests, though <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### 9. Letting Her Get You Mad or Upset
Reacting with anger or losing your cool signals a lack of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Avoid:** Getting mad or upset over her actions, as this shows she controls your reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Instead:** Remain calm and composed, like a "rock in the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. Often, a girl might be testing your reaction in extreme situations; failing this test means you reacted predictably <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

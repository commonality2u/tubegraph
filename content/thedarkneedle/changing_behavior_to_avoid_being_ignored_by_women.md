If you consistently find yourself ignored or chasing women without receiving any attention, it indicates a significant problem that needs to be addressed through a shift in personal behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This issue is not resolved by financial status, physical appearance, or self-improvement efforts alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. The fundamental issue lies in the way one interacts with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## The Root Cause of Being Ignored: Neediness

The primary reason women ignore men is "neediness," which is considered the number one killer of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This doesn't mean explicitly stating "I need you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. Instead, neediness is felt when a man makes an overt effort to impress a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

When a man desires a woman's approval, he steps out of his natural self, making conscious efforts to adjust his posture, speech, or actions to appear "special" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This "effort" signals a "need" for the woman, similar to how hunger drives effort to obtain food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The moment a woman perceives this effort and deviation from one's natural state, she instinctively begins to ignore him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Conversely, men often find that women they don't pursue or feel indifferent towards are the ones who show interest, precisely because they are simply being themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Avoiding Common Mistakes
Manipulative tactics often suggested online, such as delaying replies, blocking, or being purposefully late for dates, are not genuine solutions. While they might occasionally work, women frequently recognize them as inauthentic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. The real solution involves making a woman feel you don't need her by remaining natural and genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

## Strategies for Behavioral Change

To stop being ignored, focus on these key behaviors:

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Seeking Approval
Prioritize enjoying your time and being detached from the outcome of the interaction, without caring about a woman's opinion or societal standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

Examples of natural, unconcerned behavior that can [[creating_playful_and_fun_interactions_with_women | create playful and fun interactions with women]]:
*   **Playful Teasing:** Lightly tapping a woman's head with a plastic bottle and saying "Shh" in a playful manner demonstrates a lack of concern for her immediate judgment, similar to how one might act with a close friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This shows you're being yourself and enjoying the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.
*   **Treating as a "Kid":** Playfully patting a woman on the head and saying "Good girl" when she does a small favor, as if she were a child, demonstrates an uninhibited nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Humorous Responses to Flaws:** If a woman shares a poor test score, respond humorously ("You're so stupid!" while laughing) rather than consoling her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Similarly, if she falls, laugh with her (assuming no serious injury) instead of worrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Personal Habits:** If you smoke and she complains, simply state you'll finish your current cigarette or offer a brief response, allowing her to move away if she chooses, rather than altering your behavior to accommodate her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. This illustrates that you don't adjust your actions based on her preferences, signifying independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

### 2. Avoid Overextending Yourself
Do not make special efforts or change your lifestyle to impress a woman, as this indicates neediness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

*   **Date Locations:** Choose date spots that are part of your regular life, similar to where you'd go with a friend, especially for early dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This shows she is an addition to your life, not its central focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Appearance:** Dress normally and simply, avoiding exaggerated outfits or excessive grooming for a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This conveys comfort and a lack of effort to impress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Accepting Flaws:** Don't try to hide or fake abilities you lack <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. If criticized, acknowledge it and laugh rather than getting defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Resisting Standards:** Do not change yourself to meet a woman's stated preferences (e.g., "I like guys who go to the gym") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Instead, acknowledge her preference with a joke, demonstrating that you won't chase her standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

### 3. Never Compete for Her Attention
Engaging in competition with other men for a woman's approval immediately signals insecurity and neediness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Avoid One-Upping:** Do not try to tell a better joke or story, or be the sole focus of attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. Stay calm and natural, as if women weren't present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
*   **Elevate Other Men:** Appreciate and support other men in the group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Laugh at their jokes, highlight their value, and acknowledge their impressive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. Women notice this non-competitive, confident behavior, perceiving it as a sign of self-assurance rather than a desire to impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.
*   **Avoid Jealousy:** If a woman you like is with another man, do not ask about him or show jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Introduce to Better-Looking Friends:** As an advanced technique, introducing a woman to a more attractive friend can demonstrate extreme self-confidence and a complete lack of jealousy, making her think about you more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

### 4. Exhibit Authentic Body Language
Your body language should naturally reflect comfort and relaxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

*   **Prioritize Comfort:** Do not overthink specific postures or movements suggested online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. Simply be comfortable, whether that means putting hands in pockets, leaning back, or stretching out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.
*   **Natural Movement:** Walk and move in a way that feels natural to you, without trying to force an overly deliberate or "masculine" gait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

By applying these behaviors, you project an image of a man who does not need a woman's validation and is not making an effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This eliminates the opportunity for her to ignore you, as you haven't given her a reason to in the first place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

The ability to talk to any woman, anytime and anywhere, can be unlocked through a "magic phrase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This phrase provides extraordinary power in conversations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## The Pitfalls of Question-Based Introductions

The initial introduction phase of a conversation, where individuals try to get to know each other, is often the most challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. During this stage, men frequently lose their attractiveness even before the conversation truly begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

A common mistake is for men to immediately bombard women with questions, which are typically boring "get to know you" inquiries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Asking too many questions bores the woman and prevents her from actively engaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This approach often leads to men jumping from one question to another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>, and, critically, it gives the woman power in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

A typical question-and-answer exchange (e.g., "What's your name?" "What is your job?") is inherently dull for both parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. In such scenarios, the man attempts to make the conversation enjoyable, while the woman either waits for him to leave or to make the exchange interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This inevitably leads to the woman becoming bored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## The Power of Statements

To prevent boredom and make a woman want to talk, listen, and participate, the conversation must be enjoyable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This can be achieved with a single sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The golden rule is to [[how_to_structure_conversations_with_women | use statements instead of questions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

Instead of entering an "interview mode," reframing questions as statements allows you to add substance to the conversation rather than merely requesting information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>. This approach encourages people to open up and share more about themselves without feeling interrogated or pressured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

Consider conversations with friends or family: they rarely involve many questions, but rather consist of statements, stories, and jokes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. By speaking in statements, you can create the same feelings of familiarity and comfort with someone you've just met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.

### Crafting the "Magic Phrase"

The rule for creating the magic phrase is simple: anytime you think of asking a question, turn it into a statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

The "magic phrase" involves two key components:

1.  **Focus on the Woman (The Subject)**: The subject of the statement should be the woman herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. People, especially women, love to talk about themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. By opening a topic about her, you immediately increase her interest in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Unlike a direct question, which only requests information, a statement about her opens a topic that matters to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

2.  **Incorporate Cold Reads/Assumptions**: The statement should include a reasonable and accurate assumption about her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This is the second component of the magic sentence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

    *   **Example 1**: Instead of "Where are you from?" say "You don't seem like you're from here, are you European?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>
        *   If the assumption is correct, she becomes curious how you knew and more interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
        *   If the assumption is wrong, she'll be curious why you made that assumption and become interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
        *   In both cases, she starts thinking and wondering about your assumption, which significantly increases her interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

    *   **Example 2**: Instead of "What do you do?" say "You seem like a creative person, I bet you work in design" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   **Example 3**: Instead of "Where did you grow up?" say "You don't seem like you grew up around here" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Women enjoy hearing opinions about themselves and will be interested in knowing what led you to your guess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Sharing your observations about her is highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

By using statements, the conversation transforms from you trying to impress her and asking questions to her wanting to ask you and learn why you said what you said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This makes the conversation much more interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.

## Elevating Interest with Emotions

While the "magic phrase" will make a woman interested, another crucial element is needed for a successful conversation: **emotions** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. [[emphasizing_emotions_over_facts_in_conversations | Emotional connection]] with women is not built on words, but on feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

To build an emotional connection:
*   **Go deeper than surface-level facts**: Instead of asking basic questions like "Which university did she attend?" or "Why did she move?", explore her feelings and emotions about these experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. Ask how she *felt* about her university experience or if it influenced her life's direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Explore their emotional world**: Instead of asking a doctor about long working hours, ask what motivates her sacrifices or how it feels to save a life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Ask about their greatest achievements, biggest mistakes, or what they'd do with only one week to live <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Lead by example**: To encourage women to open up, share something deep and personal about yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. By sharing your own dreams and aspirations, you demonstrate leadership and create genuine attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.
*   **Focus on feelings, not facts**: Look for the emotions underneath the facts and connect those feelings with your own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Choose emotionally resonant topics**: Topics like childhood memories, travel, and music are excellent for casual conversations because they tend to put women in an emotional state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. When both individuals are in a highly charged emotional state, connecting becomes much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

By combining the "magic phrase" with an emphasis on emotions, you can significantly enhance a woman's interest and engagement in the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

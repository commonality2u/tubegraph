[[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attraction]] is instinctive and has nothing to do with logic or modern-day principles [00:00:27]. The number one trait a woman seeks in a man is his ability to survive [00:00:31]. A way of speaking known as impedence can make a woman chase you [00:00:05].

## What is Impedence?
Impudence is defined as a lack of modesty or boldness, accompanied by a slight disregard for others [00:00:09]. While it may seem negative, in a woman's eyes, an impudent man is perceived as capable of survival [00:00:19]. This connection to survival instincts is illustrated by imagining a plane crash on an island: the selfish, harsh individual who thinks only of himself is most likely to survive, and women would compete to be with such a person [00:00:39].

A woman is genetically wired to seek the impudent man [00:01:21]. Even in modern times, where physical survival is less critical, these rules still apply [00:01:29]. Impedence and boldness are traits that can make a woman deeply love and become attached to a man [00:01:43]. Showing this boldness and impedence, especially early on, through your speech, can lead to obsessive attachment [00:01:51]. This must be done with moderation and intelligence [00:02:02].

## Elements of Impedence in Conversation
Impedence in conversation is comprised of four key elements:

### 1. Be a Little Cheeky
Being cheeky involves being a little mischievous in your manner [00:02:25]. The goal is to make a woman wonder, "Did he really just say that or do that?" [00:02:28]. This approach aims to break the "boredom trance" [00:02:36] that women often experience due to formal interactions with strangers [00:02:43]. By being different, you interrupt her usual pattern and grab her attention [00:02:51].

Most men try to be overly careful and formal, which makes them come across as strangers, preventing physical attraction or emotional connection [00:03:07]. Neutrality is a weakness [00:03:36]; if you disagree with a woman, state it directly and maintain your position [00:03:31]. Influential people are often extreme in their opinions, not neutral [00:03:49].

One effective method to be cheeky and avoid seeming neutral is to offer unsolicited advice [00:04:10]. For example, telling a blonde-haired woman she'd look beautiful with black hair is an unexpected comment that creates an emotional response because it's surprising and a little edgy [00:04:20].

### 2. Be Bold
Boldness is considered the most attractive trait to all humans, not just women [00:05:52]. It involves taking risks, whether real or potential for embarrassment, without overthinking the consequences [00:06:08]. The key is to live fully in the present, focusing energy on the action itself [00:06:16].

With women, you must be bold and take the first step, whether initiating conversation, flirting, or making a physical move like holding her hand [00:06:26]. Bold actions, even simple ones, significantly impact those around you [00:06:37]. People are drawn to bold individuals because they do the unexpected, unlike shy people who fear risk [00:06:58].

Examples of demonstrating boldness in conversation include:
*   Telling a girl who is talking too much or raising her voice, "Shut your trap" [00:07:24]. This is a phrase typically reserved for close friends, making it shocking to a stranger [00:07:30].
*   Directly addressing a girl who is looking at you by saying, "I just totally caught you staring at me" [00:08:05]. This is a playful yet bold statement that pulls her out of her usual reality where men "walk on eggshells" around her [00:08:21].

The sooner you are bold in a conversation, the more you can set the tone for an emotionally charged, [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attractive]] interaction [00:08:37].

### 3. Be Shameless
[[techniques_for_qualifying_and_attracting_women | Women are attracted to men who are shameless]] [00:08:52]. Attractive shamelessness means having the courage to say things as they are and voicing what you are thinking [00:09:14]. It's about saying what's not typically supposed to be said, similar to a child openly stating an observation everyone else is thinking but is too polite to mention [00:09:31].

However, this must be done smartly, not stupidly. Do not make hurtful comments, such as laughing at someone's weight or a physical disability [00:09:48].

Smart shamelessness involves:
*   Referencing something she said earlier and expressing your true feelings about it, such as "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive" [00:10:02].
*   Asking personal, yet non-offensive, questions that break social norms, like asking a group of girls if "girls night" means they "don't shave your legs?" [00:10:19]. This can lead to deeper, more intimate conversations [00:10:27].
*   Openly commenting on obvious observations, such as telling your girlfriend you didn't see her because she's short and then laughing about it [00:10:51]. This shows you are not ashamed to state what comes to mind [00:11:13].
*   "Connecting the dots" by filling in what she left out of a story, such as suggesting a dating app failure was due to "no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" [00:11:34].

It is crucial to learn to always point out the "elephant in the room," especially in mixed groups, by saying what everyone is thinking but is too shy to express [00:11:44].

### 4. Be Slightly Disrespectful
To fully master impedence, you must be slightly disrespectful, which means giving a woman the same level of respect you would give your best friends, not being insulting [00:12:00]. Most men treat women with excessive respect, like an "elementary school principal," walking on eggshells and preventing any emotional reaction [00:12:27]. This "over respect" can lead a woman to believe she is superior [00:12:48].

Ways to be slightly disrespectful include:
*   Not responding directly to her questions immediately [00:13:02]. If she asks "Where did you grow up?" you could respond with "Oh, so last night I was out..." [00:13:15]. You can return to her question later, but this establishes that she is not controlling the conversation and makes the interaction less linear and more interesting [00:13:38].
*   Creating a gap in the conversation where she asks a question and you don't immediately answer, opening a space for surprise and unpredictability [00:13:54]. This triggers [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attraction]] by creating an emotional reaction and making her feel she has to "win you over," rather than you submitting just because she is pretty [00:14:04].

By applying these principles of being cheeky, bold, shameless, and slightly disrespectful, a man can plant the idea that he is strong and does not give excessive attention, causing women to chase him and value his presence [00:14:25].

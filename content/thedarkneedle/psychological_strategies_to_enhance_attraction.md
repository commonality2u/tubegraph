This article explores brutally honest truths and psychological strategies to gain an advantage in [[Psychology of attracting women | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## Emotion vs. Logic in Attraction

A fundamental principle in human behavior, often seen in sales, is that "people buy with emotion and justify with logic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This psychological rule applies broadly, including in [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | relationships]], especially with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

Consider the example of buying an expensive car:
*   A person might buy a beautiful, expensive car even if they aren't financially well off because they love it and want to enjoy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.
*   After the purchase, they justify it logically by saying things like, "This car won't break down quickly; it's fast; it's reliable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.
*   These logical explanations are not the real reason; they are used to convince themselves the purchase made sense, while the subconscious reason was emotional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

Women are often the biggest consumers because they are generally more emotional beings than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>. This emotional nature directly translates to [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] and relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:08">[01:00:08]</a>.

### Emotional Decision-Making in Relationships
In [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | relationships]] and [[Psychology of attracting women | attraction]], a woman is 100% an emotional being who makes all decisions based on emotion, then justifies them with logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

For instance:
*   If a girl talks about a guy she likes, she might list logical reasons like him being "nice, handsome, attractive, tall, or having money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. However, these are often just logical explanations; the real reason she's attracted is because he moved her emotionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   Similarly, when a woman breaks up with someone or seeks a divorce, logical reasons like "he didn't care about her," "money," or "bad treatment" are often given <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. The true underlying reason, however, is almost always that the [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] died <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. If [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] persists, she would remain attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>.

### The Power of Attraction
Every relationship contains both good and bad aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   When [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] is high, a woman automatically focuses on the positive aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.
*   When [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] is low, she starts noticing only the negative things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.
*   Even if a man cheats, is an alcoholic, or causes pain, high [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] can lead her to forgive and justify her forgiveness by highlighting his good traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.

Therefore, when interacting with a woman, you should discard logical attempts to impress her (e.g., being rich or working out) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

## Attract Emotionally & Let Her Chase the Logic

The rule for enhancing [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] is to attract her emotionally and then allow her to chase the logic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

### 1. Attract Emotionally
Emotional [[Psychology of attracting women | attraction]] involves stirring her feelings. Two effective tools are:

*   **Curiosity Phrases:** Statements that spark curiosity and self-awareness, or stir emotional memories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.
    *   Examples: "You seem like the type who..." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:00">[04:04:00]</a> or "Have you ever done something you still feel guilty about?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>
*   **Fake Psychological Analysis:** Playfully analyzing her personality to stir her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.
    *   Examples: "You seem confident, but I bet you overthink at night" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a> or "You're charming, but I feel like you hide how deeply you feel things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:19:00">[04:19:00]</a>.

When you stir her emotions, she will feel drawn to you without realizing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:00">[04:23:00]</a>.

### 2. Let Her Chase the Logic
When she starts to feel emotionally drawn to you, she will try to justify this [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] logically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>.
*   If she asks logical questions like "You're different in some way," "Why do you do that?", or "What's your job?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>, do not explain or justify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   Instead, stay mysterious, change the subject, make her laugh, or give an unrelated answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   The logical justification should happen when she is alone, thinking about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. This process of her thinking and justifying her [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] in her head is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>.

## Women Fall in Love When You're Not Around

One of the most important [[Psychological secrets to influence people | psychological secrets]] is that women fall in love when you are not around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:00">[05:08:00]</a>. Many men make the mistake of fearing loss and feeling the need to constantly communicate or meet to maintain [[Role of Attraction in Relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. However, love and attachment truly develop in your absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

*   The obsession and emotional weight occur *after* you leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. It's not the moment itself, but the absence, silence, and emptiness that make her addicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>.
*   Her mind begins to spin, replaying moments and asking unanswered questions, leading to [[Psychological techniques for forming attachments | attachment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.
*   The brain craves closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. If you provide a strong emotional experience and then disappear without resolution, she will repeatedly replay that moment in her mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This mental repetition creates [[Psychological techniques for forming attachments | attachment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.
*   Her imagination will amplify your presence, editing out flaws and forgotten embarrassing moments, leaving only positive impressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. She falls in love with an idea of you, not necessarily the real you, but the version she constructs in your absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.
*   Feelings are built in silence, distance, and mystery, not through constant texting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. If you are always present, she merely enjoys you. If you vanish when she desires more, she falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

### Practical Application: Maintaining Distance
To foster this absence-driven [[Psychological techniques for forming attachments | attachment]]:
*   After a date or interaction, do not text her much unless she initiates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.
*   Avoid talking to her excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   If she starts calling or wanting to see you constantly, do not answer excessively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. Provide an excuse, like being busy, to prevent her from killing the emotional state of your absence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. Remember, a woman gets attached when you are not with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## The More a Woman Explains Herself, The More Attached She Becomes

This principle states that the more a woman explains herself to you, the more attached she becomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. When she explains herself, she is investing time and effort, which signals to her brain that your opinion and understanding matter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. Her need to be understood becomes a powerful force that builds a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. This process begins when you stop trying to convince her and instead let her talk, explain, and feel more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

Here are five steps to encourage her to explain herself:

### 1. Hold a Frame
Maintain calmness and never chase clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. Let her feel a slight tension or misunderstanding without rushing to fix it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. Your silence forces her to clarify, which is her first step into emotional investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> She says: "I'm not like other girls."
> You smirk and say: "That's what they all say." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>
> She will now feel compelled to prove she's different, explaining herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

### 2. Misinterpret Playfully
Slightly twist what she says in a fun but challenging way to prompt her to defend her identity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Be charming, not insulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> Her: "I don't date that often."
> You: "So you're secretly a heartbreaker who got bored of the game."
> Her: "No, I just haven't found someone worth it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>
> She is now emotionally justifying herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

### 3. Label Her Behavior with a Teasing Judgment
Use confident, tongue-in-cheek accusations that stick in her head and force her to correct the narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:54:00">[09:54:00]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> "You look like trouble." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>
> "You definitely lie to guys when you're bored." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>
> "You're the type that breaks hearts just for fun." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>
> She will automatically respond with "That's not true" or "I'm not like that," thus explaining and defending herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

### 4. Challenge Her Uniqueness
When she reveals something personal or emotional, acknowledge it as interesting but not rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. This prompts her to explain why she is different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> "Oh, you meditate? That's cool. Most girls go through that phase eventually." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>
> "You read that book? I've met three girls obsessed with it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:32:00">[10:32:00]</a>

### 5. Reward Only
Reward her specifically for emotionally opening up, justifying herself, or chasing your approval, rather than for superficial traits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:39:00">[10:39:00]</a>. This reinforces the desired behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

> [!example] Example
> After she defends her choices: "Okay, I'll give you that one. You actually surprised me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>
> Your validation now feels earned and becomes addictive to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:55:00">[10:55:00]</a>.

This process causes her to feel misunderstood, then understood, leading her to desire more of that validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:58:00">[10:58:00]</a>. By making her work for emotional validation, her brain justifies the effort by deeming you important. Once she begins to define herself based on your perception of her, she will not just want your attention, but need it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

## Conclusion

Consider what you should have done and what you shouldn't have done using these three secrets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:18:00">[11:18:00]</a>. This reflection can help you absorb the lessons and apply them naturally in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:32:00">[11:32:00]</a>.

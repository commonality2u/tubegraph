When it comes to attraction and relationships, there are two distinct types of "chasing" that occur between individuals: logical chasing and emotional chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Understanding the differences between these two can illuminate the dynamics of attraction and help foster more meaningful connections.

## Logical Chasing

Logical chasing occurs when a woman pursues a man based on a clear, perceived benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Her interest is rooted in what she can gain from the relationship rather than genuine feelings for the individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

For example, if a man is wealthy and holds a high social status, a woman might think that entering a relationship with him would provide financial benefits, gifts, and a comfortable life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. She would then pursue him because it aligns with her perceived interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

### Problems with Logical Chasing

While logical chasing might seem appealing, it comes with significant drawbacks:
*   **Rarity and Difficulty** Achieving the high status or wealth necessary to consistently attract logical chasing is extremely rare and difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.
*   **Lack of Meaningful Connection** This type of chasing rarely leads to a strong, meaningful, or lasting relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. A woman might appear excited by a man's financial success, but her interest is in the money, not the man himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   **Unfulfilled Emotional Needs** Even if she stays, she will continuously seek someone else who can fulfill her core emotional needs, which money cannot satisfy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
*   **Financial Drain** Relying on logical chasing can lead to a "sugar daddy" dynamic where a woman can quickly drain a man's finances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. If the goal is a woman who loves and chases a man for who he is, logical chasing is not in his best interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

## Emotional Chasing

Emotional chasing occurs when a woman pursues a man because of her genuine feelings and love for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Her actions are driven by attraction and affection, often feeling beyond her control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. She becomes willing to do anything for him and struggles with being away from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

This type of chasing is crucial for fostering love, enjoyment, and longevity in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A "golden rule" of relationships states that a woman will never truly love or develop deep feelings for a man unless this [[transitioning_to_the_chasing_phase|emotional chasing]] takes place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Facilitating Emotional Chasing: The Hunting and Chasing Stages

Emotional chasing is not accidental; it is cultivated through a dynamic process involving two main stages: the hunting stage and the chasing stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

The overall dynamic involves a man initially providing a small amount of attention, then pulling back, only to return later with more attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Over time, the woman begins to crave this attention and eventually starts seeking it out herself, at which point the dynamic shifts and she "pays the price" (subconsciously, for women, this "currency" is often sex) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### The Hunting Phase

In the hunting phase, the man takes the initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>. His role in the dating market is to be the "chooser," selecting the girl he wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. This means he initiates conversations, takes the first step, and asks her out on dates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

#### Being a Hunter, Not a Follower

Even while taking initiative, it's crucial not to chase in a desperate way. A hunter leads; a follower asks permission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. This is conveyed through subtle signals in how questions are phrased:

*   **Follower Questions:** "When can I see you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>, "What do you like to do for fun?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, "Can I get your number?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a> These questions put the ball in her court, asking her to take charge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
*   **Hunter Statements:** "Tell me when you're free this week. I want to take you to the best spot ever, you'll love it. Meet me there at 7:00, wear something nice." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, "Message me, I've got a fun idea." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>, "Put your number in my phone, let's stay in touch." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a> These are direct statements of intent, showing confidence and leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

A woman desires a man who knows what to do and simply does it, feeling more comfortable following someone confident in leading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

#### Handling Rejection and Communication in the Hunting Phase

*   **Suggesting another day:** If a girl declines a date with an excuse, do not immediately suggest an alternative day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Instead, respond with "All right, no problem, let's leave it for another time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **Post-Date Communication:** After a date, do not immediately send messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Take a step back for a week, then send a message suggesting another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Initiation Frequency:** Initiate contact only once a week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. If she messages you, it's fine to respond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This approach ensures you're taking initiative without chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

#### Dating During the Hunting Phase

The primary goal during a date is to [[triggering_emotional_responses_during_conversations|jack up the emotional energy of the interaction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.

*   **Punctuality:** Do not wait more than 10 minutes for a late date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Leaving demonstrates that you value your time and have other important things to do, preventing her from taking you for granted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. While some tactics suggest being intentionally late, being on time is generally better as women are increasingly aware of such games <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
*   **Conversation Topics:** Focus on questions that have an [[emphasizing_emotions_over_facts_in_conversations|emotional impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> and [[building_emotional_connections_in_interactions|spark her emotions]], avoiding boring questions like "What do you do for work?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a> Aim to connect on an [[role_of_emotions_vs_logic_in_relationships|emotional level]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> with questions such as:
    *   "Do you remember the last time you did something so exciting that you couldn't stop thinking about it for days?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>
    *   "When was the last time you laughed so hard?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>
    *   "If you were guaranteed not to fail, what would you want to become?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>
    *   "Who is the person you care about the most in your life?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>
    The key is to [[triggering_emotional_responses_during_conversations|triggering emotional responses during conversations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Kiss Test:** When the conversation reaches a high level of [[emotional_decision_making_in_relationships|emotional involvement]], a kiss test can be performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. An emotionally charged girl is less likely to refuse a kiss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Ending the Date:** End the date at its peak, when the conversation is exciting and both are having a great time, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Leave without promising another date to maintain mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

Continue this pattern of meeting once a week and giving her space, allowing her to think about you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

### The Chasing Phase

The transition to the chasing phase occurs when the girl begins messaging, calling, and wanting to meet daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. This indicates she has developed feelings and is starting to like you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

In this phase, it's crucial not to be constantly available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. If she calls, don't always answer; if she asks to meet, sometimes say you're busy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. Becoming too available too quickly can lead to her getting bored and her feelings cooling off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. To maintain a long-lasting and enjoyable relationship, she needs to chase you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

This distancing should only happen once she is clearly attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. If done too early, before she develops feelings, she will lose interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

This dynamic of providing a challenge and not always being available is not manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. It caters to a woman's natural desire for "drama" and challenge in a relationship, and for a strong man who challenges her, rather than one who is overly compliant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. The constant presence of challenge is part of the [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction|emotional dynamics to maintain attraction]].

If she distances herself in the chasing phase to test if you'll pursue her, it's important to stay cool and not chase her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Ultimately, the guiding principle remains: be the hunter, not the chaser <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.

To truly connect with someone, especially in the context of attraction, it's essential to [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | speak to their emotions]] rather than just their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This approach is key to moving beyond a platonic "friend" category and into a romantic "boyfriend" category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

The quickest way to [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | speak to emotions]] is by using a technique called "listen like a therapist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This technique involves asking emotional questions and listening to the answers as a therapist would <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

When initially interacting with a woman, her mind quickly categorizes a man into one of three groups: potential boyfriend, friend, or someone she doesn't want to meet again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. If communication is purely logical, it often leads to being categorized as "just a friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The fundamental difference between a boyfriend and a friend is the presence of emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. To be seen as a boyfriend, one must know how to [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | stir a woman's emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### How to Stir Emotions

Emotions can be stirred in two ways: by putting feelings into a person or by drawing them out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Initially, it's difficult to input feelings, but you can effectively draw them out by making her [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | express feelings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. Once she expresses feelings, the door to her emotions is opened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Characteristics of Emotional Questions

An emotional question is one that prompts a woman to [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | express her feelings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. These feelings can include anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, passion, or others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

The second condition for an effective emotional question is that the answer should be long and expressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. If a short answer is given, follow up with "why?" to encourage further expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

### Logical vs. Emotional Communication

Consider the difference between a logical and an emotional conversation:

*   **Logical Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>:
    *   Asking about a job or studies, where answers are factual and "cold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Where do you live?" "New York." "Wow, New York, that's a beautiful city." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a> This type of conversation is easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Emotional Communication** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>:
    *   Asking if someone likes their field of study, and *why* or *why not* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This encourages the person to [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | express feelings]] about their likes and dislikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Where do you live?" "New York." "New York? How can you live in a city like that? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a> It seems like a very noisy city to me. Do you like New York?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a> This line of questioning delves into feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Transforming Questions into Conversations

An emotional question is merely a key to unlock an emotional conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Once a woman begins to [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | express herself]] and share her story, listen carefully and avoid interrupting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. The goal is to get her to [[emotional_communication_in_relationships | express herself]] as much as possible, focusing on allowing her to talk about emotional things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. This way, you are not talking to her mind, but directly to her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

Compare an emotional conversation to a logical one: an emotional conversation will stay in her mind for years because you [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | stirred her emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Avoiding Interview Mode

A common mistake is falling into "interview mode," where one keeps asking questions without allowing for natural conversational flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Questions should be related and complementary to each other, not a rapid-fire interrogation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. In a conversation, the woman should ideally be talking 70% of the time, especially at the beginning, allowing you to listen and absorb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Arthur Aaron's 36 Questions to Fall in Love

Social psychology researcher Arthur Aaron created a list of "36 Questions to Fall in Love" designed to increase intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. In an experiment, pairings of strangers asking each other these questions experienced significant attraction, with some even marrying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The questions aim to reveal personal details related to [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | intimacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The questions are divided into three sets of 12, with intensity gradually increasing within and across sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Examples of Emotional Questions (First 10)

1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what you're going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>

It's crucial to [[understanding_and_recognizing_emotional_states | understand]] the concept behind emotional questions rather than simply memorizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. The secret lies in knowing how to transform a regular conversation into an emotional one based on the specific circumstances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

## Emotional Connection and Desire

For men, sexual desire is often visually triggered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. Women, however, tend to feel sexual desire when they start experiencing emotions, especially if you are the cause of those emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This highlights the power of [[the_importance_of_emotional_connection | emotional connection]].

> [!example] The MBTI Test Story
> A story illustrates this: The speaker was dating a girl who was not comfortable with early sexual intimacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. During a date, instead of pushing for physical intimacy, they took an MBTI personality test together <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. While asking the test questions, the speaker encouraged her to elaborate and tell stories about herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>. Before finishing the test, they ended up having sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. This demonstrates how asking emotional questions can facilitate a deep emotional connection that, for women, can lead to physical desire <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. It also emphasizes the need for creativity, avoiding a robotic or overly structured approach to asking questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

While powerful, this technique should not be used in isolation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>. It must be integrated with other social skills and relationship principles to avoid being pigeonholed into a "therapy zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The principles of asking emotional questions can also be applied to build deep and memorable connections with anyone, not just in romantic contexts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

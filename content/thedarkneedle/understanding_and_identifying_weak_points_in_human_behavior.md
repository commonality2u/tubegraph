This article explores psychological concepts to make individuals admire, like, and even become obsessed with someone by identifying and "triggering" their weak points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. The knowledge provided can be used to become the center of attention in various environments or potentially to [[techniques_to_influence_thoughts_and_actions | manipulate people]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. The user is responsible for how they choose to apply this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## The Concept of Weak Points

To make someone obsessed with you, a specific skill called "triggering weak points" is required <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. Every human being possesses four weak points, and in 99% of people, at least one of these points is significantly stronger than the others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The key is to identify this dominant weak point and use it to your advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Detecting Weak Points in Conversation

Identifying a person's weak point involves two steps: learning to detect it during conversation and understanding what these weak points are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Human behavior typically follows a normal line, but occasionally, a "spike" occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. A spike indicates that a sensitive nerve has been hit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

### Signs of a "Spike"
When conversing, a person's tone of voice, speech speed, attention, and presence are generally normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, a spike is characterized by:
*   A slight change in behavior when a topic grabs their attention or makes them laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.
*   A significant increase in their emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.
*   Repeating a phrase or sentence twice, often when they don't get the desired reaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

If these spikes or repetitions are directly related to the person personally, it signifies a "gap in their defenses" â€“ an internal deficiency they subconsciously want someone to fill <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Types of Weak Points

Once weak points are recognized, it becomes easier to pinpoint a person's void simply by listening to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### 1. Thirst for Validation
While everyone appreciates feeling valued, some individuals develop an excessive need for validation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

*   **Identification**: This person constantly tries to prove they are special and seeks admiration. They may frequently discuss achievements, retell impressive stories, or brag about attracting others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. They also like to feel in control of their social circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
*   **Exploitation**: Give them a sense of control from time to time, such as letting them decide where to eat or drink <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Bait (Indirect Praise)**: Praise must be given intelligently and indirectly to affect their subconscious mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.
    *   **Ineffective Praise**: Direct compliments like "Your style is nice" are useless and can make you seem like you're "sucking up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
    *   **Effective Indirect Praise**:
        *   **Seeking Advice**: Ask for their advice on a problem (real or made-up). When they offer a solution, respond with "Wow, you're absolutely right! I don't know how I didn't think of that before" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This makes them feel intellectually superior and valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.
        *   **Third-Party Validation**: If they mention an achievement (e.g., running 6 miles), stay silent initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. When they ask why you're quiet, say something like, "The other day Henry and I were talking about you and we were debating whether you could run 6 miles without stopping. He told me 6 miles is a really big number" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>. This makes them feel validated, appreciated, and makes them think about the conversation for days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
        *   **Joking Praise**: Joke about something they are proud of. For example, if they are tall, ask "How's the weather up there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. If they got a girl's number, joke, "Dude, how did you even pull that off?" with a laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Caution**: People with a strong thirst for validation are easily manipulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

### 2. Fear of Failure
Individuals with significant, life-changing goals often harbor an internal voice that reminds them of the possibility of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

*   **Identification**: Someone pursuing a highly competitive university, a difficult job, or acceptance into a band <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Exploitation**: Your goal is to make them express their fears of failure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. By being a good listener, they may naturally open up about these fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Filling this "hole" makes you like a drug they depend on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Bait (Emotional Reassurance)**:
    *   **Ineffective Approach**: Most people immediately offer solutions or advice when someone discusses problems, which is incorrect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Advice should only be given when asked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   **Effective Approach**:
        *   **Listen First**: Allow them to express their worries without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
        *   **Provide Hope**: The key principle of reassurance. The best method is to tell stories (real or made-up) of people who were in similar or worse situations but still succeeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
            *   *Example*: If someone fears failing in web development, you could say, "My cousin was in the same position as you, and now he's an engineer at Microsoft. He was just like you and honestly he wasn't even working as hard as you are right now" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. If they respond with exhaustion, you might add, "I get it, my cousin felt the same way. He also didn't understand anything at first, but little by little he got the hang of it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

### 3. Psychological Trauma (Specifically Rejection Trauma in Men)
[[understanding_and_recognizing_emotional_states | Psychological traumas]] are varied, but a common one among young men is the trauma of rejection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Men often internalize rejection, feeling "not enough" or that something is wrong with their appearance, personality, or financial status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

*   **Identification**: A man who has recently been rejected by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>.
*   **Exploitation**: The goal is to indirectly convince him either that the problem lies with the woman or that he is superior to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Avoid direct statements like "You're better than her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   **Indirect Methods**:
    *   **If Single**: Present facts that make it clear the issue was with the woman. For example, "That girl was in a relationship for 6 years, her boyfriend promised to marry her but in the end he married someone else, and now she's depressed and taking anti-depressants" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, or mention that another successful man like "Bob" was also rejected by her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
    *   **If in a Relationship**: Emphasize how much better his current partner is than the one who rejected him (e.g., "The girl you're with now is so much better than the one who rejected you; she has a better personality, she looks better, and so on") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This raises his self-value and helps him realize the rejection was not about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

### 4. Thirst for Sex (for self-protection)
This weak point cannot be exploited by men, but it's crucial for men to understand to protect themselves from manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

*   **Explanation**: Women do not experience this thirst in the same way men do because sex is generally more available to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. A woman can use this desire against a man to manipulate him, making him chase her and do anything for her without fully satisfying his desire, providing just "a small taste" and then withdrawing to continue the chase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.

## The Addiction Effect
When you effectively trigger someone's weak points, it's like giving them a drug <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. As the effect wears off, their brain will crave more, associating that positive feeling with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>. This leads them to subconsciously want to talk to and meet with you again, becoming addicted without understanding why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.

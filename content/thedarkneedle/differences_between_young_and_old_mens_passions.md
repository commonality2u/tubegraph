A key [[traits_that_make_young_men_attractive_to_women | trait that makes young men attractive to women]] is possessing the characteristics of an older man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While many believe attraction to older men stems from logical reasons like wealth, attraction is not logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Just as men are naturally drawn to younger women, women are naturally drawn to older men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. A young man who can emulate the emotional experience a woman would have with an older man will be more attractive than any young or old man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>.

## Passion: A Core Difference

One defining [[traits_that_make_young_men_attractive_to_women | trait]] of older men, not commonly found in younger men, is their obsession with a specific passion or clearly defined hobby <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. This might involve spending an entire day working on a car, tending a garden, or engaging in religious activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### The Young Man's Pursuit

When young, a man typically has a desire to explore and experiment with life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. His "passion" might revolve around acquiring a new car or attracting a beautiful woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This is often more about goals than true passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>; for example, a young man with a YouTube channel might state his goal is fame and money, not the pure enjoyment of content creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Playing video games, watching anime, football, or movies are not considered attractive hobbies because they are based purely on consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### The Older Man's Discovery

As a man matures and understands himself more, he might reach a point where he loses hope in women and life itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. It is then that he often discovers a true passion—something that becomes more important than anything else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

While any passion is attractive, the type of passion an older man possesses can multiply a man's attractiveness tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. The secret lies in a passion that is enjoyed purely for its own sake, without caring about the outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. This is a hobby enjoyed through **creativity and production**, rather than mere consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

Sources of pleasure include:
*   **Consumption:** Enjoying activities like playing video games, watching movies, or eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   **Production and Creativity:** Engaging in activities like programming and creating games, taking care of a garden, cooking, or building a strong physique in the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The passion that attracts women is the second type—one that allows for creation, requires effort and hard work, and yet brings deep enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Examples include hiking, martial arts, painting, pottery, or metalworking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>.

### [[developing_meaningful_passions_and_hobbies | Developing and Showcasing This Passion]]

To make this passion a key to attraction, a man must have a difficult hobby that requires effort to derive enjoyment from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. If a man doesn't currently possess such a hobby, he can either pretend to have one by applying showcasing techniques, or, ideally, develop one, as these activities offer a true sense of enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

There are two primary ways to showcase this passion to a woman:

1.  **Prioritize Your Hobby Over Her** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>:
    *   This means making your hobby non-negotiable, even if it conflicts with plans with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. For example, if you have training at 7:00 p.m., you leave a date to attend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
    *   Even if she tries to convince you to stay or you feel like skipping your workout, you must force yourself to go <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. This demonstrates commitment and self-discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

2.  **[[using_passion_and_enthusiasm_to_enhance_conversations | Talk About Your Passion with Deep Emotion]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>:
    *   When discussing your hobby, don't just state that you enjoy it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Express the emotions you feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Talk about the satisfaction of lifting heavier weights, the love for the pain in your muscles, or the feeling of reaching a mountain peak after an exhausting hike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Speak with passion and strong emotional expression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

By combining these methods, a man can effectively display this attractive [[traits_that_make_young_men_attractive_to_women | trait]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

## Confidence in Decisions

Another [[traits_that_make_young_men_attractive_to_women | trait]] of an older man is complete confidence in his decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Through many experiences, an older man develops convictions and beliefs that are difficult to change, and he makes decisions firmly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

To demonstrate this certainty, a man must "stick to his guns" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Even when faced with a partner who pleads, argues, or debates, a man must hold his ground if he is convinced his decision is the best one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

**Example:**
A man and his girlfriend discussed moving to a new apartment. The girlfriend wanted a slightly better, newer place, believing it would improve their quality of life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The man, however, prioritised financial flexibility and long-term goals, not seeing the need to increase expenses for a minor upgrade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Despite her arguments, he stood his ground <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>. Eventually, she accepted his decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. She later admitted respecting him more for his long-term financial thinking, which strengthened her trust in his rational decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Saying "no" to a woman and standing your ground, even on small matters, can increase your attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## [[dynamics_of_relationship_roles_and_maturity | Avoiding the "Child" Role]]

An essential [[traits_that_make_young_men_attractive_to_women | trait]] of an older man is that a woman will never treat him like her child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. In a relationship, a woman will either treat a man like her child or he will assume a fatherly role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. A man must never allow a woman to treat him like a child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.

To foster [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] and deep affection in women, one key element is "drama" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Drama is what stirs a girl's emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>, making her think about you constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It is considered the key to making any girl fall in love and stay attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Women Are Emotional Beings
Women are primarily emotional beings, driven by feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. The path to making a woman love you involves stirring her emotions in specific ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. There are eight specific feelings that, when experienced with you, lead to the release of love hormones, fostering attachment and happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## You Must Be the Source of Her Emotions
It is crucial that you are the *source* of the emotions a woman feels, not external factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
For example:
*   **External Emotions:** These occur when you and she are in a beautiful place and feel the atmosphere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. These hold no value in building a strong [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | relationship]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Taking her to a movie that moves her emotionally will only make her attracted to the film, not to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Emotions from You:** These arise when you are the direct cause of her feelings, such as telling a story that evokes a certain emotion, or having an argument that makes her sad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Your conversations and interactions should weave in ways to generate these emotions, positioning you as their origin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Key Emotional "Ingredients"

### 1. Excitement
Excitement is created by mixing attention with a touch of indifference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This means sometimes complimenting her, and other times critiquing her in a way that stirs her emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

*   **Wrong Approach:** Simple compliments ("You look beautiful in this dress") or direct criticisms ("This dress doesn't look good on you") do not evoke excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Correct Approach (Mixing Attention & Indifference):**
    *   **Criticism with Interest:** Show interest, then add a hint of indifference. For example: "You look beautiful in this dress, but pink would have been even better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This shows interest without appearing to chase her attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
    *   **Compliment with Indifference:** Reverse the structure to show clear interest while maintaining a slight element of indifference. For example: "If this dress were pink, it would be better, but still it looks great on you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.
*   **The Power of the Last Statement:** People tend to remember the last thing said <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. A phrase like "You're so short but still you're adorable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> creates a dip and then a rise in emotions, which generates [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | excitement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This rise and fall in emotions creates [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | excitement]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
*   **Exceptions:** You can show complete attention when she does something you like (e.g., if you love green and she wears a green shirt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### 2. Enjoyment and Fun
Every time a woman thinks of you, she should associate you with exciting and fun thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

*   **Mindset Shift:**
    *   Avoid trying too hard to make her laugh or entertain her, as this can lead to being "just a friend" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   Focus on enjoying your time yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Be positive, relaxed, and fully present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   Say what amuses *you*, not just what you think will amuse her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
    *   Be spontaneous: say and act how you want, without overthinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.
    *   **Golden Rule:** To make her enjoy being with you, you must enjoy yourself first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Talk About What You Love:**
    *   Your emotions are contagious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. When you talk about things you love, your joy and enthusiasm will be felt by her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   Focus on topics you are passionate and excited about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Turn Negativity into Positivity:**
    *   **Formula:** 1) Notice a flaw, 2) Point it out, 3) Transform it into something positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
    *   Example: "Do you always wear this much makeup...? Don't worry, you still look cute with it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This approach often leads to laughter and enjoyment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.

### 3. Curiosity and Unfinished Conversation
Spark intense interest, then pull back at the peak of excitement to leave her eager for more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

*   **Unfinished Conversation Technique:**
    *   Examples: "Oh, I completely forgot, I was supposed to tell you something really important... I'll tell you later" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, or "I've noticed something fascinating and strange about you. Do you know what it is?... I'll tell you later, now's not the right time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
    *   Another way is an incomplete story: "Do you know there are two habits I hate in women? The first habit is that most women don't say what they mean and don't mean what they say. (Go silent). What's the second habit?... I don't think you're ready to hear it yet. I'll tell you when you're ready" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   Making her wait increases her [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | excitement]], curiosity, and desire, making her think about you and creating strong [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

*   **Leaving a Date Strategically:**
    *   Do not reveal your feelings too early <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
    *   End the date when the conversation is at its peak and you're both having fun, before it becomes boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
    *   Leave without promising another meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. Most men say "let's meet again," which is not the right approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
    *   This maintains mystery: she won't know if you enjoyed the time, making her think about you a lot and wonder why you didn't ask for another date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This confusion keeps her curious about your interest level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

### 4. Mystery and Unpredictability
Maintaining mystery is key to keeping her guessing about your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

*   **Do Not Reveal Feelings Too Early:**
    *   Movies often portray honesty about feelings as attractive, but in real life, telling a girl you love her too early can kill [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.
    *   Uncertainty about your feelings is a primary factor in her [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
    *   Only show you want her if she confesses her love for you, and even then, she should want you more than you want her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Show You're Ready to Walk Away:**
    *   A high-value man prioritizes his principles and is willing to walk away if they are violated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.
    *   This shows you have options and won't compromise your values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.
*   **Don't Give Too Much Information:**
    *   Being mysterious doesn't mean fabricating things, but not giving away too much too soon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
    *   Giving detailed answers (e.g., "I work at XYZ") can signal low value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.
    *   Instead, engage in a "guessing game": "Guess [where I work], and if you get it right, I'll pay for dinner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. If she doesn't guess, it creates an aura of mystery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   More examples: "What are you doing Saturday night?" "Something fun but it's a secret, sorry I can't tell you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. "Have you ever been in a relationship before?" "I don't know you well enough yet, I don't share personal things with strangers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
    *   The level of mystery should gradually decrease over time, but always maintain some degree of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

### 5. Jealousy
Women love feeling in competition with other women and being the "winner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.

*   **If Not Exclusive:** If asked about dating others, admit it: "Yes, there are a few girls I go out with" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. This makes her jealous and pushes her to work harder to keep you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **In Exclusive Relationships:** Occasionally talk to or hang out with female friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. If she expresses jealousy, make it clear she is the one who truly matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. This makes her see you as a prize and increases her attachment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

### 6. Safety
A girl will not enter a physical [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | relationship]] unless she feels comfortable and safe with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>.

*   **Be Authentic:** Your words and actions must align with your true personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. Appearing fake (e.g., faking interest in a topic just to impress her) is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Key Principle:** Be honest with your personality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. This is a powerful way to make her feel safe, sensing you are trustworthy and genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a>.
*   **Creating a Sense of Security:** Watching a horror movie where she gets scared and clings to you, while you remain calm, can create a sense of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

### 7. Challenge and Disagreement
Do not be afraid to engage in debate or disagreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

*   **Signaling Low Value:** Always playing by her rules and agreeing with everything signals that you don't know how to demand respect and fear losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Women Seek Challenge:** Women seek a challenge, and you will not be one if you agree with them on everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Avoid Being Dull:** A guy who agrees with everything and asks boring questions will lead to the girl losing interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Unpredictable Mix
A good mix of all these [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | emotions]] is the perfect recipe for long-term [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. No single emotion should dominate constantly, as this can lead to boredom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. To evoke these [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | emotions]], be unpredictable in everything you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>, keeping the girl guessing about your next move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Always maintain a slight sense of mystery and [[role_of_excitement_and_unpredictability_in_attraction | unpredictability]] in your conversations, behavior, and expressions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

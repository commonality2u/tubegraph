When trying to attract someone, a common pitfall is to lie about having many dating options. This approach is counterproductive and often leads to negative outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Why Men Might Lie About Options

Initially, some men believe that if a woman is attracted to a man with many options, and they don't have those options, then lying is the only way to bridge that gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This can lead to fabricating stories about imaginary past relationships or other women they've been with, solely to give the impression of having many choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This was identified as one of the biggest [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | mistakes]] made in early [[navigating_the_dating_market | dating life]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## The Negative Outcomes of Lying

Lying about having options in [[navigating_the_dating_market | dating]] primarily leads to two undesirable results:

1.  **Exposure and Attraction Killer**: The woman will likely discover the lie easily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Lying is a significant attraction killer because it conveys a desperation for approval, making her feel that you are willing to do anything to gain her acceptance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
2.  **Seeking Approval**: Even if the lie isn't directly discovered, the woman will understand that you are trying to project an image of having many options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This act of trying to convey options implies that you are seeking her approval, which is considered a major [[mistakes_to_avoid_when_attracting_women | mistake]] in [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating | attracting women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

Whether the lie is direct or merely hinted at, attempting to convey that you have many options only worsens the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

> "Whether you lie directly or try to hint that you have many options all you're doing is making the situation worse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>

## What Truly Matters Instead of Lying

[[understanding_womens_attraction_to_men_with_options | Women]] are not primarily concerned with whether you genuinely have a multitude of options in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. What truly matters is *how you [[effective_communication_in_dating | interact]] with them* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. If you treat a woman in a way that *suggests* you have options, she will assume you do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

This is achieved through techniques such as "qualifying," which involves screening or filtering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. By qualifying a woman, you subconsciously communicate that you have many options because only individuals with choices would engage in such a process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This approach makes her feel like you are choosing her over other girls and that she is winning you over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

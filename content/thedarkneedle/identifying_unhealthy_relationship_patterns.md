Navigating the landscape of relationships often involves understanding what constitutes an unhealthy pattern. While commonly discussed "[[red_flags_in_relationships|red flags]]" are prevalent, many traditional notions are considered ineffective in [[understanding_the_dynamics_of_dating|dating]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. It's considered impossible to find a partner who possesses every desired quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Misconceptions About Red Flags

Initially, individuals might attempt to create lists of desired "green flags" and "[[red_flags_in_relationships|red flags]]" to guide their search for a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. However, this approach is deemed unsuccessful, as finding someone who perfectly matches such a detailed list is highly unlikely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

Traditional [[red_flags_in_relationships|red flags]], such as the belief that a woman "shouldn't have male friends," are dismissed as nonsense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Such a perspective suggests a woman who doesn't interact with men, making it difficult for her to engage in any relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## Leadership in Relationships and Desired Change

In any relationship, there's typically a leader and a follower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. It's asserted that the man should be the leader in his relationship with a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This means she should adapt to his preferences, principles, and likes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

The strategy for influencing change in a partner involves three key ideas:
1.  **Tell her what you want:** Share your preferences when she asks or when the topic naturally arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Do not justify or debate your opinion; simply state it as your preference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
2.  **Don't force it on her:** Express your preferences in a cold and indifferent manner, without implying it's a major issue or a condition for the relationship's continuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
3.  **Don't show your need:** Avoid showing that you need her to change for your comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. If she doesn't change after you've expressed your opinion, do not bring it up or give it attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. This implies you don't need the change, which can prompt her to adapt over time, especially as her attachment grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

A crucial rule is to never change your own thoughts or self for a partner <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Doing so can cause you to lose your [[leadership_dynamics_in_relationships|leadership]] position and her attraction to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Real Red Flags to Avoid

These are traits that are generally unchangeable and can lead to suffering in a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>:

### 1. Flirting with Other Men Around You
A woman who flirts with other men in your presence may be seeking attention or trying to make you jealous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Such behavior can lead to a relationship full of drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. It's advised not to show jealousy, as this signals a loss of control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### 2. Still Attached to Her Ex
If a woman is still deeply thinking about or attached to her ex, she carries significant [[emotional_baggage_in_relationships|emotional baggage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. It's suggested to friendly encourage her to give her ex another chance, demonstrating your willingness to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Remaining in a relationship with someone still hung up on an ex can lead to constant drama and negatively affect the current relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

### 3. Energy-Sucking Women
These women are described as dangerous [[red_flags_in_relationships|red flags]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. They often have deep insecurities and an insatiable need for validation, which can never be truly satisfied regardless of how much attention or appreciation you provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. They may use intimacy as a tool to fulfill these emotional needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. These women often suffer from low self-esteem, may offer sex for admiration, and can be "drama queens" who manipulate situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. It's important to understand a woman's personality deeply before committing to a relationship <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

## Understanding When Women Talk About Other Men

When a woman mentions other men in front of you, there are two primary reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>:
1.  **To show she is desired:** If she shares stories about other men finding her attractive or asking her out, she is likely trying to impress you and indicate her desirability, hoping you will ask her out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. This is generally not a negative sign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
2.  **She sees you only as a friend:** If she discusses an ex-partner she still loves, can't get over, or wants back, she is likely trying to "dump her emotions" on you and "friend-zone" you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>. This indicates she is genuinely interested in another man and is carrying heavy [[emotional_baggage_in_relationships|emotional baggage]], signaling it's time to walk away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

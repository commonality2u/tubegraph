Being consistently ignored by women is a significant problem, regardless of one's financial situation or physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This issue isn't fixed by simply focusing on personal improvements like money or working out, as many people with fewer external advantages still attract attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. Even wealth won't solve the problem, as any attention gained would likely be from those looking to exploit financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The core of the problem lies in one's behavior and the way one interacts with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Understanding Neediness: The Killer of Attraction

When you encounter a woman you like and wish to impress, your brain often prompts you to make an "effort" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This effort involves stepping out of your natural self, such as adjusting posture, speaking differently, or trying to appear special <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

The underlying reason for making such efforts is a "need" for something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. In the context of attraction, this translates to "neediness," which is considered the number one killer of attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Neediness isn't expressed verbally; rather, it's something a woman feels when she observes you making an explicit effort to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This perceived neediness is precisely why women start to ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The solution to avoid being ignored is to not be needy, which means stopping the effort to impress, and instead, staying in your natural state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Women are often attracted to men they don't even like because those men are simply being themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

### Why Manipulative Tactics Fail

Relying on manipulative tactics like delayed replies, blocking, or purposefully being late for dates, while occasionally effective, are not genuine solutions. Most of the time, women will notice these tactics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. [[approaching_women_with_authenticity | Authenticity]] and a [[setting_clear_intensions_in_interactions_with_women | clear intent]] not to manipulate are key.

## Strategies for Staying Natural and Detached

To make a woman feel that you don't need her and to stay natural around her, adopt the following behaviors and rules:

### 1. Enjoy Your Time Without Caring About Her Opinion or Society's Standards

Focus entirely on enjoying your time without concern for the outcome or whether the woman approves of you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

*   **Playful Teasing**: Engage in playful, even slightly audacious, actions that you'd comfortably do with a close friend, such as gently tapping her head with a plastic bottle and saying "Sh" playfully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Another example is patting her head and saying "Good girl" when she does a small favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. These actions demonstrate you're being yourself and don't care what she thinks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Ensure your actions are clearly joking and not rude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Embrace Humor in Reactions**: Instead of offering sympathetic or agreeable responses to minor setbacks she shares, laugh playfully. For instance, if she shares a low exam score, playfully call her "stupid" and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. If she says she fell, laugh and ask how she fell, laughing even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
*   **Maintain Personal Habits**: If you have habits like smoking, don't change them to accommodate her unless it's a serious health concern. If she complains about smoke, tell her you'll finish the cigarette and let her move away if she wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### 2. Don't Overextend Yourself with Her

Present yourself authentically without making special efforts to impress.

*   **Casual Dates**: For dates, especially early ones, choose places you'd go with a friend, even free places like parks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This shows you don't need her and you're comfortable in your usual environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   **Familiar Locations**: Opt for a first date location where staff know you (e.g., a cafe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. This subtly conveys that she's joining your existing life, not that you've altered your life for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   **Dress Naturally**: Avoid dressing extravagantly or spending excessive time on your appearance for a date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. Wear something normal, simple, and comfortable, just as you would if meeting a sibling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Accept Flaws**: If she criticizes an ability you lack, don't get angry or try to prove her wrong. Laugh and agree, then move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Be honest about your flaws and don't try to fake abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Don't Chase Standards**: When a woman sets a standard (e.g., "I like guys who go to the gym"), don't agree or try to meet it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Instead, turn it into a joke, like "You've got great taste," or "Yeah, I like guys like that, too," and laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:10:01]</a>. This demonstrates you don't need to conform to her expectations.

### 3. Never Compete Over Her

Avoid situations where you are trying to win a woman's attention or approval against other men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

*   **Avoid Seeking Approval**: Refrain from trying to tell the best joke, appear stronger, or share the most exciting story to impress girls in a group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. This behavior signals insecurity and neediness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Stay Natural in Groups**: Act as if there are no girls present, and simply enjoy the gathering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Elevate Other Men**: Actively appreciate and acknowledge the value of other men. If someone tells a joke, laugh heartily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. If someone shares an impressive story, don't try to one-up them; instead, clap, laugh, and highlight their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Girls notice this [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | and are impressed by a man who doesn't compete]] and displays [[the_importance_of_confidence_when_approaching_women | high confidence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **No Jealousy**: If you see a woman you like with another man, do not inquire about him or seek details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.
*   **Introduce Her to Attractive Friends**: If applicable, introduce her to a friend who might be considered more handsome than you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This demonstrates a high level of [[building_confidence_when_approaching_women | self-confidence]] and a complete lack of jealousy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

### 4. Natural Body Language

Your body language should naturally reflect comfort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>. Don't overthink specific postures or movements, as much of the advice found online is unhelpful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Simply be comfortable; whether that means hands in pockets, on your head, or leaning back, is irrelevant as long as it's a natural position for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>. Walk and move in a way that feels natural and comfortable to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.

By applying these behaviors, a woman will perceive that you don't need her, leading to [[understanding_womens_respect_and_attraction | attraction]] rather than being ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. You won't be ignored because you didn't chase her or put in effort in the first place, thus never giving her the opportunity to ignore you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

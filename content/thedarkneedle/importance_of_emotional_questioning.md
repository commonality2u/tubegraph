Speaking to a person's emotions, rather than their logical mind, is crucial for developing deep connections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This principle is central to the "listen like a therapist" technique, which aims to [[Creating Emotional Attachment Through Conversation | create emotional attachment]] by [[Emphasizing emotions over facts in conversations | engaging a person's feelings]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Why Emotions Matter in Building Connections

When interacting with someone, especially in dating, people are subconsciously categorized into roles like potential boyfriend, friend, or someone to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The key differentiator between a friend and a boyfriend, for example, is emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>. To be seen as a boyfriend, one must know how to [[Triggering emotional responses during conversations | stir a person's emotions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

Feelings can either be "entered into" a person or "brought out of" them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:01">[01:21:01]</a>. While "entering" feelings is not typically the initial approach, making someone express their existing feelings can open the "door to her emotions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## The "Listen Like a Therapist" Technique

This technique involves asking emotional questions and listening attentively to the answers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. The goal is to prompt the other person to express their inner feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

### Distinguishing Emotional from Logical Communication

Consider the difference between:
*   **Logical Communication:** Asking about a job or studies, which often elicits factual, "cold" responses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Such conversations are easily forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Communication:** Asking *why* someone likes or dislikes their field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>, or *how they feel* about living in a certain city <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. This encourages them to share personal feelings like anger, sadness, hatred, admiration, or passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. An emotional conversation can stay in their mind for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.

### Conditions for Effective Emotional Questions
1.  **Elicits Feelings:** The question should make the other person express their feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.
2.  **Prompts a Long, Expressive Answer:** The response should be detailed and allow the person to "pour out her feelings" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. If the answer is short, follow up by asking "why" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>.

### Beyond the Question: Sustaining Emotional Conversation
An emotional question serves as a key to unlock a deeper emotional conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>. Once the person starts talking and expressing themselves, the focus should be on:
*   **Listening Carefully:** Try to get them to express as much as possible, listening without interruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
*   **Transitioning Emotionally:** Continuously transition from one topic to another, always guiding the conversation back to emotional aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. The content of the conversation matters less than immersing their emotions in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Interview Mode":** Do not simply ask question after question <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. Questions should be related and build upon each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Maintaining Speaker Ratio:** In a conversation, especially initially, the other person should talk approximately 70% of the time, and you 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## The [[Impact of emotional conversations | Impact of Emotional Conversations]]

[[Understanding emotional states and responses | Understanding emotional states and responses]] and [[Techniques for emotional engagement | techniques for emotional engagement]] are critical. For men, sexual desire is often triggered visually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. For women, however, sexual desire is linked to experiencing emotions, and if you are the source of those emotions, it can lead to a deeper connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

This concept can be observed in real-world scenarios. For example, engaging in an MBTI personality test, which involves deep personal questions, can lead to expressing feelings and stories, thereby intensifying a connection even beyond initial expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.

## Scientific Backing: Arthur Aaron's 36 Questions

Psychologist Arthur Aaron developed "36 Questions to Fall in Love," a list designed to increase intimacy between strangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. In an experiment, pairs of men and women who didn't know each other asked these questions, leading to significant attraction and even relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

These questions aim to reveal personal details and behaviors related to intimacy, with intensity gradually increasing across three sets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Examples of Emotional Questions (First 10 of Arthur Aaron's List)
1.  Would you like to be famous? In what way? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>
2.  Before making a phone call, do you ever rehearse what youâ€™re going to say? Why? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>
3.  If you could change anything about the way you were raised, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>
4.  What would constitute a perfect day for you? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>
5.  When did you last sing to yourself? To someone else? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>
6.  If you were able to live to the age of 90 and retain either the mind or body of a 30-year-old for the last 60 years of your life, which would you choose? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>
7.  If you could wake up tomorrow having gained one quality or ability, what would it be? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>
8.  Do you have a secret hunch about how you will die? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>
9.  What is your most terrible memory? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:36:00">[07:36:00]</a>
10. For what in your life do you feel most grateful? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>

It's important to understand the concept behind these questions and be able to create them yourself based on circumstances, rather than just memorizing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The secret lies in knowing how to turn a regular conversation into an emotional one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>.

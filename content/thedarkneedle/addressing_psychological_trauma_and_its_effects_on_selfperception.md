[[Psychological manipulation in relationships | Psychological traumas]] are varied <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. One common [[Psychological manipulation in relationships | psychological trauma]] among young men is the experience of rejection by a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Effects of Rejection on Self-Perception
When a man is rejected, he often believes there is something wrong with his appearance, personality, or financial status, leading him to feel "not enough" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. The reasons for rejection may not even be related to his attractiveness but rather to the woman herself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

## Addressing Trauma Related to Rejection
To address this specific trauma, the goal is to convince the man that the problem lies with the woman, or that he is superior to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This must be done indirectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.

### Strategies for Indirect Reassurance
*   **If the man is single**:
    *   Present facts that shift the blame to the woman. For example, mention that the girl was in a long relationship where she was promised marriage but was left for someone else, leading her to depression and anti-depressants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Another approach is to state that another successful man (known for his success with women) also tried talking to her and was rejected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **If the man is in a relationship**:
    *   Highlight the superiority of his current partner compared to the woman who rejected him, focusing on aspects like her personality or looks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.

By employing these indirect methods, the man's sense of value can increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>, leading him to understand that the rejection was not about him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a> and that the [[Psychological manipulation in relationships | psychological trauma]] is meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

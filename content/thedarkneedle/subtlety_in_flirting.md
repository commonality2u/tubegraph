[[effective_communication_in_dating | Effective communication in dating]] and [[types_of_men_and_their_flirting_styles | flirting styles]] often involve a level of subtlety, as directness can be detrimental to [[creating_psychological_intrigue_in_relationships | intrigue]] and attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

## Why Direct Flirting is Problematic
A common [[mistakes_in_flirting | mistake in flirting]] is being too obvious <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>. This approach can kill mystery and excitement, making the interaction less intriguing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>.

Direct flirting can lead to several issues:
*   **Kills Intrigue** Being overly direct eliminates the excitement that intrigue provides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:30">[02:26:30]</a>.
*   **Appears Desperate** A blunt, clumsy, and overly direct approach can make a man seem desperate, as if he would fall for anyone who gives him attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:44">[05:08:44]</a>.
*   **Unattractive Trait** Complimenting women based on their physical looks can suggest a lack of experience with attractive women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>.
*   **Removes Plausible Deniability** Direct sexual intentions can trigger a woman's "anti-slut defense," as women are often socialized to fear being perceived as promiscuous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:59">[02:44:59]</a>. This can cause them to make excuses or disengage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:18">[03:02:18]</a>.

### Example of Awkward, Obvious Flirting
> Girl: "I love sports bras." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>
> Guy: "I bet you'd look amazing in a sports bra." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:44">[02:07:44]</a>

## The Power of Subtlety
Great flirting is subtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:23">[02:15:23]</a>. It operates through implication rather than explicit statements, fostering greater mystery and [[creating_psychological_intrigue_in_relationships | intrigue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:53">[02:17:53]</a>. This approach leaves women guessing and wanting more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:07">[02:23:07]</a>. By skillfully wrapping intentions in subtlety, a man generates excitement and projects himself as high value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:19">[05:15:19]</a>.

### How to Be Subtle
The solution to overly direct flirting is to be subtle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:39">[04:26:39]</a>. This means taking blunt, clumsy, and direct flirting and making it more indirect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:56">[04:29:56]</a>.

*   **Implication Over Statement**
    *   Instead of directly stating attraction, imply it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. This creates [[using_ambiguity_to_foster_emotional_connection | intrigue]] and signals that the man is not desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:18">[05:02:18]</a>.

    > **Example of Subtle Flirting**
    > Girl: "I love sports bras." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:56">[04:39:56]</a>
    > Guy: "Really? Well, believe it or not, I love girls who love sports bras." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>

*   **Plausible Deniability**
    *   Allow a woman to rationalize a situation as something that "just happened," rather than a deliberate move towards sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:47">[03:12:47]</a>. This helps her avoid feeling "slutty" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:03">[03:34:03]</a>.

    > **Example of Plausible Deniability**
    > A man suggests, "I've got this awesome pool table at my place, we'll go play around." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:57">[03:18:57]</a>
    > This allows the woman to tell herself she is just going to his place for fun, rather than explicitly for sex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:05">[03:25:05]</a>.

*   **Avoid Physical Compliments**
    *   It is generally unwise to compliment women solely on their physical appearance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. This kills any mystery about intentions and can make the man seem inexperienced or desperate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:07">[02:39:07]</a>.

*   **Non-Sexual Banter**
    *   Many men make the [[mistakes_in_flirting | mistake]] of using the same non-sexual banter they use with male friends when attempting to flirt with women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:17">[03:51:17]</a>. This lacks sexual undertones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:09">[03:49:09]</a>. The difference between friendly and sexual flirting is like the difference between a high-five and holding hands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:29">[03:56:29]</a>. Playing it safe and avoiding bold moves prevents the development of sexual tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:07">[04:09:07]</a>.

*   **[[using_boldness_and_cheekiness_in_conversations | Sexual Allusions]]**
    *   Instead of direct statements, use sexual allusions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:49">[09:51:49]</a>. For example, if a woman compliments a man on making a cocktail, he can make eye contact and say, "I'm good at many things," implying more than just bartending skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:48">[09:57:48]</a>. This creates intrigue without being explicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:45">[10:02:45]</a>.

*   **Encourage Her to "Use" You**
    *   Playfully reverse roles by suggesting she is "using" you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. For example, if you do something for her, say, "So you're already using me? I can already see that soon you'll be using me for other things." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:34">[10:11:34]</a> This is a funny and non-offensive way to bring sex into the conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

The overall goal of [[subcommunication_in_attracting_women | subcommunication]] and subtlety in flirting is to influence a woman's mind so she remembers you as a high-value person, not just someone chasing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.

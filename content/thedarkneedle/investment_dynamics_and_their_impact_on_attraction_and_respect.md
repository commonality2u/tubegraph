The study of the psychology of women and [[understanding_attraction_as_a_skill | attraction]] often reveals the phrase: "If a woman doesn't respect you, she'll never love you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. However, the kind of respect required for love and [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] is distinct from ordinary respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. It is not about basic advice like setting boundaries or going to the gym <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Instead, it's about a type of respect that makes a woman desire and love you even more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Two Types of Respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>

1.  **Grandfatherly Respect**: This is the respect one might feel for a kind elderly man or a friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This type of respect often leads to being "stuck in the friend zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Traditional advice, such as setting boundaries, typically only cultivates this kind of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.
2.  **Emperor-like Respect**: This is the respect one might feel for a Roman Emperorâ€”powerful, inspiring, and impressive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Men who command this type of respect are the ones women fantasize about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This is the crucial type of respect a woman should have for you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

Respect, particularly Emperor-like respect, builds gradually over time, not overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. It is a feeling that makes her *want* to respect you, rather than you having to earn it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This attractive respect is composed of two key elements: **Power** and a subtle form of **Fear** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>

Power in a relationship means maintaining your autonomy and not changing for a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

*   **Maintain Your Life**: Your life should remain the same after meeting her. Your friends, hobbies, and interests should stay consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Any changes you make, like quitting smoking, should be for yourself, not because of her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. Women often test men by trying to make them change their style, habits, or even friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Giving in to these requests leads to a loss of power and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.
*   **Don't Change Your Opinion**: Do not alter your opinions to align with hers out of fear of losing her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. If she suggests you change something, calmly say "no" and let your actions speak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **No Sacrifices**: Do not sacrifice your happiness or something you enjoy for a woman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Actions seen in movies, such as giving up hobbies, can lead to the friend zone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. A girl should never be the reason for your change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   **Stop Unnecessary Apologies**: Avoid apologizing without reason or for trivial matters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. If you haven't done anything wrong, do not apologize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
    *   **Situations to consider**:
        *   **You did nothing wrong but she's upset**: Do not apologize; instead, tease or joke with her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
        *   **You made a small mistake (e.g., forgetting a small gift in an established relationship)**: Apologize briefly ("sorry"), then give her space. Do not beg for forgiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
        *   **You made a big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: It's acceptable to go out of your way to apologize, buy gifts, or visit her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Handling Her Mistakes**:
    *   **She made a trivial mistake/said something annoying**: Do not show anger or drama <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
    *   **She made a small mistake (e.g., cancelling a date last minute)**: Hold her accountable without getting angry. For example, tell her she's "messing up her chances" and hang up. If she calls back, demand an apology letter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. She should face consequences for her mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
    *   **She made a big mistake (e.g., cheating)**: End the relationship without anger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. Forgiving such a mistake will cause her to permanently lose respect for you, potentially leading her to exploit you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Never Lose Your Cool**: Do not let her actions make you angry or upset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Reacting indicates she controls you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. Remain calm like "The Rock in the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. Often, her negative actions are tests; failing to remain composed means losing power and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

### Fear (Enjoyable Fear) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

This type of fear is subtle and enjoyable for her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. It stems from the fundamental principle: **Investment equals Attraction, which equals Respect** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

Most men mistakenly believe that their investment in a woman (e.g., expensive dates, luxury cars) will win her over, often leading to the friend zone while she pursues men who put in less effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

The crucial lesson is: **It's not your investment in her that matters; it's her investment in you that counts** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>. The more time, effort, and money *you* spend on her, the more *you* become attached, while her feelings remain unchanged because she isn't investing in you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

To foster [[emotional_dynamics_to_maintain_attraction | attraction]] and desire, you need to reverse this dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. The more she invests in you, the more attracted she will become <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. While some initial investment from you is necessary to make her comfortable investing, she should then take the lead in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

As she begins to invest in you, her **fear of losing you** grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This is a natural human tendency: the more we invest in something, the more we fear losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. Just as one fears losing a piggy bank with $3,000 more than one with $20, a woman's fear of losing you intensifies with her investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. This fear is the second key component of respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

When power and this enjoyable fear combine, no woman will dare to disrespect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

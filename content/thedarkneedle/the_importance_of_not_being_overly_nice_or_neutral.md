Impudence, defined as a lack of modesty or boldness with a slight disregard for others, is presented as a key trait that can make a woman chase a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. While traditionally seen as a negative trait, in the context of attraction, it is highly valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Why Impudence is Attractive

Attraction is instinctive and has no relation to logic or modern-day principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. A woman's primary instinct is to look for a man capable of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. An impudent man is perceived as strong and self-reliant, increasing his perceived chances of survival <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.

In contrast, an "overly nice" man is often seen as a fallback option, only attracting those rejected by the "harsh" and "strong" individual <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>, or those who simply wish to exploit him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. Women are genetically wired to seek an impudent man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Even in modern times, where physical survival is less of a daily concern, these instincts persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

### Avoiding the "Boredom Trance"

Most interactions men have with women are formal and predictable, leading to a "boredom trance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. By acting impudent, a man can break this mold and command a woman's attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This unexpected behavior creates an emotional response and fosters attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.

## Elements of Impudent Communication

Impudence in communication is composed of four main elements:

### 1. Be a Little Cheeky

Being cheeky means adopting a mischievous manner, making her wonder if you really said or did something <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:00">[02:25:00]</a>. This involves showing "too much familiarity too early," acting as if you don't know your place <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

Many men try to be overly careful and formal, which makes them come across as strangers, inhibiting any [[The Importance of Emotional Connection|emotional connection]] or physical attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Neutrality in conversation is a sign of weakness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>; it is better to directly express disagreement than to be neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. People are drawn to those with strong, even "extreme," opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>.

A practical way to be cheeky is to offer unsolicited advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. For example, telling a blonde woman, "You'd look really beautiful with black hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. This shows excessive familiarity and surprises her, prompting her to pay attention and eliciting an emotional response <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This directness helps in [[Avoiding being boring and predictable with women|avoiding being boring and predictable]] in interactions.

### 2. Be Bold

Boldness is an attractive trait to all humans, not just romantically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:00">[05:52:00]</a>. It involves taking risks, whether real or involving potential embarrassment, without overthinking the consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>. The focus should be entirely on the present action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>.

In interactions with women, a man must be bold by taking the first step in everything, from initiating conversation and flirting to making physical moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Bold actions, even simple ones, have a significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. People are drawn to bold individuals because they are unpredictable and avoid repetition, which is boring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>.

Examples of boldness:
*   In a job interview, confidently taking off your jacket and sitting as if the company belongs to you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>.
*   Sitting on chairs in public despite a friend's hesitation about ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.
*   If a girl is talking loudly, looking at her and saying, "Shut your trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>. This is a level of familiarity typically reserved for close friends or a girlfriend, shocking a stranger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.
*   If you catch a girl staring, boldly saying, "I just totally caught you staring at me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. This surprises her and makes her question the normal social rules, triggering attraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

Being bold early in a conversation helps set an emotionally charged and attractive tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. This trait is closely related to [[the_role_of_honesty_and_confidence_in_building_connections|confidence]].

### 3. Be Shameless

Attractive shamelessness involves having the courage to say things as they are and articulating what you are thinking, even if it's "not supposed to be said" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>. It's like a child who simply states an observation everyone else is thinking but too shy to say <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. However, this must be done without being hurtful or socially stupid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.

Examples of attractive shamelessness:
*   Reflecting on something she said earlier and stating your blunt feeling, e.g., "When you said that, I thought, damn, she's aggressive" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.
*   If she mentions a "girls' night," asking, "Does that mean you don't shave your legs?" and escalating to a deeper, even sexual, conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.
*   On a first date, openly laughing and commenting, "I didn't see you. I didn't notice at first that you're short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. This shows you are not ashamed to speak your mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.
*   [[Importance of confrontation and setting boundaries|Confronting]] the "elephant in the room" by addressing something everyone is thinking but nobody is saying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>.
*   Connecting the dots in her story, e.g., if a dating app experience didn't work out, saying, "Ah, so the sex got boring or no sexual attraction, no sexual chemistry" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>.

### 4. Be Slightly Disrespectful

This means treating a woman with the same level of respect you would give your best friends, rather than being overly formal or deferential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. Many men treat women with excessive politeness, similar to how they'd treat an elementary school principal, which prevents any emotional spark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>. This is a common aspect of [[Misconceptions about niceness in relationships|misconceptions about niceness in relationships]]. Over-respect can make a woman believe she is superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.

A way to be slightly disrespectful is to not respond directly to her questions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. Instead of immediately answering, change the topic or share a personal anecdote <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. You can always return to her question later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This shows she is not controlling the conversation and makes the interaction less linear and more unpredictable, fostering attraction and a sense of fun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. It also makes her feel that she needs to "win you over" because you won't automatically submit to her just because she's attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

By applying these principles of impudence—being a little cheeky, bold, shameless, and slightly disrespectful—a man can communicate strength and avoid giving excessive attention, leading women to chase him and value him more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:16:00">[14:16:00]</a>. This approach is linked to the broader [[importance_of_authenticity_and_principles_in_relationships|importance of authenticity and principles in relationships]].

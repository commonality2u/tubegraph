[[Attracting women and the concept of attraction | Attracting women]] is a skill, not an inherent trait [00:00:09]. Your appearance and financial status play a very small [[creating_attraction_through_uncertainty | role in creating attraction]] [00:00:13]. Success in dating is not about lacking personal qualities but rather a lack of knowledge about how to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract a woman]] [00:00:25]. Therefore, personal failures in dating should not be taken personally [00:00:30].

Many social media influencers promote the idea that physical attributes (like height, muscularity, or a beard) or wealth are necessary for [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attracting women]] [00:00:33]. However, the speaker, who was not conventionally good-looking or financially stable early on, found immense success with women once he started researching and studying [[psychology_of_attracting_women | female psychology]] [00:00:45]. Observing couples in everyday life confirms that men with diverse appearances and financial backgrounds successfully [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract beautiful women]] [00:00:59]. This is because the way a woman is [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attracted to a man]] has evolved over hundreds of thousands of years, predating modern societal standards [00:01:11]. The key for men is to understand these ancient factors and how women think to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract them]] effectively [00:01:21].

## Playing in Your Own Field: The "Prize" Dynamic

In the dating market, a woman's currency is often sex, while a man's currency is commitment [00:02:12]. When interacting with a woman, the dynamic of who is the "prize" depends on the goal of the meeting [00:02:25]:
*   If the goal is sex or a one-night stand, the woman is the prize [00:02:41].
*   If the goal is commitment or a long-term relationship, the man is the prize [00:02:47].

As a man, it is generally easier to play in the "commitment field" [00:03:00]. This involves two steps:

### 1. Program Your Subconscious to Not Only Want Sex
This means being sexual, but not "horny" [00:03:16].
*   **Sexual:** Being comfortable with sexuality, seeing it as normal and fun, without shame [00:03:26].
*   **Horny:** Being sexually needy, aggressively seeking sex, having an agenda, and being dependent on a specific outcome [00:03:35].

It is crucial never to appear desperate for sex, as this automatically places you in the "sex field" where the woman perceives herself as the prize, diminishing her interest in continuing the interaction [00:03:47]. A woman will not engage with a man if she feels she is the prize [00:03:57].

### 2. Understand and Internalize That You Are the Prize
Giving attention and approval too easily makes you seem less valuable [00:04:09]. A common mistake is showering an [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attractive woman]] with excessive attention, compliments, and agreement, which leads her to take the man for granted [00:04:16]. Just as a man is not automatically entitled to a woman's body, women are not automatically entitled to a man's attention and approval [00:04:38]. Attention and energy should be given selectively to a woman who reciprocates by investing her own time and energy [00:04:46].

## Avoiding the Friend Zone

The popular movie trope of a "nice guy" becoming friends with a girl and eventually falling in love does not reflect reality [00:05:08]. Once a man is in the friend zone, the woman will almost never see him as a potential romantic partner [00:05:31]. He will be treated like "one of her girlfriends in male form" [00:05:38]. Attempting to make a move from the friend zone will likely cause her to recoil or avoid him [00:05:40].

## The Ineffectiveness of Compliments

Many men mistakenly believe that showering a girl with compliments is the best way to impress her [00:06:09]. However, compliments are largely ineffective and can even make a man seem like he's just looking for sex [00:06:15].
[[Attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | Attractive women]] live in a state of abundance regarding male options [00:06:28]. They are constantly approached and receive compliments from many men daily [00:06:36]. Therefore, simply telling a beautiful woman she is beautiful is not new or impactful information to her [00:07:06]. It often leads her to categorize the complimenter as "just another guy" trying to get with her for superficial reasons [00:07:00].

## The [[Role of emotions and drama in attraction | Emotional]] Nature of Attraction

When communicating with a woman in a dating or relationship context, it is crucial to understand that she does not think with her rational mind but reacts based on her emotions [00:07:38]. Logical arguments or justifications are largely irrelevant [00:07:44]; what matters is how your words make her *feel* emotionally [00:07:47].

For instance, if a woman comments on a man's physique, and he responds with a logical explanation about working out, her [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attraction]] will immediately decrease [00:07:53]. [[Role of attraction in relationships | Attraction]] is an emotional and instinctual response, not a conscious choice made with logic [00:08:13].

### Subcommunication and "Bad Boys"

When a man brags about his achievements to impress a woman, she doesn't focus on his words but on what he is *indirectly communicating* [00:08:24]. What she subconsciously picks up is insecurity and inadequacy, leading him to feel the need to prove his worth [00:08:39].

This explains why women are often strongly [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attracted]] to "bad boys" [00:08:47]. "Nice guys" who shower women with gifts and expensive dates are often ignored because their actions subcommunicate a desire to please or an underlying insecurity [00:08:58].

Conversely, when a "bad boy" acts arrogant, dominant, or unpredictable, he is subconsciously sending messages of:
*   [[The importance of confidence in attraction | Confidence]] [00:09:28]
*   High status [00:09:30]
*   Emotional independence [00:09:30]
*   Not trying too hard to please her [00:09:36]

These signals make him appear as a high-value man, to whom women feel [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attracted]] [00:09:40]. It is not necessary to be a "bad boy" to [[attracting_women_and_the_concept_of_attraction | attract women]]; a man can be respectful and kind while still being highly [[role_of_attraction_in_relationships | attractive]] [00:09:46]. The key is to understand this emotional instinct and female nature [00:09:52].

Understanding women is not complicated; they are emotional beings operating on a set of instinctual rules [00:10:02]. By learning these rules, a man can understand any woman regardless of her personality [00:10:08]. Success in relationships often boils down to changing one's behavior and applying this knowledge [00:10:29].

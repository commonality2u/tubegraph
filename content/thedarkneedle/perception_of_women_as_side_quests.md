The idea of perceiving women as "side quests" is a mindset proposed to make men more irresistible to women, by shifting the focus from making the woman the main character in one's life to seeing oneself as the primary protagonist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

## The Pitfall of Making Her the Main Character

The speaker recounts a personal experience from university where he met a girl studying rehabilitation sciences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. To impress her, he researched her field, learned its terminology, and tried to show his intelligence and education to break the ice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Despite his efforts, he was completely ignored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This outcome, neither dating nor the [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | friend zone]], stemmed from a common mistake: making the girl the main character <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This error is linked to the [[the_dangers_of_seeking_approval_from_women | dangers of seeking approval]] and validation.

### Societal Conditioning

Society often trains individuals from a young age to view women as the ultimate goal or reward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Movies frequently depict the hero's final reward as a woman after saving the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Social media influencers showcase women as a sign of their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This subtle "brainwashing" leads men to believe that women are a reward for hard work, placing them on a high pedestal and preventing men from seeing them as mere "side quests" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This mindset can contribute to [[common_misconceptions_about_attracting_women | common misconceptions about attracting women]].

### Understanding Women's Psychology

To effectively attract women, it's crucial to understand [[understanding_womens_psychology_and_attraction | women's psychology]] rather than just memorizing techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. By understanding how women think, individuals can develop their own effective methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Applying the "Main Character" Mindset

The "I am the main character, she's just a side quest" mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a> involves several practical applications:

### 1. Choosing Conversation Topics

When two people are talking, the one with more perceived value is the one who chooses the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. A common mistake is for men to ask about a girl's interests and then talk about those things to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This approach often leads to the [[impact_of_seeking_approval_and_validation_from_women | friend zone]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Instead, men should talk about something they genuinely enjoy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

*   **Focus on Emotions, Not Just Facts:** The most effective way to connect with a girl is to speak with her about emotions, not just facts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. For example, instead of discussing nutrition and exercise science with a girl at the gym, ask why she works out and why she enjoys training, focusing on the emotions behind it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This demonstrates [[understanding_womens_emotions | understanding women's emotions]] and creates a deeper connection. If a topic is genuinely enjoyed, even if factual, it can be discussed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The key is never to talk about something you don't care about just to impress or get attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

### 2. Not Needing to Prove Anything

When interacting with a girl, constantly remind yourself that you don't need to prove anything to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. This conveys that she is not the most important thing in your life and not the main character in your story <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This principle applies to all people, not just women.

*   **Handling Challenges and Interruptions:**
    *   If she calls you a liar or stupid, agree playfully and laugh, such as saying "Yes, I'm a liar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Treat her as an "NPC" (Non-Player Character) in your life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This approach can be seen as part of [[effectiveness_of_playful_interaction_with_women | playful interaction with women]] and [[handling_tests_from_women_during_flirting | handling tests from women during flirting]].
    *   If she interrupts you when you're speaking, don't try to finish your point or tell her to wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. Let her talk and don't try to return to your original topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. This signals that her opinion isn't paramount to you, which can make her more attached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This falls under [[understanding_and_handling_conversational_tests_from_women | understanding and handling conversational tests from women]].
    *   If a conversation is disrupted, don't return to the previous topic; just forget it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This applies to all interactions, not just with women.
    *   Always have the internal conviction that "Whether people listen to me or not, I'll still be fine" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If a group interrupts you, it means they're not interested in what you were saying, and there's no point in repeating it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. This demonstrates [[understanding_behavior_and_its_impact_on_attention_from_women | understanding behavior and its impact on attention from women]].

### 3. Complete Honesty

Honesty is a powerful tool for a girl to become attached to a man <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. The person in a lower position is often the one who lies, as they may care about the other's opinion, fear them, or need them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Therefore, never lie to a girl; always make her feel your honesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **The Power of Unflattering Truth:** Attractive women often assume men will lie at some point due to their life experiences, and women are generally better at detecting lies than men <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. When a man is genuinely honest, especially in situations that make him look bad, it triggers curiosity and respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   People observe how others behave under pressure to understand their true nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Telling an embarrassing story (e.g., losing a fight) makes honesty more believable because there's no logical reason to lie about something that puts oneself in a bad light <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. This shows honesty even under the pressure of looking bad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
    *   A student demonstrated this by responding "to get girls" when asked why he works out, even with a girl he liked listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This unflattering truth made the girl feel he was genuinely honest and didn't care about her approval, leading her to initiate a long conversation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Embracing Uncomfortable Truths:** To appear honest, learn to say the uncomfortable truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This includes admitting embarrassing moments or giving honest opinions even if they're negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Being honest in situations where it puts you under pressure shows that you are the main character and are extremely confident, unconcerned with her thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

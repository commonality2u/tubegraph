This article explores [[understanding_communication_and_attraction_dynamics | communication and attraction dynamics]] through the lens of causing a woman to seek a man's approval, presented as a key to her heart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This approach is based on understanding inherent female instincts and redirecting a man's own internal pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## The Instinct for Approval

A common observation across women's lives is their focus on appearance, such as spending hours and money on skincare, makeup, and weight loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This behavior is linked to a shared trait: the desire to gain the approval of others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. This trait is considered an instinct deeply rooted in the genes of women <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>. If a man can "feed" this instinct, it is suggested the woman will "become yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. Making a woman strive for your approval is presented as "the key to every girl's heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

It's noted that women do not primarily operate on logic in relationships, as dating is generally governed by emotion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This highlights [[the_role_of_logic_versus_emotion_in_attraction | the role of logic versus emotion in attraction]] within [[psychology_of_attraction_in_relationships | psychology of attraction in relationships]].

## The Man's Mindset

A fundamental rule for men is not to try to impress the girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. One of the most attractive traits in a man to a woman is not being overly concerned with gaining her approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. Modern society is said to have placed a high value on women, which can make men feel they need to earn a woman's approval, leading to subconscious programming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

### Overcoming Internal Pressure

When talking to a beautiful woman, men often feel an internal pressure to impress her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The first step to overcoming this pressure is to acknowledge it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Instead of trying to change the action that this pressure drives (e.g., bragging), the pressure should be redirected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. The mindset shift recommended is to tell oneself: "If I want to impress her, I must not try to impress her" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. This process is said to become automatic over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. By stopping the effort to gain her approval, space is created for her to want to gain yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

## The "Recipe" for Earning Approval

To encourage a woman to seek your approval, a "recipe" with two ingredients is proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>:
1.  **Not giving her immediate validation** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
2.  **At the same time, telling her what you like in a girl's personality and appearance** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Psychological Effect

When a woman doesn't receive immediate validation from a man, her internal instincts activate, prompting her to wonder why <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Coupled with hearing what the man likes, she begins to think, "I have to do what he said he likes" to earn his admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. This leads her to actively try to gain his admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Key Conditions for Application

For this "recipe" to work, several conditions must be met:

### Condition 1: Partial Alignment of Preferences

When stating preferences (e.g., liking girls who wear dresses, or are introverted, or don't wear much makeup), a small portion (approximately 40%) of what you like should already be present in her, but not everything (60% should not be present) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. This prevents appearing intolerable or insincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. The contrast between her receiving validation from other men for typical actions (e.g., wearing a shirt) and *your* withholding validation unless she aligns with your stated preferences (e.g., wearing a dress) is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Condition 2: General Expression of Opinion

Expressed preferences should be general and only reflect your opinion, not demands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For instance, saying "I like girls with short hair" is fine, but do not follow with "you should cut your hair" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. The man should not give the impression that he is telling her what he likes so she can do it to earn his approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. The ability to express oneself effectively is also noted as an essential [[basic_principles_of_attraction | basic principle of attraction]] and a key to charisma <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### Condition 3: Selective Reaction/Validation

Do not react to everything a woman does or says simply because she is attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. If she makes a dull joke, don't laugh <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. While a man might logically worry about embarrassment, the woman should feel "a little uncomfortable" to be attracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. This is an element of [[psychology_behind_laughter_and_attraction | psychology behind laughter and attraction]] in attraction. This conveys that your admiration requires genuinely good qualities in her personality or behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>. Never let her feel that anything she does will impress you; instead, convey that your admiration requires unique and exceptional qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Condition 4: Approaching with Curiosity

When asking questions or getting to know a woman, the approach should stem from curiosity, not admiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. Your body language and tone should reflect that you haven't yet decided whether you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. The internal intention should be pure curiosity, which will then reflect in external behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

It's also crucial not to let a woman interrogate you, as this gives her control of the conversation and makes her judge you, which goes against "natural dynamics" where the man is the "chooser" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Strategies include giving short answers, saying "it's a long story," or redirecting the question back to her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This is a form of [[emotional_framing_techniques_for_attraction | emotional framing techniques for attraction]] and can contribute to [[creating_psychological_intrigue_in_relationships | creating psychological intrigue in relationships]].

### Condition 5: Counteracting Her Attempts to Impress

If a woman begins trying to win your approval by stating positive qualities (e.g., "I practice Taekwondo," "I read books"), your internal pressure to gain her approval might be triggered, especially if you share a common interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. To avoid falling into this trap, either comment casually or, preferably, make it seem like you are bad at the thing she is trying to excel at <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. For example, if she says "I practice Taekwondo," you could respond with "I tried it once and almost broke my leg" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This creates space for her to impress you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

By combining all these points, a strong desire is created in the woman to win your approval, placing her in a state where she actively tries to make you admire her <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. This is presented as leading to her becoming yours and gaining "the key to her heart" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.

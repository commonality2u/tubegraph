Warmth, defined as kindness, gentleness, affection, and love, is a crucial element of [[Elements of Charisma: Presence Warmth and Power | charisma]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. However, true kindness isn't about constantly praising others or doing their bidding just to be liked; that's [[Approaching women with authenticity | hypocrisy]], which people generally dislike because it lacks genuineness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Communication Beyond Words
Humans communicate not just through words, but largely through feelings and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Only 7% of communication relies on words, while 93% depends on body language, feelings, and emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. For example, if you harbor a dislike for someone, even if you speak normally, that negative energy will be felt by the other person, preventing a genuine connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Your inner feelings and emotions significantly influence whether others will want to be around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Cultivating Warmth
To express warmth effectively:

### Assume Good Intentions
When interacting with someone, especially for the first time, assume they are a good person and focus on their positive qualities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. If you already know someone is not a good person, there's no need to try and impress them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. When meeting new people or talking to friends, cultivate an inner feeling of admiration and enthusiasm for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This internal feeling will naturally project outward, [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | touching their heart]] and making them want to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. As humans, feelings are shared; if you are comfortable, they will feel comfortable; if you want to be with them, they will want to be with you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### The Power of Giving
Add value to others' lives by sharing information and advice, but without imposing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. For instance, if a friend mentions they want to rent a house and you know a useful website, share that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. Don't force them to use it, constantly follow up, or demand they check it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>. Simply offer the help; if they ask for more, provide it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. Sharing what you know is a beautiful form of giving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Acceptance, Understanding, and Honesty
Be honest without being disagreeable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. If someone asks if you like football and you don't, say no instead of pretending to like it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Constant agreement makes you seem boring and eventually exposes dishonesty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While being honest, also demonstrate [[understanding_and_recognizing_emotional_states | acceptance]] and understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Don't criticize their preferences (e.g., "football is boring") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. You must accept people as they are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

Be truthful about your opinions: if you didn't like something, say so; if you agreed with something, say so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. When giving praise, ensure it's sincere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. If a friend asks for an opinion on something they wore, you can honestly say, "I didn't like that shirt; it didn't suit you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. This means sharing advice briefly, without insisting or following up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

True kindness involves accepting the other person, being honest, sharing value, sympathizing, and showing affection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

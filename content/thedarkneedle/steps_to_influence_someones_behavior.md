To convince someone to adopt your perspective or to act as you desire, there are two primary steps: first, understanding their inner thoughts, and second, using precise language to sway their thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This approach can also be applied when trying to [[psychological_strategies_to_enhance_attraction | attract or win over women]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Step 1: Getting Inside Their Mind by Building Connection

The quickest way to understand someone's inner thoughts is by establishing a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Creating a connection involves deliberately matching with another person, similar to an "instant bond" feeling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>. It is generally easier to persuade someone with whom you have a connection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

Your brain constantly processes a large amount of unconscious, non-verbal information, such as facial expressions and body language (e.g., how a person sits, walks, and moves) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

### Understanding Non-Verbal Messages

The human body can be considered in three parts—the head, the body, and the feet—each sending non-verbal messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. The idea of connection is rooted in the principle that your body's actions influence your internal feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. You can discern others' feelings by observing their body and facial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

By mirroring their actions, you might begin to experience similar feelings due to the link between your body and your mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

#### Experiment: Body Posture and Mood

To illustrate this, try the following experiment:
*   Walk with your head up, looking at the sky or treetops, and smile, even if the smile is not genuine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   Then, walk with your head down, looking at the ground, slowing your pace, putting your hands in your pockets, and dragging your feet <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Notice the shift in your mood between these two postures, demonstrating that your body's position directly affects your feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

#### [[Adjusting mood and posture to influence others | Adjusting Mood and Posture]]

Since posture affects mood, copying someone else's posture can help you understand and feel what they are feeling, thus entering their mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. To make a connection, it's necessary to [[adjusting_mood_and_posture_to_influence_others | adjust your mood to match theirs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

After observing their posture, define their mood (e.g., bored, happy, sad, curious, enthusiastic, calm, nervous) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

**How to Change Someone's Mood (Practice Exercise):**
1.  **Choose a Person:** Select someone with whom you have no serious connection, like a cashier, neighbor, or someone in an elevator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. This is for practice before applying it to important interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
2.  **Read Their Mood:** Mirror their body language and define their mood (e.g., happy, sad, disoriented, angry) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
3.  **Immerse Yourself:** Use inner dialogue to repeatedly think of the word defining their mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Align your thoughts with the desired mood and recall past memories where you felt that way, focusing on images, feelings, and sounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.
4.  **Approach and Maintain:** Approach the person while maintaining this mood and speak normally, keeping the mood consistent until you are both on the same emotional wavelength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.
5.  **Shift Their Mood:** Once the connection is established (you'll "feel" it), gradually change your own gestures, posture, and smile to shift into the desired mood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Observe as the other person's mood changes along with yours <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This indicates you have influenced them subconsciously using nonverbal communication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Adapting vs. Imitating
> Adapt to others' moves subtly without drawing attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Do not directly copy gestures as if in a mirror, as this is imitation and can cause embarrassment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Step 2: Speaking to Their Awareness by Choosing the Right Words

After establishing a connection, you can influence someone's behavior by carefully choosing and delivering your words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. This involves using [[using_language_and_words_to_persuade_effectively | psychological tactics]] to affect their subconscious, reduce resistance, and increase compliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### [[Using language and words to persuade effectively | Psychological Techniques for Persuasion]]

Here are several [[using_language_and_words_to_persuade_effectively | verbal techniques]] to influence others:

*   **Emphasize the Obvious:** To make someone believe something is obvious, state it as such <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "We both know it's worth it once we go there" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "As you already know, we'll have fun together if we go to that party" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "It's obvious that we have the best offer on the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Questions That Are Not Really Questions:** State what you want someone to agree with and add a question at the end, ensuring your voice tone decreases, not increases, at the end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. An increasing tone invites a negative answer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "You already know everything about that, don't you?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>
    *   *Example:* "It's easy, isn't it?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>
    *   *Example:* "My plane is about to take off; there's no problem if I skip the line, is there?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>
    *   *Caution:* This is useful in everyday life, but not for major decisions like marriage or large sums of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

*   **Get Them to Say Yes:** Use "Let's" followed by what you want to do, as it acts as a disguised order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. "Should we" allows for easier refusal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. The more people say "yes," the more likely they are to continue agreeing, training their minds to comply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. Save your main request for after they've said "yes" multiple times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **"This or That" Options:** Offer two options, both of which are suitable for your goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This removes the option of refusal.
    *   *Example:* "Shall I bring you a cocktail while you wait, or do you prefer a glass of wine?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a> This offers a choice between specific drinks, not between drinking or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

*   **Anticipate the Future:** Tell people how you expect them to react to something, implying that their reaction is a certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "I know you'll be thrilled about this" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Wait until you hear what I'm going to tell you; I know you'll be impressed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

*   **Logical Leaps:** Use "therefore" or "this means that" to connect a true statement with a desired conclusion, even if the connection isn't inherently strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "You're watching this video (true); this means that you like it (desired conclusion)" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "We've been together for 3 months; therefore, I must be serious about this relationship" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

*   **Order and Order:** Give a command you truly want followed by another command that is almost certainly going to be obeyed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. The recipient will focus on the second, easier command but often follow the first one without questioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "It's late and you're tired; take out the garbage and come to bed early" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Come over to my place to have a drink; then tell me everything" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

*   **"I Shouldn't Tell You This, But...":** This phrase builds a sense of loyalty and trust, making others feel special and encouraging them to treat you as a confidant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

*   **Emphasis with "But":** The information that follows the word "but" receives the most attention and emphasis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "You're a nice guy, but you're not my type" (emphasizes "not my type") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "I really like you, but I feel better without a partner at this time" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

*   **The "Ideal" Question:** Using "ideal" or "ideally" prompts people to describe their perfect scenarios rather than just possible ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. Visualizing these perfect images positively affects their mood and provides valuable information for influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Ideally, what is the perfect candidate you're looking for?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a> If you ask this in an interview, you can then align your responses to match their ideal description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

*   **Tell It Without Telling It:** Express your point of view or give orders by stating what you *won't* do or what you *don't* want them to do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "I can't tell you to leave him; the decision must be yours" (implies you want them to leave him) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Don't worry about paying me back what you owe me" (implies you expect payment) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

*   **"Yes Means No" Offer:** Offer to do something you don't actually want to do with a conditional phrase like "if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "I could give you a ride home if you want" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

*   **"It's Not Important, But It Is":** Use this when giving feedback that the other person might not like or want to hear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "Maybe you won't care, but your deodorant is too weak and doesn't last long" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

*   **"I Don't Know If You Realize...":** A polite way to tell someone to listen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.
    *   *Example:* "I don't know if you realize how hard it is for me to work all day and then come home and feed the children" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

Shifting [[building_power_in_relationships | power dynamics]] in interactions, particularly when attracting someone, involves a three-step strategic approach designed to guide the other person into your "emotional frame" and foster a sense of attachment and pursuit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This strategy focuses on subtle [[techniques_to_influence_thoughts_and_actions | techniques to influence thoughts and actions]] rather than direct confrontation or chasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Step 1: Make Her Surrender to Your Emotional Frame – The "You're Trouble" Technique

The first step aims to make the other person surrender to your emotional frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This technique, called "You're Trouble," involves labeling the person in a way that subtly takes away their perceived control in the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

### Understanding the Dynamic
Most individuals approach others, especially in romantic contexts, with a subconscious goal to be liked, often appearing safe or friendly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. This gives the other person, who is accustomed to this dynamic, an advantage, as they expect to control the interaction's emotional tone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>.

### Applying "You're Trouble"
Instead of conforming to expectations, the "You're Trouble" statement "kicks the door down" by putting the person on the defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.

*   **Delivery**: It should be said calmly and confidently, without joking or "puppy eyes," implying you've encountered similar individuals before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Implication**: You are subtly implying they are dangerous or require caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. This immediately shifts the dynamic, making them the one who needs to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.
*   **Psychological Impact**: This [[psychological_manipulation_in_relationships | psychological manipulation]] disarms them by signaling that you see through their usual "game" and are not playing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. It interrupts their social autopilot, forcing them to react to you rather than operating from routine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>.
*   **Open-Endedness**: The phrase is open-ended, leaving the type of "trouble" undefined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. This creates a psychological "itch" as their brain tries to fill in the blanks, making them want to understand your perception of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.
*   **Frame Control**: When they start defending themselves or trying to shape your perception, they've lost control of the frame and are now chasing your approval <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.

### Timing and Application
The phrase should be applied early, within the first 5 to 10 minutes of a conversation, before they settle into a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:54">[02:37:54]</a>.

*   **Triggers**: Use it when they flirt too easily, smile excessively, ask too many questions rapidly, or act innocently in a performative way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:54">[02:43:54]</a>.
*   **Execution**: Look at them calmly, smirk slightly, say "You're trouble. I can already tell," and then remain silent, not laughing, explaining, or softening the statement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>.
*   **Pattern Break**: It can also be used as a pattern break, for instance, when they expect a compliment. Instead of complimenting, say, "Yeah, that confirms it. You're definitely trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:45">[03:02:45]</a>.
*   **Reusing the Phrase**: Later in the conversation, when they exhibit a revealing or unhinged behavior, repeat the phrase calmly. This establishes a pattern, leading them to internalize and even adopt the label themselves, indicating they have surrendered to your emotional frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:54">[04:06:54]</a>.

## Step 2: Keep the Chase Going – The "I like this, whatever this is" Technique

Once the initial chase begins, the second step is to maintain it by creating craving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. This is achieved with the "I like this, whatever this is" technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:00">[04:45:00]</a>.

### Creating Craving
This phrase is used when the other person starts opening up, leaning in, or trying to show their depth or uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>.

*   **Emotional Reward with Ambiguity**: You are emotionally rewarding them for their openness ("I like this") but simultaneously denying them full clarity or definition ("whatever this is") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.
*   **Emotional Tension**: This plants the idea of something special happening without allowing them to fully grasp it, creating emotional tension instead of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This blend of warmth and confusion can lead to obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.
*   **Mental Loop**: Their brain becomes stuck in a loop, questioning the nature of the relationship, which fosters addiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

### Application
The timing of this phrase is crucial; it must be earned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.

*   **Sweet Spot**: Deliver it when emotional tension has built up, feeling undeniably charged but not yet romantic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>.
*   **Delivery**: Say it in a moment of natural intimacy, perhaps after a shared laugh or a vulnerable disclosure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. It should seem as if it "slipped out," conveying honesty without making a big deal of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Purpose**: The goal is not to express your feelings but to evoke feelings in them, then withdraw before they gain emotional closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. This "warm and cold" approach, combined with subtle detachment, makes the line powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: The ambiguity ("I like this" - present, "whatever this is" - undefined) causes their brain to loop, attempting to make sense of the moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>. This uncertainty makes you the sole person who can provide resolution, turning a simple sentence into a "mind virus" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.

## Step 3: Turn Confusion into Ownership – The "You already act like my girl sometimes" Technique

The final phase uses the line, "You already act like my girl sometimes," to transform confusion into a sense of ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>. This phrase assigns the "girlfriend role" subtly, creating tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:00">[08:14:00]</a>.

### Assigning a Role
You are implying they are already behaving like someone emotionally attached, without explicitly giving a title <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.

*   **Exposure**: This reveals behavior they may not have intended to admit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Their mind races, scanning past actions and wondering about the relationship's status, leading to a mild emotional spiral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.
*   **Responses**:
    *   **Pushback**: If they deny it ("No, I don't"), they create internal tension by fighting a truth they intuitively feel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Agreement**: If they agree, even jokingly, they confirm their attachment and step directly into the frame you've provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>.
*   **Subtle Influence**: You are not asking them to be your girlfriend; you are merely observing that they have already slipped into that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>. This prompts them to scan their behavior and potentially intensify their actions (e.g., being more nurturing or consistent) as they believe they are merely following through on who they already are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. You are "installing" the behavior by stating it is already happening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>.

### Application
This line must be used after some form of emotional or "girlfriend-like" behavior from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.

*   **Delivery**: Deliver it like an observation with a calm tone, slight smirk, and playful but not silly demeanor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. It should be dropped subtly, yet land with significant impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Timing**: Use it immediately after they exhibit emotional behavior, not before. For example, if they get annoyed about you not replying, or do something nurturing like folding your shirt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Neediness**: Never say it in a needy way or while trying to convince them to be your girlfriend. It's a tease with an undeniable underlying truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome**: When they start defending, joking, or playing into it, the frame has landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. They begin to think about their role in your life and consider themselves already acting like a couple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>. Once they begin using terms like "we" or "already," they've accepted the label in their mind and are waiting for you to formalize it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>.

By combining these three phrases, you create an emotional loop where the other person doesn't realize they are being led <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. This approach aims to create tension, foster a bond, and give the illusion of choice, leading them to internalize the desired relationship status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>.

This article outlines a three-step plan to influence a partner's perception and emotional state, aiming to build a relationship from its initial stages.

## Step 1: Establish Your Emotional Frame

The first step involves making a person surrender to your emotional frame, primarily through a technique called "You're trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Unlike common approaches where individuals seek approval or try to appear safe and friendly, this method aims to take power away from the other person by labeling them in a specific way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

Most people approach others with the subconscious goal of being liked, which women are accustomed to and use to their advantage to control interactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Saying "You're trouble" (delivered calmly and confidently, not jokingly) immediately puts the other person on the defensive by subtly implying they are dangerous or "chaos" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This shifts the dynamic from you hoping they like you, to them having to prove themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Deep down, people are drawn to those who "see through them" and challenge their usual patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Saying "You're trouble" signals that you recognize their "game" and are not playing it, which disarms them and interrupts their social autopilot, forcing them to react to you instead of operating from routine <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

This phrase is open-ended, not defining what kind of trouble they are, which creates a "psychological itch" in their mind as they try to fill in the blanks and understand your perception of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. When they begin defending themselves or trying to shape your perception, they have lost control of the frame and are now seeking your favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. When someone is focused on how you see them, rather than the reverse, they are within your emotional frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### Application of "You're Trouble"

*   **Timing:** Deliver this phrase within the first 5 to 10 minutes of a conversation, before they settle into a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Situations:** Use it when they flirt too easily, smile like they've done it many times, ask too many questions too fast, or act performatively innocent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **Delivery:** Look at them calmly with a smirk and say, "You're trouble. I can already tell," then remain silent without laughing or explaining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Pattern Break:** Use it when they expect a compliment. For example, if they show a cute photo, say, "Yeah, that confirms it. You're definitely trouble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This breaks their predictable patterns and forces them to adjust in real-time, revealing their true self <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Response:**
    *   If they push back ("No, I'm not"), it indicates your words have pierced the surface, forcing them to [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | invest emotionally]] by defending their image and trying to change your perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
    *   If they play along ("Maybe I am"), you have effectively given them a new identity that will shape their behavior around you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Reusing the Phrase:** Reintroduce the phrase later in the conversation when they say something revealing or you catch a glimpse of their real nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. This reinforces the pattern and can lead them to internalize the label, signaling [[emotional_investment_in_relationships | emotional surrender]] to your frame <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Step 2: Create Craving Through Ambiguity

The second step focuses on [[maintaining_attraction_and_emotional_engagement | keeping the chase going]] by creating craving, using the technique "I like this, whatever this is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This phrase should be dropped once they start opening up, leaning in, or showing depth and uniqueness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This technique rewards them emotionally for their engagement while simultaneously denying them full clarity or definition of the interaction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. It plants the idea of something special happening between you, but then pulls away before they can grasp it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. The "I like this" part shows warmth and emotion, while "whatever this is" refuses to define the relationship, creating emotional tension instead of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. This mix of warmth and confusion creates obsession, prompting them to loop through questions like, "What is this? Does he feel something? Is this going somewhere?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

By giving emotional weight without structure, you make them wonder why you haven't defined it, leading them to feel the need to find out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This puts you in control of their thoughts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

### Application of "I Like This, Whatever This Is"

*   **Timing:** This line must be earned and delivered when emotional tension is built up, but it's not yet romantic, just charged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Situations:** Say it in a moment of natural intimacy, like when you're both laughing, vibing, sitting closer, and they are starting to feel too comfortable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Delivery:**
    *   After a laugh and brief silence, exhale, glance at them, smirk slightly, and casually say, "I like this, whatever this is," then immediately look away or change the topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
    *   After they share something vulnerable, pause, look at them, and say, "You know, I like this, whatever this is," then go quiet and move on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.
*   **Subtlety:** The delivery should make it seem like it just slipped out, as if you were surprised by your own honesty but too composed to make a big deal of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Goal:** Make them feel something, then pull away before they get emotional closure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. The energy should convey "Yeah, I felt something, but I'm not going to make a big deal out of it. It is what it is." This subtle detachment is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Effect:** They will likely not respond directly but will replay the moment in their head, leading to a "mind virus" that causes them to pay closer attention to you and see you two as something undefined yet real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. This uncertainty makes them want resolution, and you become the one who can provide it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.

## Step 3: Shift Perception to Ownership

The final phrase turns confusion into ownership: "You already act like my girl sometimes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. This assigns the girlfriend role partially, creating tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. You are implying that they are already behaving like someone [[creating_emotional_connections_and_attachments | emotionally attached]], even without the title, which exposes something they didn't intend to admit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

This statement leads to a mild emotional spiral as they reflect on their behavior, wondering if they truly act that way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

*   **Pushback:** If they deny it ("No, I don't"), they come across as cold and create internal tension by fighting a truth they know feels right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This [[the_impact_of_stability_and_conflict_on_attachment | emotional imbalance]] is a fight they will lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.
*   **Agreement:** If they agree, even jokingly, they admit to being attached and step directly into the frame you provided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

You are not asking them to be your girlfriend or stating that you want that; you are merely observing that they have already slipped into that role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This causes their brain to scan past behaviors, leading them to think they are already acting like your girl <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. As they play into it by being more nurturing, jealous, or consistent, they believe they are simply following through on their own inclinations, unaware that you influenced their perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. You are "installing the behavior by telling her she's already doing it" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Application of "You Already Act Like My Girl Sometimes"

*   **Timing:** Deliver this line after they display some form of emotional or "girlfriend-like" behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   **Delivery:** Say it as an observation, not seriously. Use a calm delivery with a slight, playful smirk, but not silly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. The statement should land heavily despite being delivered lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.
*   **Examples:**
    *   If they get annoyed at you for not replying, smile, shake your head slowly, and say, "You already act like my girl sometimes," then change the subject <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. This catches them off guard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.
    *   If they do something nurturing or domestic (e.g., fold your shirt, bring food), look at them with amused disbelief and say, "You're aware you're acting like my girl right now," then let them react <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Tone:** Never deliver this in a needy way or while trying to get them to be your girlfriend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. It's a tease with an undeniable underlying truth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Once they defend, joke, or play into it, the frame has landed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** They start thinking about their role in your life and begin to use terms like "we" or "already," indicating they've accepted the label in their mind and are waiting for you to match it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>. You didn't chase them; you led them there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

In summary, the first phrase creates tension, the second builds a bond, and the third gives the illusion of choice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. By creating an [[psychological_manipulation_in_relationships | emotional loop]] they unknowingly step into, by the time they realize they are "caught," they are already self-identifying as "yours" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

The [[2030_agenda_and_its_economic_implications | 2030 Agenda]] is described as a new economic scenario and potentially the "biggest economic and social reform in decades" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It is anticipated to have serious implications for personal savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, affecting everyone equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The plan is already underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a> and its initial consequences are beginning to be experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Origins and Supporters

The [[2030_agenda_and_its_economic_implications | 2030 Agenda]] has the support of influential figures such as Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, the majority of presidents of state, and the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. It has also mutated under different names like "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

This new economic plan originated from the Davos Forum, also known as the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This forum convenes some of the world's most powerful individuals, including Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, state presidents, and global businessmen, to debate economic policies that are later implemented at a local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

The [[2030_agenda_and_its_economic_implications | 2030 Agenda]] was designed in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Klaus Schwab leads the Davos Forum and seeks to modify the economic and social reality for the coming years through these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Ida Auken, a Danish politician, is also behind some of the main economic reforms promoted by this agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Motto and Predictions

The motto of this global campaign is: "You will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. This concept is reiterated by Ida Auken, who summarized the economic part of this new global agenda by saying: "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The World Economic Forum published a promotional video titled "Eight predictions for the world in the year 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Key Predictions:

*   **Prediction 2: Decline of US Power**
    The United States will no longer be the world's leading power, with a small number of countries replacing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Ray Dalio has warned of this risk in his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. In this scenario, the US dollar would cease to be the most important currency globally, and the US would face a decline due to debt accumulation and rising political populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The dollar's market share has already dropped from 70% to 60%, being replaced by other currencies, particularly the Chinese Yuan and other Asian currencies, which are areas of current growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>.
*   **Prediction 1: Ownership to Rental Model**
    "You will own nothing and you will be happy. You will be able to rent anything you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This indicates a significant economic shift from owning to renting or long-term leasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This change is proving "tremendously beneficial for a small number of companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>, encouraging greater consumption and higher business profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    *   Examples include:
        *   Cars: 70% of vehicles sold in the US are financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
        *   iPhones: Most people rent their iPhones from Apple for a monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
        *   Homes: Most people have a mortgage or pay monthly rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
        *   Movies: Paid through monthly subscriptions like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
    *   BMW, for instance, announced monthly fees for features like heated seats ($15/month), artificial sports sounds ($99/month), and adaptive headlights ($10/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. These initiatives, if approved by political and economic powers, could become the new standard, forcing consumers to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
    *   Such coordinated industry actions, historically considered monopolistic, are now seemingly approved because they align with the objectives of the [[2030_agenda_and_its_economic_implications | 2030 Agenda]] / Great Reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Impact on Inflation

Some policies proposed in this economic plan could be contributing to the current economic crisis and high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>, as affirmed by many experts and economists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Predictions 5 and 6 of the World Economic Forum's outlook for 2030 are particularly concerning and are identified as potential causes of the global inflation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

These predictions aim to protect the environment, a valid objective, but propose a "totally radical" approach by completely eliminating fossil fuels without a clear or strategic energy transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Measures such as establishing price limits on gas or oil are also proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. The current inflation crisis is largely attributed to high prices of fossil fuels like oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. High and rising inflation is considered the most detrimental economic factor for the average class, historically leading to increased poverty and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

A "battle against fossil fuels" has been established over the last seven years, coinciding with the [[2030_agenda_and_its_economic_implications | 2030 Agenda]]'s implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This has led to an energy transition without proper planning, causing high energy prices due to lack of investment in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. Investment in oil exploitation and production has fallen by 60%, from $600 billion annually to less than $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.

Understanding these changes is crucial for protecting savings and investments, or even benefiting from the new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Benefiting from the Rental/Subscription Model

Many listed companies are adopting and benefiting from this new economic model, which encourages greater consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

*   **Microsoft (MSFT)**
    Founded by Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, Microsoft's stock price saw a significant turning point from 2013 onwards, multiplying by over ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. This is attributed to their vision in shifting from selling perpetual licenses for products (e.g., Microsoft Office for $300) to charging a monthly rental fee (e.g., $100 annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While initially seeming cheaper, this model ensures constant payments for a client's entire life, potentially extracting significantly more money over time (e.g., $3,000-$7,000 instead of $300) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. Despite being investigated and fined for monopolistic practices 20 years ago, such business behavior is now approved and encouraged as it aligns with the [[2030_agenda_and_its_economic_implications | 2030 Agenda]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Adobe (ADBE)**
    Listed in the US under the ticker ADBE at $400 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>, Adobe, similar to Microsoft, multiplied its stock market value by over 12 times since changing its economic model in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. Adobe's products like Adobe PDF, Photoshop, and Premiere are highly replicable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. They shifted from selling licenses for around $1,000 (including updates) to charging a smaller monthly license fee of $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. This ensures a constant cash flow for 20-30 years, proving more lucrative over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. Adobe's earnings per share have risen from $1 to $13 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. Its valuation has dropped to 26 times earnings, below its historical average of 36 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
*   **Automotive Sector**
    Financial divisions of car companies like Volkswagen and Renault are often more profitable than the car manufacturing business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.
*   **Technology Sector**
    The technology sector hosts the most companies benefiting from this shift from ownership to rental/subscription models, often with near-monopolistic competitive positions, leading to flourishing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. These companies are not investigated for consumer abuse practices because their methods are approved by political powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Many of these companies saw their valuations drop drastically in the first half of the year due to market fear and the bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

### Benefiting from Energy Transition Realities

Oil and gas companies have been a "star investment" in 2022 due to high prices, while the majority of the market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

*   **Occidental Oil (OXY)**
    Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, began aggressively investing in Occidental Oil (OXY) months before oil prices surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. He has invested over $10 billion in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. Occidental Oil is a leading company in oil extraction and processing in the US (Permian Basin), the Gulf of Mexico, and Oman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. It benefits from low extraction costs and large oil reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>. The company currently trades at six times earnings, below its historical average of ten times earnings, and has a significant program of returning profits to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

It is important to remember that investment decisions, including buying or selling shares, are the individual's responsibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

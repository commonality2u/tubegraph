## Ray Dalio's Market Outlook and Portfolio Adjustments

Ray Dalio, the manager of the world's largest investment fund, is known for accurately predicting the 2008 financial crisis [01:31:00]. He often aligns his fund's actions with his public statements [01:39:00]. His insights are closely watched by the market due to his successful navigation of crises over the past 20-30 years, experiencing minimal losses during downturns and good returns during upturns [01:52:00].

### Warnings and Economic Predictions
Dalio has launched a new warning, suggesting that the future could change significantly [00:05:00]. He introduced the concept of a "new world order," highlighting:
*   **Political Polarization**: Tremendous political polarization in the United States between Republicans and Democrats, with even a mention of civil war risk [02:21:00].
*   **Global Power Shift**: The center of world power is shifting from the United States to China, potentially causing future friction [02:34:00].
*   **Dollar's Status**: The possibility that the dollar could cease to be the world's reserve currency [02:48:00].
*   **Monetary Policy Changes**: An impending change in policy by the Fed and other central banks away from "easy money" (low interest rates, printing money) due to severe consequences [02:56:00].
*   **Asset Bubbles**: Concerns about "madness" in the crypto world and certain [[analysis_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | technological stocks]] [03:11:00].

Dalio predicts that investors must adapt to a future where central banks will no longer provide free money, periods of high inflation will be common, and financial conditions will be much more difficult [03:26:00]. He anticipates significantly lower market returns, possibly 3-4% annually compared to the historical 8-10%, and with much higher risk [05:04:00]. He has also warned that the world could change "alarmingly" in the next five years due to worsening financial conditions, the new world order, and internal US struggles [05:41:00].

### Portfolio Adjustments
Ray Dalio's portfolio has recently been published, showing a shift to a more defensive position [00:10:00]. He has:
*   **Sold Shares**: Sold 90% of his shares and reduced weight in almost 300 others [07:19:00].
*   **Divested from Riskier Assets**: Sold almost all shares in emerging countries ETFs, as these, along with technology stocks, tend to correct more during volatility due to their perceived risk [07:34:00].
*   **Invested in Defensive Stocks**: His purchases, though smaller in percentage than sales, have been in defensive stocks that theoretically perform better during market corrections [08:00:00]. Examples include Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which have seen minimal decline [08:13:00]. This demonstrates his actions align with his words, emphasizing the importance of observing investors' actual moves rather than just their public statements [08:40:00].

## Market Response and Overvaluation
Recent weeks have seen increased volatility and significant drops in the stock market [04:17:00]. An emergency Fed meeting and statements from Fed members indicate potential interest rate hikes, with expectations of 1% rates in the U.S. by July, implying four rate hikes from current zero levels [03:45:00]. This has caused the market to re-evaluate, especially after higher-than-expected inflation data [04:40:00].

Ray Dalio's right-hand man, James, suggests that the "Fed's put" (Federal Reserve intervention to support the market) won't occur until the S&P 500 falls by 15-20% [06:11:00]. This implies the Fed views a market correction as healthy to adjust overvaluation, particularly in certain sectors [06:32:00]. While the S&P 500 has only dropped 9% from its maximum, the Nasdaq and small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 have corrected close to 20% [06:43:00].

### Impact on Overvalued Stocks
Many popular companies, particularly those in the technology and growth sectors, have experienced severe drops, often 50% to 80% from their highs [09:23:00]. This correction is largely attributed to the shift in monetary policy and the "new dose of reality" from central banks [09:39:00]. Examples include:
*   SoFi: -61% [11:02:00]
*   Block (formerly Square): -60% [11:07:00]
*   Peloton: Significant correction [14:52:00]
*   Toast [10:00:00]
*   Lightspeed [10:03:00]
*   Snowflake: Trading at 46 times sales [15:03:00]
*   Palantir [15:08:00]
*   Zscaler: Still at 30 times sales after falls [15:31:00]

This highlights the significant risk of holding shares trading at very high multiples in the current economic scenario [10:14:00]. Companies publishing poor results can see drops of 20-30% in a few days [10:38:00].

### Mark Leonard's Valuation Principles
Mark Leonard, CEO of Constellation Software, an admirer of [[analysis_of_warren_buffetts_stock_recommendations | Warren Buffett]], applies a similar value-investing style to the technology sector [12:37:00]. His company, Constellation Software, has multiplied by 100 times in 15 years and has remained stable during crises because it avoids overpaying [12:49:00].

Leonard's key valuation tips for technology companies:
*   Good businesses in the technology sector should **never trade above five times their sales** [13:26:00]. This would imply earnings multiples above 30 or 40 times [13:39:00].
*   He considers multiples **below two times sales** a good deal for good, recurrent, and growing companies [13:48:00].

Many popular tech stocks, even after significant falls, are still trading above these recommended sales multiples [14:06:00]. For instance, Roku is close to less than five times sales, while Snowflake is at 46 times sales [14:33:00].

## Warren Buffett's Portfolio and Investing Philosophy
Recent reports on [[analysis_of_warren_buffetts_stock_recommendations | Warren Buffett]]'s portfolio revealed an investment in Activision Blizzard, which was later acquired by Microsoft [16:11:00]. This led to speculation that Buffett acted on insider information due to his friendship with Bill Gates [16:37:00].

However, this speculation is largely unfounded:
*   **No Investment in Microsoft**: Warren Buffett has stated he never invested in Microsoft due to his close friendship with Bill Gates, specifically to avoid misunderstandings, despite Microsoft's tremendous growth since their friendship began [19:26:00].
*   **Sub-Manager Decisions**: Buffett himself typically handles large investments (over $5 billion), while operations under $2.5 billion are managed by his sub-managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs [20:24:00].
*   **Prior Holding**: Berkshire Hathaway had owned Activision in the past [20:43:00].
*   **Circle of Competence**: Understanding a business (like Activision's franchise model, similar to Hasbro or Mattel) does not require personal use of the product [20:55:00].
*   **Bill Gates's Role**: Bill Gates is no longer on Microsoft's board of directors or Berkshire Hathaway's board, acting as a mere external shareholder [21:52:00].

This situation underscores the importance of **independent thinking** in [[stock_market_investing_strategies | investing]] and verifying facts rather than succumbing to conspiracy theories [22:36:00].

### Berkshire Hathaway's Recent Moves
In the last quarter, Warren Buffett did not make significant new investments himself, but increased positions in existing holdings like Chevron [18:33:00]. His sub-managers, however, made notable transactions, such as Ted Weschler's impressive 10x return on Open Dealer stock [18:49:00]. Buffett has also been reducing his investment in some pharmaceutical companies that were penalized by the market [19:08:00].

## Michael Burry's New Investments
Michael Burry, known for "The Big Short," has recently bought several interesting shares:
*   **Bristol Myers**: A biotechnology company trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) multiple of 10 times, below the market average [25:11:00].
*   **General Dynamics**: Manufactures specialized military equipment like nuclear submarines, facing virtually no competition [25:31:00]. This company benefits from a high competitive advantage, and its demand is non-cyclical, relying on defense budgets which are increasing globally [25:54:00]. It is considered a defensive stock that tends to perform well when the broader market falls [27:20:00]. The company does not grow much but consistently increases revenue and earnings per share through share buybacks and margin expansion [27:44:00]. Burry bought it at around 15 times earnings [28:05:00].
*   **Fidelity National Financial (FNF)**: The market leader in mortgage title insurance in the U.S. [28:40:00]. This is a lucrative niche because almost everyone buying a home purchases this insurance to cover potential hidden debts or building permit issues [29:32:00]. With recovering home sales, the company is performing well [30:01:00]. Its valuation is at historic lows, trading at only 8 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 14-15 times [30:05:00].

## Bill Miller's Portfolio Additions
Bill Miller, a legendary investor who once beat the S&P 500 for 20 consecutive years (and is a character in "The Big Short") [30:47:00], has made significant profits from early investments in Bitcoin and Amazon [31:28:00].

Miller has added positions to **XC Technology** [32:10:00]. This company has suffered on the stock market due to an initial high valuation and business deterioration [32:13:00]. It has fallen from $86 to $12-15 during the confinement period [32:40:00]. Currently, it trades at a more reasonable valuation, around 8 times earnings, compared to rivals at 18 times [33:31:00]. For this investment to succeed, Miller likely anticipates that the market will regain confidence in the business, expecting it to stabilize or grow slightly, which is often enough for such low-multiple stocks to perform well [33:10:00].

## Hyper-Concentrated Portfolio Fund
This fund, though lesser-known, manages $3 billion with a hyper-concentrated portfolio of only eight stocks [34:18:00]. All holdings are described as "exceptionally good businesses" with "huge competitive advantages" [34:25:00]. Key holdings include Google, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, Facebook, and Moody's [34:33:00].

The fund recently increased its positions in **Visa and Mastercard** [35:12:00]. This move capitalized on market fears related to alliances with Amazon and "buy now, pay later" companies, which proved to be temporary [35:17:00]. Visa and Mastercard operate as an unregulated oligopoly and have shown spectacular results, with profits growing over 40% and strong guidance for 15-19% profit growth (20-23% earnings per share growth) for the next 3-4 years [36:01:00]. Despite past high valuations (45x earnings with low interest rates), the recent drop has brought them to historical averages of around 31 times earnings [37:34:00].

## True Value Fund's Strategy and Current Holdings
The True Value fund focuses on [[stock_market_investing_strategies | investing]] in companies with a clear intrinsic value, aiming to buy them below that value and expecting the value to increase over time [44:17:00]. The fund advises against merely copying fund holdings, emphasizing independent thinking and the benefit of managing smaller amounts of money [40:17:00].

### Current Holdings Analysis
*   **Humana**: Published very good results, exceeding market expectations and showing continued growth [44:30:00]. The company increased its profit expectations for the future, including a new 2024 guidance of 20% growth [45:29:00]. Humana has a very low market share (below 2%) and is introducing new lucrative products like loans, indicating high growth potential [46:59:00]. It trades at 7-8 times future earnings, significantly below its historical average [47:11:00]. The company's CEO confirmed share buybacks, reinforcing their belief that the stock is trading below its intrinsic value [47:52:00].
*   **MT Group**: Considered a very defensive business with good growth prospects, trading at a reasonable valuation of 9-10 times earnings [50:20:00]. Despite two complicated years due to the pandemic's impact on the restaurant sector (especially in Canada), the company is now generating the same EBITDA as pre-crisis 2019 [50:39:00]. The company's management has confirmed normalizing acquisition environments, expecting to resume growth [53:35:00].
*   **Facebook (Meta Platforms)**: The fund reduced its position before the significant drop, but now it trades at attractive multiples (around 13-14 times earnings, excluding cash) [56:26:00]. This is a historically low valuation, even lower than during the 2018 downturn [56:45:00]. The online advertising industry is still expected to grow, but the market is currently focusing on negative news [58:51:00].
*   **Google (Alphabet)**: Published strong results, beating expectations and showing good growth prospects [01:13:08]. Despite the good news, the stock has fallen in the bear market, offering a cheaper entry point than before the results were known [01:13:19].
*   **CTS**: A top holding in small caps, it also published good results despite overall market declines [01:13:47].
*   **Swedish Real Estate Company (e.g., K-Fastigheter, Cibus Nordic Real Estate)**: The fund holds a position in a "Nordic king" real estate company, which benefits from the strong Nordic economy and legal security [01:14:10]. The company recently issued a bond with a negative interest rate, essentially being paid to borrow money [01:15:34]. Despite good profit growth, the shares have fallen due to concerns about rising interest rates affecting real estate valuations [01:16:37]. However, rising rates also signal inflation, and real estate is a strong inflation hedge [01:18:11]. The company's book value is expected to grow significantly, yet it trades at approximately one times book value, which is historically low for a company with its return on equity [01:25:20].
*   **PayPal**: Has continued to decline after a profit warning, reaching approximately 20 times earnings for a company still growing at 20% [01:41:00]. Analyzing trading volumes during large drops can help optimize entry points, as the initial panic selling often gives way to a bleeding process that eventually normalizes [01:31:55].
*   **KnowBe4**: Published good results with strong growth, but its stock still went down due to the bear market environment [01:36:58]. It is trading at 14 times future free cash flow [01:37:30].
*   **Volati**: A similar case to KnowBe4, a company with strong growth (over 40% in operating profits) but its stock has declined [01:37:22]. The founders hold many shares, and it has an interesting management model [01:38:15].
*   **Digital Technology**: A digital services company showing powerful growth and high EBIT margins (15-20%) [01:43:06]. However, its valuation remains demanding compared to its growth rate [01:43:58].

### Market Volatility and Opportunity
The current market volatility, characterized by fear and declining stock prices, is seen as an ideal environment for investors to train and find [[analyzing_stock_opportunities | opportunities]] [01:41:00]. Periods of market decline, while uncomfortable, are where long-term wealth is built by those prepared to act [01:00:17].

The True Value fund increased its investment during recent market declines, viewing it as a good time to buy given that many stocks are trading at valuations seen in 2018 or even lower [01:00:41]. This approach of buying when others are selling is a core principle of successful [[stock_market_investing_strategies | investing]] [01:00:50]. The fund aims to utilize liquidity when prices fall further, and may even sell "safer" shares to capitalize on deeper opportunities [01:02:03].

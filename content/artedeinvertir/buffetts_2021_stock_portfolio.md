Warren Buffett, widely recognized as the greatest investor of all time, holds a portfolio of listed shares valued at over $240 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. After a period of caution involving share sales during a crisis, he has recently regained confidence, making significant purchases, including one acquisition exceeding $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Due to stock market transparency rules, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] is required to periodically declare his stock purchases, sales, and main investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy

One of the most effective ways to generate investment ideas is to observe the actions of successful investors like [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Nicknamed the "Oracle of Omaha" for his ability to foresee market trends, he has grown his initial investment of a thousand dollars into immense wealth, consistently generating annual returns exceeding 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's investment strategy]] typically involves waiting for high-quality companies with predictable and growing income streams to trade at attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This often occurs when companies face temporary, solvable problems or when the market overlooks them in favor of "fashionable" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. A key lesson from his experience is that even an excellent company is not worth investing in at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.

## Transparency and Data Sources

The American regulator, the SEC, mandates large investors like [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] (with over $100 million in investments) to declare their stock purchases, sales, and main holdings quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This information can be obtained directly from the SEC website by searching for Berkshire Hathaway's "document 13 efe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Alternatively, websites like Way Wisdom (waywisdom.com) process this data into a more understandable format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. Information on company financials and valuations can also be found on sites like Carrere.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## Recent Investment Activities

After a period of selling due to the current crisis, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] has re-entered the market with significant purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

### Sales

Recently, he has reduced his investments in American banks such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and PNC Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This suggests a less optimistic outlook on the banking sector for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Purchases

His recent investments have primarily focused on pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol Myers, Merck, and AbbVie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. These new investments align with [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's characteristic investment style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. The pharmaceutical sector, despite historically high valuations, came under pressure after the 2016 US election due to threats of new regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. However, with the new Democratic administration planning significant investments in healthcare, this threat has dissipated, revealing strong businesses with attractive valuations not seen in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. These companies are resistant to economic crises, have doubled profits over the last five years, and show good future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Additionally, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] made a substantial purchase of over $9 billion in shares of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. He explained that he and Charlie Munger believe Berkshire's shares are trading below their real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. By buying back and canceling shares, they aim to increase the percentage of the company owned by the remaining shareholders, thus enhancing value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. Historically, aggressive buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway shares by [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] have coincided with good performance on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Key Holdings in Warren Buffett's 2021 Portfolio

The top six investments represent 80% of [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's]] portfolio, likely dictating its performance for the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

### 1. Apple (AAPL)

*   **Investment**: Over $109 million, representing 47% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.
*   **Price**: $117 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: Apple is considered one of the best businesses listed on the stock market, having multiplied its value over 100 times in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] first invested in Apple in 2016 when the market undervalued it, believing it couldn't grow much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He invested $20 billion at $25 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Since then, the shares have multiplied by 5 times, generating over $80 trillion in profit for him and his shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. The current valuation, while approaching 30 times earnings, is justified for a company of such quality and future growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

### 2. Bank of America (BAC)

*   **Investment**: Over $24 billion, representing more than 10% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   **Price**: $26 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: Bank of America is one of the four major US banks controlling an oligopoly in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Companies that survived the 2008 financial crisis now enjoy higher returns on invested capital and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Despite reducing exposure to other American banks, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] maintains high conviction in Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He finds these stocks attractive compared to other market options, noting that profitable banks earn between 12% and 16% on their tangible book value, which is favorable compared to low-yielding 30-year bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Bank of America shares trade below their historical average at just 12 times earnings, making for an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

### 3. Coca-Cola (KO)

*   **Investment**: Over $19 billion, comprising more than 8% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.
*   **Price**: $52 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: His investment in Coca-Cola mirrors his approach with pharmaceutical companies and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. He invested during a temporary problem (the failed "New Coke" launch), seizing the opportunity to buy a good company with strong long-term prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. Since his initial investment, Coca-Cola shares have multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. His confidence is such that he has publicly stated he will never sell a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Coca-Cola shares trade at 25 times their historical average earnings, a valuation justified for such a high-quality business with growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. These are considered shares for conservative investors due to low debt and crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

### 4. American Express (AXP)

*   **Investment**: Over $15 billion, representing more than 6% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Price**: $110 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: American Express is another quality business characterized by high profit margins, strong return on invested capital, and good future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. It operates in an oligopoly with Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. American Express currently trades at an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. For the next 3-5 years, it is estimated the company could earn over $10 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Historically, it has traded at over 20 times earnings, suggesting a target price above $200 in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This potential appreciation aligns with [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's]] minimum desired average annual return of over 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

### 5. Kraft Heinz (KHC)

*   **Investment**: Over $9 billion, currently representing more than 4% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Price**: $32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: This company, known for its sauces and food products, is one of the few investments in [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's]] portfolio where he has incurred losses, having invested over five years ago at $80 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] has publicly admitted his mistake was paying too high a price relative to the company's earning capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>. Kraft Heinz also faces high debt levels and decreased popularity of its products due to new healthier eating trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. However, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] maintains his position, likely because the company is now trading at a more attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Using the EV/EBITDA ratio (which accounts for debt), Kraft Heinz trades below its historical average of 14 times EBITDA, currently around 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>. With reduced debt and stabilized revenue/profits, it could return to its historical average, suggesting a target value of $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

### 6. Moody's (MCO)

*   **Investment**: Over $7 billion, representing more than 3% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>.
*   **Price**: $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.
*   **Analysis**: Moody's epitomizes [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's]] ideal investment: a company with a dominant market position, resilience to crises, high profit margins, and predictable earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It controls the oligopoly of debt rating agencies alongside Standard & Poor's and Fitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. These companies have the power to raise prices annually due to a lack of competition in their unregulated sector, leading to exceptional stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. Moody's historically trades around 25 times earnings, its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. With earnings per share growing over 15% annually in the last five years, it's estimated Moody's could reach $20 per share by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. At 25 times earnings, this would mean a target price of $500 per share, offering a potential 100% return, or a 15% average annual compound return, aligning with [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's]] investment goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>.

## Other Holdings

The remaining 20% is more diversified across a greater number of stocks, following the same pattern of quality, crisis-resistant companies bought at reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

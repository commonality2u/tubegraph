[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]], known as the Oracle of Omaha, is reportedly preparing for a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He has broken his silence to issue an important warning to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, a message he has rarely issued before <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Historical Warnings and Market Impact
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] has issued similar warnings and taken drastic measures, such as rapidly selling stocks, only twice in 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. On both prior occasions, the market fell over 40%, and the economy suffered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### First Warning (Early Career)
At the beginning of his career as an investment fund manager (partnerships), after 13 successful years with annual returns exceeding 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] declared that the economy faced significant challenges and stock market valuations were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Despite widespread optimism, he accumulated cash and eventually returned all money to his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Shortly thereafter, the stock market fell by 20%, accumulating nearly 50% declines over the next four years, and the economy entered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Second Warning (1999)
Thirty years after his initial warning, in 1999, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] took similar measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. He warned of enormous euphoria in the stock market, unsustainable valuations, and an economic environment with significant challenges ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Once again, optimism was widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Six months after his warning, the internet bubble burst, and major stock markets plummeted by over 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The Nasdaq technology index fell more than 75%, and the US and European economies entered a recession 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## The Third Warning: Current Actions and Rationale
We are now witnessing [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]]'s third warning, 25 years after his second <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. The most worrying aspect is that he is taking drastic measures, rapidly selling stocks to build a cash cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

### Accumulating Cash Reserves
Berkshire Hathaway, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]]'s holding company, currently holds over $300 billion in liquidity, making it the most liquid and cash-rich company on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This amount is so substantial that he could buy 100% of companies like Netflix, Starbucks, McDonald's, or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Selling Key Positions
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] has been reducing his exposure to the financial and banking sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>, notably selling historic companies like Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. These sectors are highly sensitive to a potential economic recession, confirming his cautious view of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He has also significantly reduced his position in Apple, despite huge profits, and sold off his real estate and industrial sector companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

### Investing in Resilient Sectors
Conversely, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] has expanded positions in the energy sector, which is projected to be one of the least affected during an economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. He has purchased shares in energy and oil companies Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Stated Reasons for Caution
In his last conference, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] stated, "Given the current circumstances, I am comfortable increasing my cash and liquidity position. When I look at the alternative of investing in the stock market with everything that is happening in the world, it is not an attractive option for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
He subtly refers to two problems:
1.  **Global issues:** Current tariff problems, conflicts between China and the United States, speculation in financial markets, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
2.  **Stock market valuations:** Current valuations of most stocks are very high for the risks involved, making them unattractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He prefers to keep his money in liquidity, earning 5% while waiting for better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

A JP Morgan study supports this view, indicating that the more expensive the starting investment point, the lower the future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Currently, the expected return for the S&P 500 over the next 10 years is very low, possibly below 5% or even 0% per year, due to high valuations ranging between 19 and 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] himself stated in a letter, "Currently, the prices of businesses with good long-term characteristics are sky-high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

## Advice for Small Investors
When asked what he would do as a small investor in the current high-valuation environment, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] responded, "I would probably focus on smaller companies where there's a greater chance of finding a good investment. If I had less than a million dollars today, I would be fully invested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
He recommends investing in lesser-known companies, where it is easier to find undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. While indexing in famous companies has yielded strong results, future performance is expected to be much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. A complementary strategy is to select individual investments for greater long-term appreciation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### Key Investment Principles for Individual Investors
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] made his fortune by selecting investments in lesser-known companies with greater appreciation potential and attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. His four keys to successful stock market investing are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>:
1.  Buying good businesses with growing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
2.  At attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
3.  With good management that treats shareholders well (provides dividends, buys back shares, runs the business well) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
4.  Disciplined valuation: A business is considered expensive or cheap by comparing its profits with its market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

The aggregate stock market usually trades at 16 times earnings, but is currently at 20 times earnings, which [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] considers expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Historically, his best investments rarely involved paying more than 15 times earnings at initiation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

### Opportunities for Private Investors
While [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]]'s investment universe has shrunk due to his immense wealth, limiting him to about 50 companies out of 40,000 listed worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>, opportunities are abundant for private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Small-cap valuations are currently the most undervalued segment of the stock market, trading at just 12 times earnings, a nearly 40% discount compared to larger indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

### Long-Term Vision
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] emphasizes that economic crises are inevitable but should be seen as opportunities to make good investments with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Overview of Current Trends

Consumer confidence in the U.S. has reached historic lows, even falling below levels seen during the [[Historical and current market analysis trends | 2008-2009 crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. This is a significant concern given that consumption accounts for 70% of the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. The prevailing lack of confidence among people is impacting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>, largely due to concerns over inflation and gasoline prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

## Mortgage Market Snapshot

Applications for new mortgages in the U.S. have dropped to a 22-year low, a decline more significant than even during the 2008-2009 period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. The real estate market has seen a halt in home sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>, primarily because the interest rate for the typical 30-year U.S. mortgage has risen to 6.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>, a level not observed for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

## Key Indicators and Their Impact

The University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey, considered highly important, had a notably negative effect on the market upon its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>. These trends, alongside inflation expectations, pose significant risks.

[[Understanding market cycles and economic indicators | Bill Ackman]], a renowned investor, posits that if the Federal Reserve (Fed) acts decisively, it can help stabilize inflation expectations in the public's mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>. Currently, inflation expectations for the next three years have increased significantly, from a historical average of 2.5% to 3.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. While inflation was expected to drop to 3.5% in 2023, the current expectation is now between 4.5% and 5.5%, indicating continued high levels even a year from now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.

Even when excluding the price of used cars, which had a significant impact due to microchip shortages, inflation remains high at 6.6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>, nearing 7% more recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. This puts additional pressure on the Fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. The current economic environment is challenging, with the economy slowing down while inflation is close to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. This forces the Fed to combat inflation, which could accelerate the economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.

### Recommendations for the Fed

In a meeting with Fed officials, Ackman recommended several aggressive actions:
*   Maintain the neutral interest rate significantly higher than 2.75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:52:00">[07:52:00]</a>.
*   Accelerate the contraction of the Fed's balance sheet (reducing the money printed during the crisis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>.
*   Raise [[Rising interest rates and their influence on investments | interest rates]] more aggressively, potentially including multiple 0.5% increases, and even a 0.75% or 1% increase in the next Fed meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:10:00">[08:10:00]</a>.

Ackman believes that if the Fed acts decisively, the market will gain confidence that inflation will not become entrenched, preventing a structural hyperinflationary environment like those seen in Argentina, Venezuela, or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. He argues that decisive action now, even if it leads to a specific recession, instills market confidence in long-term economic prosperity with low inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. This approach aims to address the problem immediately to prevent a larger future crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

## Market Bifurcation and Investment Opportunities

The current market is bifurcated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:19:00">[23:19:00]</a>. The S&P 500's earnings multiple has compressed from over thirty times to 16 times in the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:34:00">[23:34:00]</a>, similar to previous market downturns, with the exception of 2008 when valuations fell to 10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:49:00">[23:49:00]</a>. A drop to 10 times earnings from current levels could imply an additional 30% fall in the S&P 500, reaching levels of 2800-2500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:58:00">[23:58:00]</a>.

Despite recent falls, the market has seen a "cleanup" of "hot money" or "weak hands," as retail investors who entered during the euphoria have largely exited, returning many popular stocks to their starting points or lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>. Insider purchases, where company executives buy shares because they believe they are cheap or expect future improvement, are currently high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:00">[25:58:00]</a>. This indicates a positive outlook from those closest to the companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:48:00">[26:48:00]</a>.

[[Stock market trends and analysis | Growth stocks]] have become cheaper than value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:45:00">[28:45:00]</a>. Value stocks include cyclical businesses like oil and gas, automobiles, and construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:55:00">[28:55:00]</a>. Growth stocks, like Facebook, Google, and Netflix, have seen their valuations compress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:13:00">[29:13:00]</a>. No investment themes are currently considered overvalued, with some in a fair range and others starting to become cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:59:00">[29:59:00]</a>. While the S&P 500 has corrected about 18% from its maximum, further falls of 25-30% are possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:12:00">[30:12:00]</a>. However, falls exceeding 30% are rare, occurring every 10-15 years on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:19:00">[30:19:00]</a>. Small and medium-sized companies (Russell 2000) have already experienced a 30% fall, indicating potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:31:00">[30:31:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Current Environment

Bill Ackman recommends two main pieces of advice for investors:

### 1. Invest in Predictable Businesses
Focus on businesses that are predictable and can raise prices to combat inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>. These are typically businesses that don't suffer much during economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>. Examples from Ackman's portfolio include Domino's Pizza and Burger King (through Restaurant Brands International) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:06:00">[14:06:00]</a>, as well as Chipotle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>. These fast-food businesses offer low-priced options that consumers can still afford even with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.

Ackman recently sold Netflix, stating that while the business is fundamentally simple, he lost confidence in being able to predict its future given recent events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. His investment style is highly concentrated, typically holding 6-8 positions, which emphasizes the need for high predictability in invested businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:33:00">[15:33:00]</a>.

A study by Long Ten Equity Fund found that "linear" companies (those with predictable growth paths) that have risen over 100% in five years (15% annual return) often have underlying business characteristics conducive to such performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. These predictable paths reduce investor nervousness from volatility and lead to better results, especially for novice investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:40:00">[17:40:00]</a>.

Examples of such linear companies (based on historical performance and predictability):
*   **Mastercard** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:00">[19:14:00]</a>
*   **Progressive** (low-cost insurer, owned by Warren Buffett) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>
*   **SBA Communications** (telecommunications towers, insulated from economic crises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:53:00">[19:53:00]</a>
*   **Microsoft** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:58:00">[19:58:00]</a>
*   **Dollar General** (dollar stores with impulse purchases, resistant to Amazon competition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:15:00">[20:15:00]</a>
*   **Thermo Fisher United Health** (healthcare/life science sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:00">[20:21:00]</a>
*   **S&P Global** and **Moody's** (oligopolies, affected by rising interest rates impacting new debt issuance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:32:00">[20:32:00]</a>
*   **AutoZone** (auto parts retailer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>
*   **Copart** (auto salvage and auction, highly resilient business, grew 20% annually in EPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:56:00">[35:56:00]</a>
*   **Constellation Software** (most linear company over the last five years, almost perfect growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:20:00">[21:20:00]</a>
*   **Waste Connections** (urban waste collection and recycling, super predictable and crisis-resistant) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:40:00">[21:40:00]</a>
*   **Descartes Group** (software for international trade logistics, highly predictable, grew 15% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:47:00">[43:47:00]</a>
*   **Teleperformance** (outsourcing call centers, high reputation, competitive advantages, consistent growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:08:00">[46:08:00]</a>

### 2. Invest in Businesses Not Affected by Rising Interest Rates
This implies avoiding companies with high debt and variable interest rates, as well as highly cyclical businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:58:00">[22:58:00]</a>. While rising interest rates may negatively impact cyclical companies in the short term, Ackman believes they are beneficial in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.

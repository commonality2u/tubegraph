The current geopolitical climate has raised concerns about potential [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | geopolitical tensions]] between [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]] and Taiwan, with analysts drawing parallels to the Russia-Ukraine conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Parallels with the Russia-Ukraine Conflict
[[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]] considers Taiwan its territory, a situation akin to Russia's view of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. There have been significant military tensions around Taiwan in recent months and years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. For instance, Taiwan reported on February 24th that nine Chinese fighters had entered Taiwanese airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. This activity mirrors the high concentration of military forces observed with Russia towards Ukraine in the preceding months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Potential International Response
A potential invasion of Taiwan by [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]] could lead to severe international repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. The Japanese Prime Minister, Mr. Kishida, has indicated that if [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]] were to invade Taiwan, Japan and the United States would not be able to remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Japan has explicitly stated its commitment to intervening in such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If a U.S. ally were to engage in conflict with [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]], other countries would likely be compelled to get involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

The lack of direct military consequences for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine creates a dangerous precedent, potentially emboldening [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]] to act on its territorial claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This situation could become a significant source of friction in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Economic Implications
Fears surrounding [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]]-Taiwan tensions have already influenced [[stock_market_reactions_to_geopolitical_conflicts | stock market reactions]], with companies like Alibaba seeing significant drops due to concerns over delisting shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. The prospect of [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | China]] aligning with Russia and implementing new [[impact_of_the_united_states_and_china_trade_conflict | economic measures]] could pose a major problem for affected businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. Investors must balance these risks against potential opportunities, as good businesses might be undervalued due to temporary fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.

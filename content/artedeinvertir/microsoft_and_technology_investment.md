His portfolio currently represents half of his $110 billion fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Historically, following [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates' portfolio]] has yielded positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Microsoft's Position in Bill Gates' Portfolio
Microsoft holds the number one position in [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | Bill Gates' portfolio]], accounting for a massive 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>. Including his personal holdings, his investment in Microsoft is gigantic, representing over 50% of his assets and an investment exceeding $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]], as the company's founder, is considered one of the people who knows it best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

During 2022, when many technology companies experienced downturns, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] significantly increased his Microsoft holdings, buying shares when the price was between $220 and $230 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. A year later, the stock rose to the $320-$350 range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>.

## Microsoft's Business Lines
Microsoft operates primarily through three business lines:
*   **Hardware** This segment, including products like Xbox and peripherals, is considered the weakest and most volatile, representing a small percentage of total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Office 365 Ecosystem** This includes products like Windows, Word, PowerPoint, and Excel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>. It boasts enormous competitive advantages due to its widespread use and network effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>. The business model has successfully migrated to a subscription-based cloud service, allowing for more consistent revenue and price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:24">[00:44:24]</a>. This segment is expected to grow at 10-15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Cloud (Microsoft Azure) & Artificial Intelligence** This is considered the "jewel in the crown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. This segment is central to Microsoft's future growth, especially with its links to Artificial Intelligence technologies like GPT chat, where Microsoft is a major shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. The cloud and AI segments are projected to grow at a rate of 15-20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>. However, the CEO of Microsoft has acknowledged that while the future forecasts are bullish, widespread adoption will take more than one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:18">[00:45:18]</a>.

## Performance and Growth
Microsoft has demonstrated impressive historical performance, multiplying its value by 4,000 times since its initial trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. Although it experienced a period of stagnant stock price due to high multiples (60 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>, it recovered after its valuation became more reasonable (12 times earnings around 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>.

Recent results show significant growth, with profits increasing by 20% and earnings per share by 2% in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. The company anticipates continued double-digit growth rates in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.

## Valuation
Currently, Microsoft is trading at around 30 times earnings, which is slightly higher than its 5-year average of 27 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>. Historically, it often traded around 25 times earnings, sometimes as low as 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. This higher valuation is attributed to the excitement surrounding [[fourth_industrial_revolution_and_technological_investments | Artificial Intelligence]] and its perception as a safe haven in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.

## Investment Strategy
[[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates' investment strategy]] for Microsoft, and indeed his portfolio as a whole, focuses on:
*   **Market Leaders:** Investing in the best companies in their respective industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Valuation:** Avoiding overpaying for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:41">[00:40:41]</a>.
*   **Growth Plans:** Companies with clear growth trajectories, particularly in terms of double-digit profit growth, even if sales growth is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Predictability and Reliability:** Favoring businesses that are essential and predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>.
*   **Shareholder Returns:** Companies that consistently pay and increase dividends, and engage in share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

While [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] previously sold some Microsoft shares, perhaps when they were overvalued, to finance philanthropic work or diversify assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>, his recent buying activity and sustained large position indicate continued optimism about the company's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:01">[00:49:01]</a>.

This article explores the [[Investment strategies of legendary investors | investment strategies]] and latest portfolio adjustments of Stanley Druckenmiller, one of the most successful investors of all time. It also highlights how individual investors can leverage advanced techniques to achieve significant returns in the stock market.

## Stanley Druckenmiller's Investment Approach

Stanley Druckenmiller, founder of Duquesne Capital, manages a personal fortune exceeding $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He has consistently generated positive returns every year he has operated in the stock market, boasting a 30% annual return for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. His success stems from a combination of studying macroeconomics and interpreting it through his stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Druckenmiller consistently aims to be "one step ahead of the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Preparing for 2025: Key Premises

Druckenmiller is currently repositioning his portfolio for the economic and stock market scenario expected in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His five working premises for the next 12 months and 2025 are:

1.  **Euphoria in Certain Sectors**: He perceives euphoria in specific stock market sectors and is actively selling shares in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
2.  **Fed Rate Cuts**: He anticipates the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates due to a weakening economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
3.  **Dollar Depreciation**: The U.S. dollar is expected to decrease in value due to extensive money printing and fiscal deficit issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
4.  **Persistent Inflation**: Inflation is expected to remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
5.  **Focus on the Future**: The present market situation is less important than anticipating what the world will be like in 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.

### Abandoning Overvalued Sectors

Druckenmiller has significantly reduced his positions in major technology stocks. He has decreased his position in Nvidia by 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, despite being an early investor who multiplied his money six or seven times with the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He believes there is "a lot of euphoria" surrounding Artificial Intelligence companies, which he identifies as a danger in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. He has also reduced his position in another major tech company by 63%, selling over 700,000 shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

Concerns about potential accounting irregularities have surfaced in the AI sector, exemplified by Supermicro's stock dropping 2% due to a delay in publishing annual reports, which can be a "very bad sign" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Druckenmiller notes that stock market bubbles are often characterized by a high number of frauds, where companies distort accounts to meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## The Great Rotation: New Investments

Druckenmiller is applying a strategy he calls the "great rotation," moving away from large, more technological companies towards other sectors that have been "more forgotten by the market" and are currently undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Investment in Japan

He has recently invested in Japan, believing it has high potential due to many cheap stocks and changing policies where more companies are beginning to buy back shares and pay dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Anticipating Dollar Weakness

Druckenmiller states he cannot be bullish on the dollar after more than $8 trillion has been printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. A weakening dollar typically benefits international stocks (e.g., Europe, Japan) and emerging countries (as it eases debt pressure) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. It also helps U.S. industrial companies that export, as repatriated profits in stronger currencies increase their overall profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. Most commodities also have a negative correlation with the dollar's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### Top Four New Investments

Druckenmiller's latest investments are made with his personal money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

#### 1. Kinder Morgan (Oil & Gas Pipelines)

Kinder Morgan is a leading oil and gas pipeline company in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Druckenmiller sees multiple factors benefiting this sector:
*   **Inflation Hedge**: Oil tends to rise with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **Weak Dollar**: Oil prices typically do well when the dollar falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Economic Stimulus**: Lower Federal Reserve rates stimulate the economy, increasing oil and gas consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   **Undervalued Stock**: The stock is trading at 28-31 USD, down from 40-45 USD years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
*   **Dividend**: It offers an attractive 6% dividend payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
*   **Competitive Position**: Environmental policies limit new pipeline permits, strengthening the position of existing operators like Kinder Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.
*   **Increased Production**: U.S. natural gas production has significantly increased due to shale gas technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, leading to higher transportation volumes and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: The company trades at 10 times its distributable cash flow (real profits), significantly below its historical average of 15-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Its EV/EBITDA is 9, compared to a usual 12, implying a 50% upside if it returns to its historical multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>.

#### 2. American Homes 4 Rent (Real Estate)

This real estate investment company focuses on luxury apartments in high-demographic growth areas like Texas, Florida, and Atlanta, particularly in states attracting population due to more favorable tax situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.
*   **Undervalued**: The stock has dropped 30% from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Dividend**: It has a history of consistently increasing its dividend payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>.
*   **Lower Rates Benefit**: A drop in interest rates benefits real estate companies by reducing interest payments, increasing property values, and making dividend stocks more attractive compared to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**: Real estate assets perform well and protect against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Supply/Demand Imbalance**: Housing supply is limited in these states, while demand is rising, especially with expected rate cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Strong Financials**: The company has low leverage (28% of total assets financed) and 95% of its debt is at a fixed rate (3.6%), providing stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:14">[00:27:14]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: It is trading at 13 times earnings, below the sector's usual 16-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>. Druckenmiller emphasizes buying when a sector improves and is cheap, as the market is forward-looking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a>.

#### 3. Woodward (Industrial Components)

Woodward manufactures highly specialized parts for the aviation and industrial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:21">[00:29:21]</a>.
*   **Growing Demand**: Aviation continues to grow, and tourism is returning strongly post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>.
*   **Recurring Income**: A significant portion of its revenue comes from maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:57">[00:29:57]</a>.
*   **Defensive Stock**: Its results were flat even during the 2008 crisis, indicating a very defensive business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Strong Growth**: The company expects organic growth of 8-10% (high single digits) from 2023 to 2026, plus potential acquisitions and margin expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:03">[00:30:03]</a>. Its components' value per airplane is three times higher in new models, leading to expected 12% growth in the aviation line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. Earnings per share are projected to grow 14-18% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:28">[00:32:28]</a>, surpassing the growth expected in some large tech companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: While not "knock-down cheap," it's valued at 28 times earnings, which is cheaper than alternatives in other sectors with lower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

#### 4. Coherent (Industrial Components - Largest Bet)

Coherent is Druckenmiller's largest current investment, valued at $260 million of his own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. It manufactures highly specialized industrial components like measuring lasers and thermal imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Niche Market**: Its niche market applications lead to high profit margins and expected high growth (8-20% across electronics, telecom, industrial sectors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.
*   **Future-Focused Investment**: Current earnings per share have dropped, but Druckenmiller invests anticipating future recovery and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. This aligns with his philosophy: "the present is not what moves the shares on the stock market... we always have to imagine what the world will be like in 12 to 24 months to 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   **Industrial Sector Recovery**: The industrial sector experienced contraction but is expected to recover, especially with anticipated rate drops and inflation normalization. Coherent, like Kinder Morgan and Woodward, will benefit from increased industrial spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
*   **Growth Rebound**: After a projected decrease in 2024, the company's profits are expected to triple in subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Its high-tech industrial equipment provides a competitive advantage to customers, ensuring continued demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:17">[00:40:17]</a>.

> [!TIP] Druckenmiller's key advice: "If you're buying now what everyone else is investing in, where there's euphoria, you're buying at the worst possible time, whereas if you imagine the future, you'll be trying to imagine how that might be reflected differently in the prices of publicly traded securities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.

These new leaders are highly motivated, are now the largest shareholders, and have a proven history of building and selling successful companies, suggesting a powerful motivation to drive Teleperformance's value above their investment price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:23">[00:41:23]</a>.

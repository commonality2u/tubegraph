[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | George Soros]] is a prominent investor whose wealth has largely been generated by his unique concept: the theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Soros's Investment Performance

Since founding his fund in 1970, [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] has achieved spectacular results, with average annual returns of 25% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:33]</a>. A crucial aspect of his success is that he has not experienced significant losses in almost any financial crisis or difficult market year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. He emerged "quite strengthened" from periods such as 1987, 1990, the dot-com bubble, 2008, and 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:53]</a>. Like other great investors, [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] stood out by doing things differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:01:01]</a>.

## Soros's Background and the Genesis of Reflexivity

[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | George Soros]] was initially a [[soros_early_life_and_education | Hungarian refugee]] from World War II, fleeing the Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:15]</a>. His parents, who were middle class, managed to falsify papers, allowing him to go to the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:23]</a>. With some income, he was able to access the London Business School, a powerful institution that provided good credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:33]</a>.

[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] has stated that his real passion is philosophy, not investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:49]</a>. His mentor, Karl Popper, influenced him to merge philosophy with investment, which ultimately led to the development of his theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:57]</a>. After graduating, he faced difficulties finding a job due to a xenophobic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:09]</a>, even selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:22]</a>. He entered the financial world through a contact who was also Hungarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:33]</a>.

Interestingly, [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] began as a value investor, focusing on cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:42]</a>. However, [[the_evolution_of_soros_investment_philosophy | his philosophy evolved]] over the years to maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:51]</a>. He gained a reputation for identifying undervalued German stocks in the 1950s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:21]</a>. His successful reports for clients led to their support in founding his company, the Quantum Fund (initially called Soros Fund), with just $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:40]</a>. The fund's growth has been largely organic, driven by compound interest, as it eventually stopped accepting external clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:04:04]</a>.

## The Theory of Reflexivity and Financial Crises

[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] explains his theory in "The Alchemy of Finance," a book written in 1988-89 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:33]</a>. He argues that financial markets are inherently unstable and cannot be predicted like weather patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:06:17]</a>. If crises could be predicted, they wouldn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:22]</a>. This contrasts with the efficient market theory, which [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] dismisses as "nonsense" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:53]</a>, because participants act based on emotions and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:59]</a>.

His core idea is that the "observer influences the observed element" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:20]</a>. In financial markets, investors' collective vision about the market actively influences and even creates the market itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:35]</a>. If enough participants believe the market will fall and act on that belief, the fall may indeed occur, leading to a "self-fulfilling prophecy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:56]</a>. Therefore, success lies in understanding the perception investors will have of what the economy will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:56]</a>.

## Examples of Reflexivity in Crises

### The Dot-Com Bubble (2000)
[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] observed that in bubbles, once prices become disconnected from reality, small changes or news can trigger enormous falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:46]</a>. The peak of the dot-com bubble in 2000, for instance, coincided with Bill Gates stating that Microsoft shares were "incredibly overvalued" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:14:00]</a>. This, combined with bankruptcies of companies like Enron and WorldCom, led to a significant and irreversible market fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:25]</a>. Even as prices plummeted, fundamentals, driven by past capital flows, continued to decline due to inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:39]</a>. This period is particularly dangerous as "bargain hunters" appear, misinterpreting the fall as a buying opportunity based on outdated fundamental analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:58]</a>.

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 crisis, marked by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, saw the S&P 500 plummet by 58% from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:34]</a>. The market began to recover in March 2009, not because fundamentals immediately improved, but because it "decides based on small news items" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:55]</a>. In 2009, companies continued to report weak results for the first three to four quarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:17]</a>, yet the market experienced an "incredible rally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:18]</a>. This demonstrates that the market doesn't always anticipate events; instead, it's the market participants who produce changes in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:59]</a>.

The rising S&P, influenced by a "selling or buying climax," changed investor confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:07]</a>. Corporations, seeing the market rise and perceiving the worst as over, increased capital expenditures and bought back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:27]</a>. Central bankers, emboldened, injected liquidity, slowing credit contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:37]</a>. Although the economy didn't contract drastically (US GDP fell by 2.3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:45]</a>, a general fear had gripped the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:54]</a>. As the S&P rose, confidence was regained, credit flowed, and the economy reactivated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:18:02]</a>. This is a clear example of a reflective process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Modern Examples of Reflexivity

*   **REITs (SOCIMIs) in Spain**: Around two years ago, when REITs (Socimis) began listing in Spain, housing prices were recovering, but the market was still skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:22">[00:18:37]</a>. These vehicles started listing at premiums (1-2 times book value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:12]</a>. This allowed them to issue new shares at elevated prices and acquire assets in the private market at lower book values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:23]</a>. This process boosted earnings per share, convincing investors that these were "growth companies," leading to higher valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:30]</a>.
*   **The Downside of Reflexivity in REITs**: Recently, with a downturn in the Ibex and increased risk sentiment, REIT shares have fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:11]</a>. Now, if they issue capital at low prices (e.g., 0.8 times book value), it actively decreases earnings per share, reversing the positive cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:48]</a>. These situations, where fundamentals are modified by price action, are what [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]] advises to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:53]</a>.

[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | Soros]]'s insights derived from reflexivity enable investors to not only speculate but also to protect themselves from certain market events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:18]</a>. It emphasizes focusing on companies whose growth is financed by their own cash flow and profits, rather than by continuously increasing capital, which can create vicious cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:46]</a>.

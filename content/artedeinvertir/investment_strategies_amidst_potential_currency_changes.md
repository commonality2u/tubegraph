The global financial landscape is on the brink of a significant shift, with the dollar's long-standing dominance facing challenges from emerging powers. This shift could impact currency values, savings, investments, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Prominent investors like Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmiller have warned of the dollar's potential decline and have begun divesting from it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This article explores [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment strategies]] to protect against or even benefit from these impending currency changes.

## The Dollar's Declining Dominance

The dollar is currently the world's most important currency, granting the United States significant privileges it is now at risk of losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. China recognizes the immense power of holding the most important currency and aims to end the US's economic status to achieve its goal of becoming the world's greatest economic power within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### The Rise of BRICS

Historically, global power was centered around the G7, which includes the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, main European countries, and Japan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Recently, a new power group called BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) has emerged to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

BRICS holds significant potential for success against the G7 because it accounts for 43% of the world's population, compared to the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. More countries are joining BRICS to escape the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. BRICS has openly stated its plans to move away from the dollar's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. For example, Brazil's newly elected president, Lula da Silva, expressed his objective to end dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Privileges of Dollar Dominance

The status of the dollar as the world's reserve currency provides two key advantages to the United States:
1.  **Printing Money Without Significant Inflation**: The US can print large amounts of new dollars without generating significant inflation due to constant international demand for the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. For instance, to solve the 2020 crisis, 23% of the total dollars in circulation were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. In contrast, when Argentina increased its money supply by 80% to solve a crisis between 2017 and 2018, it led to 60% annual inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The US Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew by over 120% in less than 18 months during the 2020 crisis, yet inflation remained at only 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
2.  **Lower Interest Rates**: Dollar dominance allows the United States and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This creates a "virtuous circle" where a strong currency attracts more lending at cheaper rates, further strengthening the currency and allowing for more money printing with fewer consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

### Signs of Change

The roadmap to end dollar dominance was established at the BRICS Summit in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. China's Remambi (Yuan) is already gaining market share; since the beginning of the conflict, Russia's international market share has doubled from 2% to 4%, approaching that of the Euro, the second most important currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The dollar index has plummeted over 13% in less than nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The BRICS alliance proposes to trade within its territory using their own currencies, excluding the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This would increase the value and international demand for BRICS currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Key Factors for Global Currency Hegemony

The status of a world reserve currency is often associated with military supremacy, which guarantees economic security and currency prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Examples include Spain's currency between 1500 and 1700, the British Pound between 1800 and 1900, and the dollar for the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. China is significantly increasing its military spending, estimated to surpass that of the United States in less than five years, exceeding $500 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>.

Another strategy by China is to create a large, tax-free free trade area among all BRICS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Over 60% of the world's population is expected to join this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>.

## Expert-Recommended Investment Strategies

### Ray Dalio's Approach

Ray Dalio, a prominent investment fund manager, predicts the dollar's decline due to China's economic ascent and the US's decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. He advises [[investment_strategies_to_protect_against_dollar_devaluation | investors to protect themselves from the dollar's fall by investing in gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Why Gold?** Gold is considered the purest form of money because it cannot be printed out of thin air, offering protection against the decline in value of other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Gold has appreciated by an average of 9% annually over the last 20 years, even when measured against major currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Ways to Invest in Gold**:
    *   **Physical Gold**: Involves disadvantages like security and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   **Gold Mining Companies**: Can suffer from operational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
    *   **Gold ETFs**: Ray Dalio's preferred method. These represent ownership of the precious metal and are traded like shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
        *   **Gold Shares (GLD)**: Listed under ticker GLD at around $182 per share, with a year-to-date yield of 9.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
        *   **European Alternative (EGRN)**: Quoted at 35 euros for European investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller's Approach

Stanley Druckenmiller, an expert on currency values, has generated impressive returns of 30% per year for 30 years by investing mainly in currencies and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. He has expressed a lack of confidence in the Federal Reserve and Biden's actions, stating it's a good bet to sell dollars and buy gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Druckenmiller also finds **Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)** very interesting in a scenario of increased inflation caused by a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Why TIPS?** TIPS guarantee a return above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. Their price has been strong in the stock market as people assume inflation will not be high in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.
*   **Ways to Invest in TIPS**:
    *   **Direct Bond Purchase**: Can be complex for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   **ETFs Investing in TIPS**: An easier way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
        *   **Charles Schwab ETF on TIPS Bonds (SCP)**: Listed under ticker SCP at $54 per share, with an annual yield of 6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. If Druckenmiller is right, profits could double from price increase and annual yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.
        *   **BlackRock European ETF (ITPE)**: Listed under ITPE at 5 euros per share, available in a currency-hedged version to mitigate currency risk for non-dollar investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

## General Investment Strategies During Inflation and Currency Decline

If the dollar's value falls, leading to [[investment_strategies_during_inflation | inflation]], avoiding liquidity or traditional bonds unprotected against inflation is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Historically, [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | real estate investments]] and [[investment_strategies_during_economic_volatility | stock market investments]] have performed satisfactorily during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Additionally, operating in the **forex (foreign exchange) market** by selling one currency against another (e.g., USD against Chinese Yuan) is an option if a currency is expected to drop sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

## Stock Market Strategies for Dollar Decline and Chinese Economic Boom

### 1. American Export-Oriented Companies

Invest in American companies listed in dollars that have a significant export component to non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. When these companies export services or products abroad and convert foreign currencies into dollars, their profits would increase as the dollar weakens, leading to stock appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

*   **Example**: During Brexit, when the pound fell nearly 20%, main UK exporting companies like Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline rose sharply while the general stock market collapsed, providing real coverage against currency collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### 2. US Companies with Exposure to the Chinese Economy

Look for companies with a high degree of exports to China to benefit from its expected economic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>.
*   **Examples**: High-quality companies like Wynn and Las Vegas Sands casinos, and technology and semiconductor companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### 3. Luxury Sector Companies

Companies in the luxury sector, typically denominated in euros or dollars, are attractive because Chinese consumers have become the main buyers of these articles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. An economic boom in China would increase their sales, and converting those profits into euros or dollars would cause significant profit increases, acting as a real hedge against a dollar fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Louis Vuitton, Hermes, or Ferrari <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>. These companies have historically prospered in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Companies with Higher Exposure to Chinese Luxury Market**: (List implied to be displayed visually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:12">[00:19:12]</a>

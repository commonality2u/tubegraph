BlackRock, a company often described as the "owner of the world," wields tremendous power within the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. It controls more than 10 trillion dollars, making it the largest shareholder in the world's primary listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This figure represents over 10% of the world economy, exceeding the economic output of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Many sources accuse BlackRock of contributing to environmental damage, social inequality, or financial fraud due to its immense power and control over companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Leadership and Objectives

BlackRock is led by Larry Fink, its enigmatic CEO, who is considered one of the people with the greatest economic power globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Like any private company, BlackRock's primary objective is to generate profits from the funds provided by its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Client Base and Funding Mechanisms

BlackRock's significant purchasing power on a global level stems from its diverse client base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Its clients primarily include banks, insurers, pension plans, and sovereign funds from some of the wealthiest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Crucially, a significant portion of its capital also comes from small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

It is highly probable that if an individual has an investment plan offered by a bank, their money has indirectly or directly ended up with BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Even money deposited in a bank without direct investment may be invested by the bank for its own benefit, potentially finding its way into BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## BlackRock's Influence Over Banks

BlackRock controls the financial sector, often regarded as the "lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. With its vast funds, it holds majority positions in major global banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

A paradoxical relationship exists where many of these banks are BlackRock's main clients, providing it with increasing funds annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This allows BlackRock to expand its controlling position over key global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. BlackRock uses "iShares" as the commercial name to channel investments and acquire ownership in these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For instance, the main owners of Banco Santander's OTF funds are all from the iShares brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Similarly, BlackRock is a major shareholder in large American banks like JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. This pattern, where BlackRock or iShares names constantly appear, can be observed for most companies listed on the stock exchange via financial information websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

The company that owns a bank like Santander and controls its board of directors ends up receiving more money from the bank's own clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This enables BlackRock to purchase more bank shares, increasing its ownership and power over these financial entities, thus boosting its profits and global [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### BlackRock Solutions

BlackRock maintains a controversial division called BlackRock Solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. This division is responsible for auditing and controlling potential risks that major global banks might pose to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>. This gives BlackRock access to the intimate internal accounts and data of these banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This situation is paradoxical because BlackRock is simultaneously a main investor in these banks and responsible for controlling their internal risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. BlackRock claims that BlackRock Solutions operates as a completely separate entity with "Chinese walls" for information control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Market Dominance Through ETFs

BlackRock's power in the financial system is substantial. Even during the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve commissioned BlackRock to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Beyond wealthy economies, BlackRock is also a major lender to emerging countries, extending its [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | power]] and control to these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

The company primarily generates income by advising on financial products such as iShares, with 80% of its revenue coming from this source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. BlackRock identified an [[BlackRocks investment strategies and influence on markets | investment opportunity]] in creating Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that can be bought and sold as easily as stocks, thereby enabling the general public to easily invest in the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. In the United States, an estimated 60% of invested money is now passive, often in products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The widespread adoption of this investment style raises concerns about who truly controls companies, as individuals buying BlackRock products delegate voting rights to BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This concentrates [[Impact of BlackRock on financial systems | power]] in very few companies that end up controlling the world's main listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This creates circular structures where client funds empower BlackRock to control key companies, which in turn provide more funds, further increasing BlackRock's [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | power]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

## [[Ethical and competitive concerns related to BlackRocks power | Conflicts of Interest and Competition Concerns]]

This accumulation of [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | power]] also generates potential [[Ethical and competitive concerns related to BlackRocks power | conflicts of interest]] at the level of competition among different companies controlled by a single entity like BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. For example, while BlackRock may not be a top shareholder in McDonald's, it appears on the list of main shareholders for its competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>. This means the same company controls major players within a sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Many sources question the freedom of competition in sectors with a single owner, a phenomenon observed in the automotive, airline, and financial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Broader Market Control

In a recent CNN news story, it was highlighted that BlackRock and Vanguard collectively control over 15 trillion dollars in assets, rivaling the American economy's 23 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. These two companies are the main shareholders of 85% of the world's primary listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

BlackRock also exercises [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | power]] within the media sector, which is crucial for controlling public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. It is estimated that they control 95% of traditional or new generation media, appearing as the largest shareholders in companies like Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. In 2021, BlackRock leveraged its [[BlackRocks influence on the global economy | power]] to pressure companies such as ExxonMobil, one of the largest oil companies, to reduce its CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Risks and Future Trends in Investment

Passive investment, heavily influenced by BlackRock's ETFs, is seen by some as a potential financial "bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. Prominent investors like Michael Burry, who foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, have warned that passive investing and these ETFs represent a huge bubble due to the high valuations many companies are reaching regardless of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

The operation of these ETFs means that as a stock rises and gains relative weight in an index, automated purchasing systems are forced to buy more shares, further inflating valuations and attracting more passive investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>. Burry cautions that "the music will stop playing" for this investment style when capital outflows exceed inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>. He likens it to the game of musical chairs, where the longer the game is played, the higher the likelihood of being left without a chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>.

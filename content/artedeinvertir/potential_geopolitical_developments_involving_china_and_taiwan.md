The situation surrounding China and Taiwan is closely monitored due to its potential to trigger significant global [[geopolitical_risks | geopolitical risks]] and economic shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Perceived Parallels with Russia-Ukraine Conflict
There is a perceived parallel between China's stance on Taiwan and Russia's view of Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Just as Russia considered Ukraine to be its territory, China views Taiwan as belonging to it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This has led to numerous military tensions between China and Taiwan in recent months and years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

## Recent Military Activities
Recent reports indicate escalating military activities by China in the region:
*   On February 24th, Taiwan reported that nine Chinese fighter jets had entered or exceeded Taiwanese airspace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.
*   There has been a high concentration of Chinese military forces near Taiwan, reminiscent of Russia's troop buildup towards Ukraine in previous months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

## Potential International Reactions
The situation could lead to serious international repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Japan's Prime Minister has stated that if China were to invade Taiwan, Japan and the United States "could not stay aside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Japan has already declared its intention to intervene should an invasion occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   If a U.S. ally were to go to war with China over Taiwan, other countries would likely be compelled to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   The lack of direct military consequences for Russia after its invasion of Ukraine might lead China to believe it could take advantage of a similar situation, especially concerning a country not part of NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   This dynamic could become a significant area of friction in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Broader Implications
Beyond direct conflict, there are concerns about [[discussion_on_global_economic_changes_especially_related_to_china_and_the_us | broader economic changes]] if China were to align more closely with Russia and implement new economic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:42">[00:43:42]</a>. This could pose a major problem for companies with significant exposure to the Chinese market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:48">[00:43:48]</a>. Concerns have also been raised about the potential delisting of Chinese shares from international markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.

> The speaker advises investors to balance the risks of such developments with the potential value offered by good businesses, particularly when stock valuations become attractive due to temporary panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>.

## Chinese Companies in a Geopolitical Context
Companies like Alibaba have seen their valuations hit all-time lows, trading at historically low earnings multiples (e.g., 11-12 times earnings, or even less after accounting for cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>. This is partly due to broader concerns about China's economic and political environment, including threats of delisting and the perception of China potentially aligning with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>. Similarly, Tencent and Baidu have experienced significant falls due to these concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:18">[01:02:18]</a>. The fear in the stock market does not dissipate quickly, often lasting one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>.

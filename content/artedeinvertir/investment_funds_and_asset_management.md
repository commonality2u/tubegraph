The increasing public interest in [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investing]], finance, and stock analysis is a notable trend, with many seeking to learn more about these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This growing interest highlights the importance of understanding [[fund_management_and_investment_diversification_strategies | fund management]] and diverse [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment strategies]].

## Overview of Fund Management

The speaker's personal assets are primarily invested in the funds they manage, indicating a direct alignment with the [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investment strategies]] employed by these funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The management company oversees approximately 120 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, distributing investments across different fund types:
*   **True Value** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>
*   **True Value Small Caps** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>
*   **True Capital** (a newer fund investing in larger companies like [[alibaba|Alibaba]] and [[facebook|Facebook]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

### Advantages for Private Investors
While institutional funds manage large sums, private investors possess a significant advantage in "small caps" (companies with small market capitalizations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Investing with smaller amounts (e.g., 4-10 million euros) in these smaller companies can lead to higher returns than larger funds might achieve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, as demonstrated by the True Value Small Caps fund's superior performance compared to True Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Larger funds (100-200 million euros) find it more challenging to invest in such illiquid opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Strategies

The core [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investment strategy]] emphasizes long-term vision, often looking 3 to 5 years ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>. Key elements include:
*   **Value Investing**: Focusing on companies trading below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.
*   **Small and Mid Caps**: Historically, the speaker's success stems from investing in smaller companies, as recommended by figures like [[warren_buffett|Warren Buffett]] for higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:32">[00:30:32]</a>.
*   **Dichotomy of the Market**: Recognizing that while some market segments may exhibit euphoria and high valuations (e.g., growth stocks with no profits), others present opportunities with cheap stocks and pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.
*   **Operational Leverage**: Identifying companies where increasing sales lead to disproportionately higher profits due to stable costs (e.g., Cedon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:33">[00:27:33]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Building a [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | portfolio]] of 15-30 companies (or 20-25 when starting out) is crucial for safety and consistent returns, as individual stock performance is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>.
*   **Understanding the Business**: Investors must have a clear vision of a company's future sales and profits, not just its product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:18">[01:34:18]</a>.

### Specific Investment Examples
*   **IDT Corporation**: A company with a mature business generating strong cash flow used to reinvest in high-growth, disruptive technological ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The company employs a strategy of selling successful new businesses or creating spinoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Its founder, Mr. Howard Jonas, has generated significant shareholder value, with an average annual return of 20% over the last 10 years when including spinoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. IDT's new businesses include BOSS Revolution (money transfer) and Point of Sale terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. A key growth area is Net to Phone, a cloud communications service targeting Latin America and Spain, growing at 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. The sum of IDT's parts suggests a value of up to $50 per share, compared to its trading price of $19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   **Cedon**: Described as the "Amazon of Sweden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, this company was a spinoff of a Swedish firm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Initial analysis was challenging due to reports being in Swedish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Cedon is transitioning from a traditional sales model (1p) to a marketplace model (3p), which offers higher profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. The marketplace segment has grown at 86% and its EBITDA by 120% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Lockheed Martin**: A defense company, which tends to be undervalued when Democrats win elections due to a false belief in defense budget cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>. Its core products, like the F-35 fighter, are crucial for military supremacy and are rarely cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>. The company has historically increased profits even during periods of defense budget reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. Its stock is considered cheap relative to historical averages, with earnings per share growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.
*   **Nagarro**: A computer engineering company listed in Germany, growing significantly by utilizing offshore engineers in countries like India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>. It's a spinoff, aligning management's interests with shareholders through significant stock ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:22">[00:55:22]</a>. Its sales have quintupled in recent years, demonstrating strong growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:57">[00:55:57]</a>.
*   **Happy Group**: An investment in the True Small Caps Group fund. This company installs and maintains fire alarm systems, electrical installations, and manages liquid waste <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. About 80% of its income is very stable and recurrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. It's also an SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) founded by Martin Franklin, known for generating substantial shareholder value in previous ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>.
*   **Nomad Foods**: A European frozen food company that has made strategic acquisitions (e.g., Findus) to optimize operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. It offers a stable market segment, with consistent free cash flow, and is considered cheap compared to its historical averages for food consumption companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a>.
*   **Enbridge**: A company with monopolies on gas and oil transportation in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>. It is currently undervalued, trading at about 8 times normalized earnings compared to its historical average of 16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. It offers a high and sustainable dividend yield (around 7.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:01">[01:39:01]</a>.

### Market Outlook and Volatility
The market, while a little expensive overall, is not at extreme bubble levels like the Nikkei index at its peak of 100 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. Low interest rates and continuous money injection by the Federal Reserve (Fed) are driving the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:59">[01:24:59]</a>.

[[understanding_investment_funds_performance | Market volatility]] is a normal and expected part of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Historically, there's a 10% market fall approximately every 12 months, and a fall greater than 20% every 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. Major drops of 40-50% occur every 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:54">[01:18:54]</a>.

**Strategy for Market Falls:**
*   Do not overreact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>.
*   Maintain some liquidity (10-20% in funds, personally as well) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>.
*   Utilize drops to buy good stocks at more attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>. This disciplined approach can lead to benefiting from market rebounds to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>.

The course covers comprehensive aspects from foundational knowledge to [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | managing investment portfolios]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. It also includes an investment club where participants follow a real portfolio process, analyze detailed investment cases, and receive follow-up on ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The aim is to teach individuals "how to fish" rather than simply giving them "the fish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

*   Start with a solid foundation and a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:02">[01:15:02]</a>.

*   Understand that investing is a long-term mechanism for wealth generation, requiring common sense, rationality, and patience, not a get-rich-quick scheme <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>.
*   Be wary of guaranteed profitability, as it often signals scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:29">[01:16:29]</a>.

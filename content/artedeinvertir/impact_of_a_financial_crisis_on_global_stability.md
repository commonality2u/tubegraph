An approaching [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets | new economic scenario]] is anticipated to affect everyone, with a potential economic disaster drawing closer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This situation poses a risk of total collapse for the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Warnings from Janet Yellen

Janet Yellen, the current Director of the American Treasury and former Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, has voiced grave concerns about this impending risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. She warned that if a solution is not found in the coming weeks, it would cause irreversible damage to the American economy and to global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Yellen has not specified an exact date for the potential collapse but has indicated it would have terrible consequences for both stocks and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

In an interview with CNBC, Yellen described creating crises periodically, or even self-manufactured crises, that jeopardize the financial and economic system, especially during a recovery from a deep crisis, as "tremendously irresponsible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:43">[01:41:43]</a>.

## The US Debt Ceiling Crisis

The current crisis stems from the United States operating with a fiscal deficit, consistently spending more money than it earns, primarily financed by issuing new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>. A debt ceiling was established years ago to limit the amount of debt the U.S. could incur, and this limit is about to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>.

The financial markets are already pricing in a potential bankruptcy of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:16">[03:16:16]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDs), which are insurance policies against government debt default, have seen their price to insure American government debt multiply by more than nine times due to the risk of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:40">[03:42:40]</a>. This indicates that financial markets perceive an enormous risk of the United States defaulting on its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>.

### Global Interconnectedness

A country defaulting on its debt would lead to total chaos and financial collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:13">[04:13:13]</a>. This is especially true for the United States, as the entire global financial system is connected to American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:20">[04:20:20]</a>. American debt bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:24">[04:24:24]</a>, having grown exponentially to a figure of $30 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:33">[04:33:33]</a>.

As investor Ray Dalio explains, one country's debt is another person's asset, and millions of entities worldwide hold significant amounts of these treasury bills and bonds, which were once considered the safest investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:38">[04:38:38]</a>.

### Potential Chain Effect

A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect, impacting banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans that have invested heavily in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:54">[04:54:54]</a>. This situation would be similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but multiplied by 30 times, as the total U.S. debt balance is 30 times higher than Lehman Brothers' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>.

The White House commissioned a report explaining the possible consequences of a debt default:
*   More than 2 million jobs would be lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:20">[06:20:20]</a>.
*   An additional annual cost of over $750 billion in interest would be incurred due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:24">[06:24:24]</a>.
*   The dollar and the stock market would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:33">[06:33:33]</a>.

### Impact on Markets

In the event of a U.S. debt default:
*   The value of dollar bonds and fixed income would collapse as investors lose confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:26">[05:26:26]</a>.
*   The value of stocks and equity investments would fall sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:36">[05:36:36]</a>.
*   The White House estimates stock market drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:26">[11:26:26]</a>.
*   The price of gold would likely rise sharply, as its price is measured against the American dollar, providing a safe haven if the dollar collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:44">[05:44:44]</a>.
*   Certain investments would rise, such as gold-related companies (mining, royalty) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a>.
*   Inverse ETFs, which rise when the market goes down, could also benefit, though historically they perform poorly long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:13">[10:13:13]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions

Janet Yellen has already started taking desperate measures, including significantly cutting investments in pension and health plans, and suspending government investments for employee retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:52">[01:52:52]</a>. These cuts amount to over $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. Yellen warned that these extraordinary measures provide limited time and are likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:02">[09:02:02]</a>.

The most viable solution is an agreement between Republicans and Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:42">[06:42:42]</a>. However, desperate solutions are being proposed, including the minting of a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:56">[06:56:56]</a>. This seemingly comical solution is real due to a legal loophole in American law allowing the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:25">[07:25:25]</a>. These coins would be deposited at the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to pay expenses without defaulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:08">[08:08:08]</a>.

While this solution could work in the short term, it would not send a message of stability to the financial markets, as it is "not a very serious way of managing the richest country in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:37">[08:37:37]</a>. In this scenario, the value of the dollar, bonds, and stocks would also continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:47">[08:47:47]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Historical Context
> The debt limit scenario was previously reached in 2011 and 2013. Although temporary solutions were found, the markets experienced high volatility in the subsequent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:34">[11:34:34]</a>.

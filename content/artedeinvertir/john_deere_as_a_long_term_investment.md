Bill Gates, widely recognized for co-founding Microsoft, is also an accomplished investor with a portfolio exceeding $40 billion, concentrated in a few key stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His investment strategy, which has yielded excellent results historically, often involves focusing on market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. One prominent holding in his portfolio is John Deere, an industrial machinery company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Investment in John Deere

John Deere represents 3.7% of Bill Gates' portfolio, making it his sixth-largest position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Gates has consistently been bullish on sectors related to food production in recent years, citing concerns about potential shortages and the increasing global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This perspective aligns with his significant landholdings, as he is one of the largest landowners in the United States, known for his [[bill_gates_investment_in_arable_land | accumulation of farmland]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. His investment in John Deere, a leading manufacturer of agricultural equipment, directly supports his outlook on [[agricultural_investment_opportunities | agricultural investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## Market Leadership and Competitive Advantage

John Deere is a clear market leader in the agricultural machinery sector, surpassing competitors like ACO and Case in market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Surveys indicate that up to 60% of American farmers utilize John Deere machinery, often alongside other brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Its leadership stems from its technological prowess, favorable quality-to-price ratio, and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>.

## Cyclicality and Financial Prudence

The agricultural machinery business is cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Farmers tend to delay new machinery purchases when commodity prices are low, extending the life of older equipment through increased maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, when economic conditions improve and farmers' earnings increase, they are more inclined to invest in new equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, the inflation crisis has significantly boosted food and raw material prices, benefiting companies like John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Despite its cyclical nature, John Deere has consistently remained a profitable company, generating positive cash flow even during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Its management operates prudently, enabling the company to weather various economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. For investors seeking passive income, John Deere is notable for continuously increasing its dividends for over 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, with a 64% increase since 2020 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Profit margins from equipment sales have seen significant expansion, rising from around 7-8% in 2013 to 15% recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Bill Gates' continued bullish stance suggests confidence that this profitability can persist, potentially mirroring the extended period of high profitability seen between 2000 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Integration of Artificial Intelligence

In a traditional sector like agriculture, John Deere stands out for its adoption of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technological advancements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The company manufactures self-piloted tractors that can operate autonomously, guided by GPS, even returning to storage sheds after completing tasks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. These intelligent machines can detect obstacles and automatically stop, enhancing efficiency and safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

This integration of technology provides John Deere with a significant competitive advantage over smaller rivals, allowing it to command higher prices for its products due to the substantial time and labor savings for farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Developing such sophisticated systems requires substantial investment, and John Deere's financial strength enables it to allocate nearly $2 billion annually to research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## Growth Outlook and Valuation

The agricultural equipment sector is projected to grow at a rate of 7% annually, more than double the general economic growth rate of 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. As a dominant brand, John Deere could potentially grow even faster than the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. Bill Gates likely anticipates a growth rate exceeding 10% for the company, which, combined with its dividend payments or share buybacks, could deliver double-digit returns for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Despite its strong fundamentals and growth prospects, John Deere's valuation has become more attractive. It is currently trading at approximately 11 times earnings, a significant drop from peaks of 25 times earnings in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. This valuation is comparable to the lows seen during the Covid-19 pandemic, indicating that while its stock price has not fallen rapidly, its earnings have risen, making the company relatively cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The current situation contrasts with the bearish cycle for raw materials experienced around 2014, when the stock was even cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

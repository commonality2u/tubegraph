[[real_estate_investment_profitability | Real estate investment]] can be highly profitable when executed correctly, and one significant factor contributing to this profitability is the strategic use of debt, commonly known as leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## What is Leverage?
Leverage, in the financial world, refers to the effect of using borrowed capital to increase the potential return of an [[methods_of_real_estate_investment | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. When used wisely in [[real_estate_investment_profitability | real estate investments]], this approach can lead to significantly higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

## Leverage in Action: A Case Study
Consider a property valued at €200,000. After deducting management, occupancy, and maintenance expenses, the net annual income from rent is €7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

### Without Leverage (for comparison)
If an investor buys this property outright for €200,000, the rental profitability would be 3.5% (€7,000 / €200,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Given that properties typically appreciate by an average of 3% per year in the long term, the total annual return would be approximately 6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### With Leverage
A more sophisticated investor might choose to use a loan. Banks are often willing to finance 70-80% of a [[real_estate_investment_profitability | real estate investment]] because they consider property a secure asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

[!example|Leverage Example]
Let's assume the investor borrows 70% of the property's value:
*   **Property Cost:** €200,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>
*   **Loan Amount (70%):** €140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>
*   **Investor's Own Capital:** €60,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>
*   **Annual Net Rental Income (before loan interest):** €7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>
*   **Annual Interest Expense (at 2% on €140,000):** €2,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>
*   **Net Income After Interest:** €7,000 - €2,800 = €4,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>

With this new net income, the **rental profitability** is calculated against the investor's own capital:
€4,200 (Net Income) / €60,000 (Investor's Capital) = 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. This effectively doubles the initial rental profitability from the previous scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Revaluation with Leverage
Just as properties generate rental income, they also tend to appreciate in value over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   If a €200,000 property appreciates by 3% annually, its value increases by €6,000 each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   When only €60,000 of the investor's own capital is involved, this €6,000 revaluation represents a 10% return on the invested capital (€6,000 / €60,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Total Return with Leverage
Combining both components:
*   Rental Profitability: 7%
*   Revaluation Return: 10%
*   **Total Annual Return:** 17% (before taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

## Considerations for Real Estate Investment
While this looks straightforward on paper, [[challenges_and_benefits_of_real_estate_investment | real estate investment]] in the real world involves many variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Success requires:
*   Understanding how to value properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
*   Identifying properties with high potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
*   Selecting reliable tenants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   Negotiating effectively with banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

This specialized knowledge, combined with passion, dedication, and effort, can lead to spectacular results in [[real_estate_investment_profitability | real estate investment]], similar to what can be achieved in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Ways to Invest in Real Estate
There are three fundamental ways to invest in real estate, each with its own advantages and disadvantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>:

### 1. Direct Investment
This involves directly purchasing a property and managing all aspects, including renting and eventual sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Potentially the most profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   Offers the greatest control over the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Requires significant initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Limited diversification possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   Very time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   Demands extensive knowledge to execute correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

### 2. Real Estate Funds
These funds are typically marketed by banks or independent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Requires minimal time commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Can be started with a very low initial [[understanding_financial_metrics_and_valuations | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Lack of transparency, making it difficult to know how investments are being managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Often requires a period of permanence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   Generally the least profitable of the three methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### 3. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
Known as "Socimis" in Spain, these are publicly listed investment vehicles that invest in real estate properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. They buy, rent, and eventually sell properties to reinvest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Key Features:**
    *   Enjoy multiple tax advantages, including often being exempt from paying corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
    *   Legally required to distribute 90% of their profits to shareholders in the form of dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.
    *   Offer potential for revaluation as their shares are traded on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Advantages:**
    *   Requires a small initial [[understanding_financial_metrics_and_valuations | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   Highly liquid assets, allowing for easy buying and selling of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   Offers high diversification possibilities, enabling investment in properties globally (e.g., US, Canada, Europe) regardless of your location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages:**
    *   Profitability may be lower than direct [[real_estate_investment_profitability | investment]], but higher than real estate funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   Shares traded on the stock market can be volatile, which might make novice investors nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

Michael Burry is a renowned investor celebrated for his accurate prediction of the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His rise to fame was significantly boosted by the movie *The Big Short*, produced by Brad Pitt and starring Christian Bale as Burry, which was nominated for five Oscars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Early Career and Scion Capital

Before becoming a legendary investor, Michael Burry was a medical doctor by profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He began combining his passion for the stock market with his medical work in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. Burry was highly active on various internet forums and blogs, where he shared his investment ideas and demonstrated good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

His early success led some investors to offer him $1 million to start his own investment fund, leading to the birth of Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. The fund quickly showed impressive results, especially in its first five years when it invested almost exclusively in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. For instance, in its first year, Scion Capital generated an 8% return while the S&P 500 fell 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. In its second year, the fund achieved a 55% return, with the S&P 500 declining by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. By the third year (2002), it saw a 16% return while the S&P 500 dropped 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Thanks to these strong performances, investors flocked to provide him with capital, and within five years, he was managing over $500 million for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The 2008 Financial Crisis Bet

As depicted in *The Big Short*, [[Michael Burrys prediction of a stock market crisis | Burry's investment style]] radically shifted around 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He began investing his entire fund against the impending crisis, a challenging period as his bet initially did not pay off, causing nervousness among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

However, the crisis became evident in 2007 and 2008, and his significant bet yielded enormous benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. In 2007 alone, his fund generated a 160% return, cementing his legendary status in the investment fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Scion Capital earned over $700 million in profits for its investors, and Burry's personal fortune quickly exceeded $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. The fund achieved an accumulated annual return of 700% for its clients, making it one of the most successful funds during its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Burry's story is particularly motivating, as he is an ordinary person who achieved extraordinary success in finance without a related academic background, industry contacts, or prior experience, relying purely on effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

## Current Investment Portfolio

Currently, [[Michael Burrys investment portfolio and the six stocks he holds | Michael Burry has concentrated his stock portfolio]] into just six stocks, representing a net worth of approximately $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. [[Analysis of individual stocks in Michael Burry's portfolio | These six positions]] are:

*   **Gamestop (GME)**: This company, a leader in video game and entertainment product sales in the United States, holds a 28% weighting in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. Despite a significant drop in share price (from $45 to $5) due to the shift from physical stores to online sales, Burry is an active shareholder, proposing significant management changes to benefit shareholders and potentially regularize the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. It is considered a daring and somewhat risky investment, but with potential for long-term performance if online sales problems are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
*   **Tailored Brands (TLRD)**: This fashion and accessories retailer for men constitutes 22% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. After strong growth in the 2000s, the company has stagnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Burry's investment again shows a bet on the retail sector and stocks at historical lows, trading at an attractive P/E ratio of five times next year's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.
*   **Google (GOOGL)**: Accounting for 16% of his portfolio, Google represents a high-quality company available at historically good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Burry mixes contrarian stocks with solid, good-quality companies trading at reasonable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Google fits into this category of high-quality at a reasonable price, currently trading at $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Portman Warehouse (PWH)**: This outdoor sports retailer (climbing, camping, hunting, firearms) makes up 14% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. The company shows solid growth, driven by the outdoor sports niche market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Burry reportedly invested around $4 per share, and it currently trades at $8, remaining in his portfolio due to its attractive valuation of only 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Bed Bath & Beyond (BBBY)**: With a 13% weighting, this company sells household items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. It is another retail company in a currently out-of-favor, beaten-down sector, offering attractive valuations despite certain risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. The main threat comes from online sales companies like Amazon, which puts pressure on its shares, but it trades at a low price of seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)**: This oil producer in Canada holds an 8% weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. It is the largest oil producer in Canada, with a production of one million barrels per day and a market capitalization over $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Canadian Natural Resources is a pioneer in oil sands technology, an innovative process for extracting oil from land with small percentages of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. The company quickly rose from $4 to $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It is one of the most solid raw materials companies, with 19 consecutive years of dividend increases, currently yielding 4% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. Despite negativity surrounding the energy sector, the market offers these shares at an attractive valuation of only seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

## Investment Style and Philosophy

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry's investment style]] has been well-documented from his early days active on forums and blogs. His [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and advice for stock market success | main investment advice]] includes:

> [My investment strategy] is not very complex. I try to buy shares in ignored companies when it seems that they are going to go bankrupt and I sell them when they have improved slightly. The management of my portfolio is so important like company selection if I can do both well, I will be successful. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>

This approach explains his strong inclination towards the retail and energy sectors, which are currently out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. These sectors contain cheap companies where significant "regularizations" (improvements) could occur if fears subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Regarding portfolio management, Burry prefers a concentrated portfolio:

> I like to have between 12 and 18 stocks in my portfolio... this number of positions I feel it gives me room to have my best ideas while smoothing out volatility so as not to confuse portfolio volatility with portfolio risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>

Anything under 25 stocks in a portfolio is considered concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>, a philosophy aligned with other great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, who favor concentrating on high-conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Burry also demonstrates flexibility in his investment choices:

> I'm also delighted to add to the portfolio the companies that Warren Buffett likes with a competitive advantage, high return on capital if the market offers them at good prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>

This highlights his willingness to invest in high-quality companies with competitive advantages, like Google, especially when they are offered at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This flexibility allows him to both pursue contrarian ideas and invest in more popular companies if they are reasonably priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

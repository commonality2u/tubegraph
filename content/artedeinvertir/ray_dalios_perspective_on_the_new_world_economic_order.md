The world is on the cusp of a "new world economic order," a significant economic and social reform with serious implications for the stock market and the global economy, according to renowned investor [[ray_dalios_alarming_predictions_about_new_economic_crises | Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This emerging scenario could lead to a major crisis in the U.S. and the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Who is Ray Dalio?
[[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | Ray Dalio]] is a globally recognized investor, founder of Bridgewater Associates, an investment fund managing $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He is often referred to as the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the high reliability of his [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | predictions]] about the future of the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Dalio is also an acclaimed author and speaker, having participated in significant events like the World Economic Forum in Davos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Great Cycle and the New World Order
[[global_economic_challenges_by_ray_dalio | Ray Dalio]] explains that economic history follows a "great cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. A previous new world order was established in 1945 after World War II, which determined global divisions and created the U.S. dollar as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This established a dominant power, leading to a period of peace and prosperity, but this is now "about to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Dalio]] also warns that recent political extremism in the U.S. will accelerate the shift towards this new economic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The U.S. Entering a Decline Phase
Through historical study, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions_for_2025 | Ray Dalio]] observes that every dominant economy, like the U.S. for the last 70 years, experiences phases of economic rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. He indicates that the U.S. is currently entering a decline phase, primarily characterized by:
*   **High Levels of Debt**: An increasing amount of debt within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Alarming Money Printing**: The printing of money in excessive quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

These factors lead to economic and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. In contrast, China is currently in an upward phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Consequences of Money Printing and Debt
The printing of record amounts of money by the U.S. Federal Reserve since the 2008 financial crisis—from $1 trillion to over $7 trillion—has already shown consequences in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. This has led to:
*   [[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | Inflation]] levels not seen for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   Significant increases in the prices of raw materials, products, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

[[ray_dalios_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] criticizes the "helicopter money theory," where massive amounts of money are printed and distributed to stimulate the economy after a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. He argues that if this were a true solution, countries like Zimbabwe would be the wealthiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Historically, this economic recipe has led to ruin in countries such as Germany, Argentina, Venezuela, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Extreme Economic Inequality
[[global_economic_challenges_by_ray_dalio | Ray Dalio]] highlights the alarmingly high level of economic inequality in the U.S., where, for instance, three individuals can accumulate more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. The wealthiest 1% of the American economy has continuously prospered over the last 40 years, accumulating increasing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Historically, this social inequality leads to three significant economic problems that impact savings and investments:
1.  **Rising Taxes**: Taxes are expected to increase in the U.S. and globally, as seen with proposals from Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This negatively affects the stock market by decreasing company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions**: Economic conditions will deteriorate, with the Federal Reserve already warning of future interest rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This particularly harms highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
3.  **Increased Regulations and Wealth Redistribution**: An increase in new regulations and measures aimed at redistributing wealth will negatively impact almost any type of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Investment Recommendations for the New Economic Order
[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] advises against selling everything and holding liquidity in an inflationary environment, as the value of money will decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Instead, he recommends staying invested but in "correct investments" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. His investment philosophy aims to perform well in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Portfolio Allocation
[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] suggests:
*   **40% in Stocks**: Stocks tend to perform well in this new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
    *   Based on a Bank of America study covering 50 years of stock market history, the best sectors in a future scenario of rising inflation are **energy** and **raw materials** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)**: An example of a company in the energy sector, trading at an attractive valuation with a strong dividend growth history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **10% in Gold**: [[ray_dalios_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] asserts that gold will always perform well if this new world order materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
    *   The printing of money decreases bond value and transfers wealth to financial assets, historically raising gold and stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
    *   **Investment Methods**:
        *   **Gold ETFs**: The easiest way, such as GLD (U.S.) or iShares (GN) in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
        *   **Gold Mining Companies**: More complex due to operational risks, but can offer higher upside if gold prices rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Investing in a group of these companies through an ETF like GDX (Gold Miners ETF) can mitigate individual company risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

## The Biggest Risk: Government Bankruptcy and Conflict
[[ray_dalios_alarming_predictions_about_new_economic_crises | Ray Dalio]] considers the biggest risk and his primary concern to be **government bankruptcy**, which he identifies as the single most important advanced indicator of wars and revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. This risk is exacerbated by large economic inequalities and class differences after economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. While not immediate, if the economy continues its current trajectory, it could reach an inflection point with severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

In such a scenario, stocks manufacturing personal defense products, like **Axon Enterprise (AXON)**, would likely perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Since 2008, when social inequality began to rise, AXON shares have appreciated significantly due to high demand for its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

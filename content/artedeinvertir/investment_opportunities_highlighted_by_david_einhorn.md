[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] is one of Wall Street's most respected investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, known for achieving average annual returns exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He rose to fame by predicting and profiting from the collapse of Lehman Brothers several months before it led to a major financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

Einhorn started his first [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | investment]] fund, Greenlight Capital, in 1996 at 28 years old with a starting capital of $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This fund grew from $1 million to over $12 billion under his management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Einhorn is also an expert poker player, having participated in the World Series of Poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. In 2006, he finished 28th out of over 10,000 participants in a prestigious tournament, donating his prize of over $650,000 to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Alzheimer's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Investment Approach: Investor Activist

[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] is known as an "investor activist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This approach involves:
*   **Long-term investment:** Investing in [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stocks]] considered undervalued or with strong prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.
*   **Shorting:** Investing against [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stocks]] believed to be overvalued or with poor prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

This dual strategy allows for satisfactory results in any market environment, as short positions can support the portfolio during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Einhorn is also considered a very conservative investor, which has enabled him to navigate previous market bubbles effectively, such as those in 2000 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Bubble Predictions

In a recent letter to his investors, [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] gave an exact date for the end of the current market bubble, a rare specific prediction from him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

> [!QUOTE]
> "We are in the middle of a huge technological bubble. Our working hypothesis tells us that September 2nd, 2020, marked the market ceiling and that the bubble has already begun to deflate. Investor sentiment is changing from greed to complacency. We have adjusted our portfolio according to this hypothesis, adding short positions in many low-quality stocks that are trading at very high valuations." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>

Einhorn notes that the Nasdaq index, which he considers overvalued, reached highs around 12,500 on September 2nd, 2020, and has not touched that level since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Symptoms of a Bubble

Einhorn identifies several symptoms indicating the current technological bubble:
1.  **High Number of IPOs:** Historically correlated with market cycle changes, indicating high investor appetite for new technology companies, with some IPOs seeing over 200% revaluations on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
2.  **High Number of Unprofitable Listed Companies:** Currently, an impressive 80% of listed companies are not making profits, surpassing the record set during the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
3.  **High Degree of Speculation:** Illustrated by the Hertz car rental company, which went bankrupt but saw its shares propelled to a higher price (up to $5 per share) than before its bankruptcy announcement ($3 per share) due to speculative fever <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The American regulator SEC had to intervene to prevent the company from selling worthless shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Despite bankruptcy, the number of investors holding Hertz shares tripled to over 140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
4.  **Abnormal Stock Performance After Splits:** Popular [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stocks]] like Tesla (+50%) and Apple (+30%) saw significant revaluations immediately after announcing splits, even though splits are fundamentally neutral events that do not add value to companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Specific Investment Opportunities and Positions

### [[david_einhorns_short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | David Einhorn's Short Positions]]

#### Amazon (AMZN)
While acknowledging Amazon as a great company and one of the best-listed businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, Einhorn believes its current valuation is excessive due to its recent market surge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Amazon's sales grew by 37% and operating cash flow by over 56%, indicating strong operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. Based on an estimated EBITDA of over $100 billion in the next three years and a historical average valuation of 26 times EBITDA, Amazon's value could reach $5,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

#### Tesla (TSLA)
[[david_einhorns_short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | David Einhorn]] has a long-standing bearish position against Tesla, which has caused significant losses for his fund, Greenlight Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Einhorn has publicly accused Tesla of manipulating its accounts to artificially inflate profits and playing with investor expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. He specifically claims Tesla artificially increases income with sales of non-existent cars and leverages future tax credits to boost reported profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Tesla is currently trading at over 140 times its estimated 2021 earnings per share of $3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Investing against an overvalued stock can be very dangerous, as [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] has experienced with Tesla over the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

### Optimistic [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | Investments]]

#### VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX)
[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] has invested over $67 million in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) in the last quarter to benefit from a potential rise in gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. He believes that the extensive money printing by central banks (over $3.3 trillion in 2020 alone, representing 22% of all dollars in circulation in 2019) will lead to inflation, which is positive for gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This gold ETF has appreciated over 50% in the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

#### Green Brick Partners (GRBK)
Einhorn has invested an impressive 31% of his portfolio in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), a homebuilder operating in the fast-growing Atlanta and Texas regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. His fund, Greenlight Capital, has invested over $280 million and controls 48% of the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. The company benefits from low interest rates, significant growth in the construction sector, and increased demand for housing outside urban centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>. Green Brick Partners has seen its pre-tax profit increase by over 100% compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a> and has tripled its profits over the last four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. The company boasts high growth, strong profit margins, and low debt compared to competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Based on estimated earnings of $3 per share in the next two years and a historical P/E of 12 for homebuilders, the stock could reach a valuation of $36, representing a significant potential realization from its current $21 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. This potential gain is a key reason for Einhorn's substantial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

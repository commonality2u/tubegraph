This article explores the **Theory of Inelastic Markets**, a concept highlighted by famous investor Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a>. Burry's recent decision to sell the majority of his shares has puzzled the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, and his insights, particularly those shared on social media, provide crucial clues for understanding his strategic moves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Investment Philosophy and Market Concerns
Michael Burry, whose story was popularized in "The Big Short," began as a value investor, seeking undervalued small-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:22">[02:38:22]</a>. He successfully grew a small fund from $1 million to $600 million before anticipating the subprime mortgage crisis in 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>. His public portfolio, required for professional investors managing over $100 million in US assets, has generated annual returns of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

Burry has consistently warned about a dangerous investment environment, particularly concerning sectors like tech stocks, renewable energy, and cryptocurrencies, which exhibit significant euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:39">[04:15:39]</a>. He emphasizes that while the market may not decline immediately, the conditions are risky <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:17">[04:30:17]</a>.

## The Theory of Inelastic Markets
The **theory of inelastic markets** posits that a dollar of new money invested into the market generates significantly more than a dollar of market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. Studies suggest a ratio of 5-8 dollars of value created for every new dollar, with some even proposing up to 10 or 20 times the value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>. This occurs because when the market is rising, there's limited supply and high demand for shares, making it harder to find sellers at lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:45">[06:01:45]</a>.

This effect works in both directions: when money exits the market, for every dollar withdrawn, it can destroy three to five dollars of market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:07">[09:07:07]</a>. This leads to more pronounced and faster market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:15">[18:39:15]</a>.

### Factors Accelerating Inelasticity
Several factors contribute to and accelerate this inelastic effect:
*   **[[impact_of_passive_and_indexed_investment_on_market_dynamics | Passive and indexed investment]]**: These funds are agnostic to price, meaning they must buy shares to maintain specific index weights regardless of valuation, compelling them to acquire whatever is available at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:02">[14:40:02]</a>. This distorts the market and acts like "throwing gasoline on a fire" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:54:33">[17:54:33]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks**: Companies aggressively buying back their own shares reduce the available supply, further driving up prices when demand is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:25">[15:13:25]</a>.
*   **Retail Investors and New Money**: Recent years have seen significant net inflows of capital from retail investors who were previously out of the market, destabilizing traditional market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:07">[09:19:07]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: New money entering the market often comes with leverage (e.g., 1:2, 1:3, or even 1:10), amplifying the multiplier effect. A single new dollar can become a $20 multiplier in the market due to leverage and inelasticity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:07">[11:07:07]</a>.
*   **Increased Access to Information**: Faster information dissemination means the market reacts more quickly to perceived economic or corporate profit trends, leading to accelerated directional movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>.

### Market Behavior and Consequences
The theory suggests that market drops will become more accelerated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:16">[22:29:16]</a>. Historical examples like the 2015 summer panic (Yuan devaluation), the 2018 market outflow, and the March 2020 COVID-19 crisis show rapid, vertical declines where highly indexed stocks opened down 20% or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:10:00">[20:10:00]</a>. However, these sharp falls often lead to quick recoveries, unlike historical crises that took years to rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:42:00">[21:42:00]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Recent Portfolio Moves
In alignment with his concerns, Michael Burry has drastically reduced his public portfolio to just $41 million, a significant drop from previous quarters that saw values between $150-$300 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:02:00">[27:02:00]</a>. He has liquidated almost all positions, including put options on Tesla, and bullish bets on Facebook and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:00">[27:36:00]</a>. His strategy appears to be moving to liquidity in anticipation of market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:50:00">[27:50:00]</a>.

However, he has made some new small purchases in a seemingly negative environment:

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)
*   **Business Overview**: A defense weapons manufacturer, producing sophisticated defense pieces like the F-18, F-22 Raptor, and F-35 fighter jets, combat transport helicopters, and missile defense systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:21:00">[34:21:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Manufactures unique, essential defense products that few others in the world can replicate, giving it pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:47:00">[34:47:00]</a>.
*   **Sector Characteristics**: Non-cyclical with predictable income, as defense budgets are less tied to general economic conditions than consumer spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:03:00">[35:03:00]</a>.
*   **Recent Performance**: The stock declined after a profit warning indicating a slight revenue decrease in 2022 and low single-digit growth (2-4%) for subsequent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:08:00">[36:08:00]</a>.
*   **Company Strategy**: Lockheed Martin plans to use its strong balance sheet and low debt to aggressively buy back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:02:00">[37:02:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading at 12-13 times normalized earnings, near its historical minimum valuation range, while its historical average has been around 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:17:00">[56:17:00]</a>. This suggests potential undervaluation, especially given its business quality and predictability compared to the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:47:00">[58:47:00]</a>.

### CVS Health (CVS)
*   **Business Overview**: A large healthcare company ($120 billion market cap) with diverse business lines, including health plans (insurances) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:14">[01:04:14]</a>.
*   **Sector Characteristics**: The healthcare sector in the US is lucrative and predictable, as people continue to pay for medical expenses and insurance regardless of economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Performance**: CVS Health has historically benefited from its strong business model, generating good cash flow and enabling share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:56">[01:04:56]</a>. The company recently increased its 2021 profit guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trading at an estimated 11-12 times profit, a low valuation given its growth and stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:21]</a>. Historically, the healthcare sector has been undervalued due to political threats (e.g., Obamacare), similar to how the defense sector was perceived in the 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:58">[01:06:58]</a>.

### DistributionNOW (DNOW)
*   **Business Overview**: A distributor of components and consumables for the oil and gas sector (e.g., valves, tanks, compression stations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:31">[01:17:31]</a>. It acts as an intermediary, connecting numerous suppliers with diverse clients (oil companies, pipelines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Benefits from a "network effect" where a larger distributor attracts more suppliers, which in turn attracts more clients, creating a virtuous circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>. This model can generate high cash flow with relatively low capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality**: The main problem for DistributionNOW is its direct link to the cyclicality of the oil and gas sector. When oil prices are high, demand for its products increases; when prices collapse, investment in new wells and infrastructure decreases, severely impacting its profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:15">[01:22:15]</a>.
*   **Recent Performance**: In 2020, with low oil prices, the company lost money, but as oil rebounded, it returned to profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.
*   **Potential Rationale**: Burry's interest might be linked to his [[the_influence_of_inflation_on_investment_portfolios | inflationary vision]] for the economy, where higher oil prices would necessitate more capital expenditures in the sector, benefiting DistributionNOW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. Historically, at $100 oil, the company earned around $100 million, which at its current enterprise value of $600 million, implies a cheap 6x earnings multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:40">[01:24:40]</a>.

## Key Takeaways for Investors
*   **Understand Business Value**: Investing successfully requires understanding a business's intrinsic value and how it generates profits, rather than relying on short-term market fluctuations or news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Cyclicality**: Assess how a company performs in different economic environments (e.g., recessions, boom periods) to understand its resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective**: Focus on the long-term potential for profit generation and intrinsic value growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>. Volatility, while challenging, creates opportunities for patient investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:25">[01:35:25]</a>.
*   **Avoid Psychological Biases**: Do not let past performance or market euphoria/panic dictate decisions. Human emotions of greed, euphoria, and fear often lead to predictable patterns in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Develop strong analytical skills, learn to calculate intrinsic value, and understand how to monitor investments over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:50">[01:13:50]</a>. This training is essential to avoid being a "stock market tourist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:40">[02:41:40]</a>.

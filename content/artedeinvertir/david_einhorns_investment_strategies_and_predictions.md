David Einhorn is one of Wall Street's most respected investors, known for average annual returns exceeding 15% per year [00:00:07]. He rose to fame by predicting and profiting from the fall of Lehman Brothers several months in advance, which contributed to one of the biggest financial crises of the last 40 years [00:00:11].

## Background and Career

Einhorn has accumulated a personal wealth of over a billion dollars by investing his own money and that of his clients [00:01:02]. He started from scratch in 1996, founding his first investment fund, Greenlight Capital, at just 28 years old [00:01:10]. The fund began with a small capital of $800,000, provided by investors who recognized his investment ability [00:01:16]. After several years of strong results, Greenlight Capital grew from managing $1 million to over $12 billion [00:01:28].

Einhorn is also an expert poker player, having participated multiple times in the World Series of Poker held annually in Las Vegas [00:01:35]. In 2006, he finished 28th out of over 10,000 participants in this tournament, donating his prize of over $650,000 to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research [00:01:46]. (The transcript mentions Alzheimer's, but the Michael J. Fox Foundation is for Parkinson's, a common transcription error. Sticking to transcript: "fight against Alzheimer's" [00:01:59]).

## Investment Philosophy: Long-Short Strategy

Einhorn is known as a "long-short" investor [00:02:00]. This strategy involves investing long-term in stocks considered undervalued or with good prospects, while simultaneously investing against (shorting) stocks believed to be overvalued or having poor prospects [00:02:02]. This approach aims to produce satisfactory results in any market environment, as short investments can support the portfolio's overall performance even in bear markets [00:02:14].

## Notable Successes and Warnings

Einhorn is characterized by typically moderate statements about the market [00:02:30]. However, he has a history of significant and accurate warnings:

*   **Lehman Brothers**: In April 2008, five months before its bankruptcy, Einhorn publicly warned at an investor conference that Lehman Brothers was manipulating its accounts and posed an enormous risk to the financial system [00:02:53]. His analysis led his fund to position itself to benefit from the bank's fall, resulting in high profits for him and his clients [00:03:14]. The financial director of Lehman Brothers even publicly called Einhorn a liar when he revealed his investigations [00:03:27].
*   **Allied Capital**: He made significant profits by exposing the fraud case of Allied Capital [00:03:38].
*   **Wirecard**: More recently, he alerted investors about the Wirecard case, a German technology company that lost over 95% of its stock market value due to another fraud scandal [00:03:41].
*   **Navigating Bubbles**: Einhorn is also considered a very conservative investor, which has helped him successfully navigate previous market bubbles, such as those in 2000 and 2007 [00:03:52].

## Current Market Predictions

In a recent letter to his investors, Einhorn explained why he is investing against the broader market and specific stocks [00:04:01]. This time, he has given an exact date for a market shift, which is unusual for him [00:04:51].

He states:
> "We are in the middle of a huge technological bubble. Our working hypothesis tells us that September 2nd, 2020, marked the market ceiling and that the bubble has already begun to deflate. Investor sentiment is changing from greed to complacency. We have adjusted our portfolio according to this hypothesis, adding short positions in many low-quality stocks that are trading at very high valuations." [00:04:23]

The Nasdaq index, which Einhorn considers highly overvalued, reached highs around 12,500 on September 2nd, 2020, and has not touched that level again since [00:05:03].

### Symptoms of the Bubble

Einhorn identifies several reasons for believing the market is currently in a large technological bubble:

1.  **High Number of IPOs**: Historically correlated with market cycle changes, there is a high investor appetite for new technology companies, with revaluations of over 200% on the first day of IPO being not unusual [00:05:35].
2.  **High Number of Unprofitable Listed Companies**: An "impressive" 80% of companies currently listed on the stock market are not making profits, surpassing the record set during the tech bubble of 2000 [00:05:58].
3.  **High Degree of Speculation**: An example cited is Hertz, the car rental company that went bankrupt [00:06:15]. After announcing bankruptcy and dropping to $1 per share, speculative fever propelled its shares to $5, even higher than its price before the bankruptcy announcement [00:06:31]. The American regulator (SEC) had to intervene to prevent the company from selling worthless shares [00:06:49]. In a normal market, a bankrupt company's stock would drop and stay low [00:06:59]. However, after Hertz announced bankruptcy, the number of investors holding its shares on one famous US brokerage tripled from 40,000 to over 140,000 [00:07:18].
4.  **Stock Performance After Splits**: Popular shares show great performance immediately after announcing a stock split [00:07:33]. While a split (e.g., 2-for-1) is neutral for an investor's value, [[david_einhorns_short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] shares revalued by over 50% and Apple shares by over 30% after announcing splits, which Einhorn considers abnormal in a rational market [00:07:42].

## Specific Investment Positions

### Short Positions

Einhorn has invested against certain stocks, including some very famous names.

*   **[[david_einhorns_short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Amazon]] (AMZN)**:
    *   Einhorn views Amazon as a great company, but believes its current valuation of $3,200 per share is excessive due to its recent rise [00:08:45].
    *   Amazon's sales grew by 37%, and its operating cash flow grew by over 56%, demonstrating "operating leverage" where profit grows faster than sales [00:09:01].
    *   Using the EV/EBITDA ratio, the historical average valuation of Amazon over the last five years is around 26 times EBITDA [00:09:18].
    *   Estimating Amazon could earn over $54 billion in EBITDA in 2020, growing to over $100 billion in the next three years, a valuation at its historical average would reach $5,200 per share [00:09:37]. This is an interesting potential price but lower than its listed price at the time of the analysis [00:09:55].
*   **[[david_einhorns_short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] (TSLA)**:
    *   Einhorn has invested against Tesla to benefit from a possible stock market drop [00:12:52].
    *   He and Elon Musk have engaged in "epic battles" [00:12:57]. Musk has publicly ridiculed Einhorn due to Tesla's continuous rise, causing losses to Greenlight Capital from its bearish position [00:13:02].
    *   Einhorn has publicly accused Tesla of manipulating its accounts to artificially inflate profits and playing with investor expectations [00:13:16].
    *   In a Q2 2020 letter, he cited that Musk participated in an "alarming manipulation scandal" for which the SEC imposed an "insignificant amount of money" [00:13:27].
    *   Einhorn claims Tesla artificially increases income with "sales of cars that do not exist" and takes advantage of future tax credits to boost current reported profit [00:13:47].
    *   Tesla is expected to earn $3 per share in 2021, trading at a valuation of over 140 times earnings [00:14:12]. Einhorn advises that investing in such situations requires deep understanding of the investment to determine if earnings can drastically increase in the future; otherwise, it's better to stay out [00:14:21].

### Optimistic Investments

Einhorn is optimistic about the future of certain companies and sectors.

*   **VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX)**:
    *   Einhorn bought over $67 million in shares of this ETF in the last quarter to benefit from a possible rise in gold [00:10:36].
    *   He notes that both Democratic and Republican parties share a "fondness for printing money," with over $3.3 trillion printed in 2020 alone, representing 22% of all dollars in circulation in 2019 [00:11:15].
    *   Einhorn deduces that the behavior of gold is directly linked to central banks printing money, which ultimately generates inflation and is positive for gold's performance [00:11:38].
    *   This gold ETF has appreciated over 50% in the last 12 months due to the large amounts of money being printed globally to combat the crisis [00:11:53]. While valuing such speculative instruments is complicated, Einhorn believes if central governments continue printing money, inflation will rise, and gold will perform well [00:12:04].
*   **Green Brick Partners (GRBK)**:
    *   Einhorn has invested an "impressive" 31% of his portfolio in Green Brick Partners, totaling over $280 million, controlling 48% of shares in circulation [00:15:05].
    *   This company builds residential homes in the Atlanta and Texas regions, two of the fastest-growing areas in the U.S. [00:15:35].
    *   Low interest rates and the current global situation (leading to increased demand for housing outside urban centers) contribute to significant growth in the construction sector [00:15:42]. Green Brick is well-capitalized to capture this growth [00:15:51].
    *   The company's profit before taxes increased by over 100% compared to the same period in 2019 due to high demand [00:16:04]. Its profits have tripled over the last four years, and the stock is still reasonably priced [00:16:19].
    *   Compared to competitors, Green Brick shows the greatest growth, highest profit margins, and least debt [00:16:28].
    *   Estimating future earnings at $3 per share in the next two years, and applying a historical P/E ratio of 12 for homebuilders, suggests a valuation of $36 per share [00:17:01]. This represents a "very interesting potential realization" compared to its current trading price of $21 [00:17:26].

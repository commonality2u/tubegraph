The [[World Economic Forum]] (WEF) is the organization behind "The Great Economic Reset" movement, an economic scenario that is expected to affect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This new economic reform has the support of powerful individuals globally, including heads of government and prominent businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## About the World Economic Forum
[[Klaus Schwab]] is the founder of the [[World Economic Forum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The organization is supposedly a non-profit NGO and includes some of the world's most influential people among its ranks, such as heads of government and major businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

Notable members of the [[World Economic Forum]] include:
*   President of China, Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>
*   Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>
*   Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>
*   [[Bill Gates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
*   George Soros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>

The most visible part of this organization is the annual Davos [[World Economic Forum]] event, which takes place each January in a small town in the Swiss Alps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Access to this exclusive event can cost between $13,000 and $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The Davos Forum 2021 was held to launch this new "Great Economic Reset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

## The Great Economic Reset
The "Great Economic Reset" arises from the "current crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, proposing a total transformation of society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. [[Klaus Schwab]] has published a book outlining his future plans for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The term "great economic reset" often leads to speculation and conspiracy theories due to its vague public definition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. While these reforms are presented as idyllic and beneficial, some aspects may not be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The reforms fundamentally focus on three areas: social, economic, and environmental, with economic measures being central within a capitalist system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Key Reforms and Their Economic Impact

#### 1. Increase in Taxes
One of the first proposals of the "Great Economic Reset" is a tax increase for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is mainly due to:
*   Governments becoming highly indebted after the current crisis, requiring more taxes to repay debts issued to support the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   Governments raising money to boost sectors recommended by the [[World Economic Forum]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

This tax increase mechanism appears to be underway in the United States, where Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve president, is set to become the Secretary of the Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Joe Biden, a follower of the [[World Economic Forum]], has an economic plan that includes many of these recommended reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Janet Yellen has stated:
> "The recovery plan will prioritize raising taxes on the wealthy since both benefited from the Republican tax cuts of 2017 and now they must pay their fair share." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

She also proposed taxing unrealized profits in the stock market, which would discourage investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts led to accelerated profits for S&P 500 companies between 2016 and 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Reversing these cuts could lead to a 15-20% drop in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

#### 2. Environmental Focus and Carbon Emissions
The "Great Economic Reset" promotes a "zero emissions balance," leading to:
*   Tremendous aid for the renewable and clean energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.
*   New taxes to discourage highly polluting energies and raise money for cleaner alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The Davos 2021 forum agenda is heavily focused on renewable energies and carbon emissions, with guests including [[Bill Gates]] and Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Joe Biden's Democratic government has pledged over $2 trillion in aid to the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This plan also discourages investment in highly polluting energies like oil and coal, which have performed poorly in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

Investment opportunities in this area include:
*   **Electric Cars**: Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
*   **Wind Generation**: Gamesa, Siemens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   **Solar Energy**: Jinko Solar, Canadian Solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>
*   **ETFs**: Nasdaq Clean Energy (CELS) and Eye Search Global Clean Energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

#### 3. Fourth Industrial Revolution (New Technologies)
This reform aims to promote new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The Davos forum dedicates an entire day to this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The European Union's official website shows significant aid planned for innovation and technological development, totaling over 140 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

This focus benefits the Nasdaq and technology stocks, which have been top-performing sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Large American technology companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are among the most benefited, partly because a large portion of their taxes are declared abroad, reducing the negative impact of potential US tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Investment opportunities include:
*   **Qualcomm (QCOM)**: A leading microchip and processor manufacturer for smartphones with Snapdragon processors, holding over 140,000 patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. It is well-positioned to benefit from the promotion of 5G technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Its shares are currently valued at around 20 times earnings, below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
*   **Equinix (EQIX)**: A real estate investment trust (REIT) that specializes in building and renting data centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. REITs have a special tax regime in the US where they don't pay corporate taxes if they distribute most profits as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. Equinix benefits tremendously from the "Fourth Industrial Revolution" as the amount of data processed and transported through the internet exponentially increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Its clients include Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>.

#### 4. Socially Committed Companies (ESG Criteria)
The "Great Economic Reset" promotes investment in companies that are socially committed, adhering to Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Historically, companies prioritized shareholders, but this new school of thought aims for all parties interacting with the company (social, environmental, and people) to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Companies meeting these criteria have shown exceptional performance in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

Companies in the S&P 500 that meet ESG requirements include Visa, United Health, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

## Controversial Elements and Economic Implications
### Event 201
One event that has generated significant distrust towards the [[World Economic Forum]] and the "Great Economic Reset" is the "Event 201" simulation, which occurred in October 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This simulation, involving government leaders, scientists, and large multinationals, coincidentally bore strong similarities to the current crisis experienced in 2020, leading to many conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

### Inflationary Measures
The measures proposed by the "Great Economic Reset" are inflationary because financing large investments requires printing new money and increasing government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In an inflationary environment, gold tends to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Notably, [[Ray Dalios new world economic order | Ray Dalio]], a regular member of the Davos forum and manager of the world's largest investment fund, holds significant amounts of gold in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

> [00:16:17] My personal advice in the face of this new situation of the desire for an economic start that overreacts to us is to think that due to new measures imposed by politicians the world always tends to be a better place and wealth is generated and one of the best ways to capitalize and benefit from this economic progress is through long-term investment in stocks and the stock market.

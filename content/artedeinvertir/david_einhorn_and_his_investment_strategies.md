David Einhorn, often regarded as one of Wall Street's most respected investors, has achieved average annual returns exceeding 15% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He gained prominence by accurately predicting and profiting from the fall of Lehman Brothers several months in advance, an event that contributed to a major financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Einhorn has recently revealed his predictions for the end of the current stock market bubble and how he plans to profit from it, focusing his bearish bets on popular stocks like Tesla and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He also holds optimistic views on several stocks in which he has recently invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Early Career and Investment Philosophy

Considered one of the most talented investors, David Einhorn has amassed a personal wealth exceeding a billion dollars by investing his own money and that of his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He started from scratch in 1996, founding his first investment fund, Greenlight Capital, at just 28 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. The fund began with a modest capital of $800,000, provided by a small group of investors who recognized his investing ability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. After several years of strong results, Greenlight Capital grew from managing $1 million to over $12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Einhorn is also an expert poker player and has participated multiple times in the World Series of Poker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In 2006, he finished 28th out of over 10,000 participants in the prestigious tournament, donating more than $650,000 of his winnings to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Parkinson's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

David Einhorn practices a "long-short" [[investment_strategies_of_professional_investors_like_david_tepper_and_bill_ackman | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This means he invests long-term in stocks he believes are undervalued or have better prospects, while simultaneously investing against (shorting) stocks he considers overvalued or to have worse prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This approach allows his portfolio to produce satisfactory results in any market environment, even in bear markets, as short positions can offset general portfolio behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Notable Successes and Warnings

Einhorn is known for his accurate market predictions, making his recent pronouncements particularly noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:08">[02:30:08]</a>.

### Predicting Lehman Brothers' Bankruptcy
In September 2008, Lehman Brothers went bankrupt, precipitating one of the most significant financial crises in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:15">[02:54:15]</a>. Five months prior, in April 2008, Einhorn warned investors at a conference that Lehman Brothers was manipulating its accounts and posed an "enormous risk" to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:03">[03:02:03]</a>. After his analysis, he positioned a significant portion of his fund to profit from the bank's collapse, yielding substantial returns for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:03">[03:14:03]</a>. The scandal was so prominent that Lehman's financial director publicly called Einhorn a "liar" when he revealed his findings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:47">[03:26:47]</a>.

### Other Successes
Einhorn's track record extends beyond Lehman Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:36">[03:35:36]</a>:
*   He made significant profits by exposing the Allied Capital fraud case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:29">[03:38:29]</a>.
*   More recently, he alerted investors to the Wirecard case, a German technology company that lost over 95% of its market value due to fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>.

Einhorn's conservative approach has also helped him navigate previous market bubbles, such as those in 2000 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:16">[03:52:16]</a>.

## Current Market Outlook and Short Positions

In a recent letter to his investors, Einhorn explained his current strategy of investing against the market and certain specific stocks, including very famous names like Tesla and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

### Prediction of a "Technological Bubble"
Einhorn states, "We are in the middle of a huge technological bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:23:41">[04:23:41]</a>. His working hypothesis is that September 2nd, 2020, marked the market ceiling, and the bubble has already begun to deflate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:03">[04:27:03]</a>. He notes a shift in investor sentiment from greed to complacency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:09">[04:38:09]</a>. His portfolio has been adjusted accordingly, adding short positions in many "low quality stocks" trading at "very high valuations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:09">[04:41:09]</a>. It is unusual for Einhorn, who has been investing for 25 years, to give such an exact date for a market cycle change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>. The Nasdaq index, which Einhorn considers highly overvalued, reached highs around 12,500 on September 2nd, 2020, and has not touched that level since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:44">[05:02:44]</a>.

### Reasons for the Bubble Assessment
Einhorn identifies several symptoms indicating a large technological bubble:
1.  **High Number of IPOs:** Historically correlated with market cycle changes, a high appetite for new tech company IPOs is observed, with revaluations of over 200% on the first day not uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:10">[05:35:10]</a>.
2.  **High Number of Unprofitable Listed Companies:** An "impressive 80%" of listed companies are currently unprofitable, surpassing the record set during the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:20">[05:58:20]</a>.
3.  **High Degree of Speculation:** As an example, Einhorn points to Hertz, the car rental company that went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:04">[06:14:04]</a>. Despite its bankruptcy, Hertz shares surged in a speculative frenzy, even reaching levels higher than before its bankruptcy announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:19">[06:30:19]</a>. The SEC had to intervene to prevent the company from selling worthless shares to eager investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:09">[06:49:09]</a>. In a normal market, bankrupt companies' share prices drop and remain low; however, in the current environment, investors are "lining up to buy shares of companies that are bankrupt" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:17">[06:59:17]</a>. Over 140,000 investors held Hertz shares after its bankruptcy announcement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:03">[07:18:03]</a>.
4.  **Popular Stocks Performing Well After Splits:** Einhorn notes that stocks like Tesla and Apple saw significant revaluation (over 50% for Tesla, over 30% for Apple) after announcing stock splits, even though splits do not add intrinsic value to a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:01">[07:33:01]</a>. This behavior, he argues, would not be typical in a rational market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:05">[08:09:05]</a>.

### Short Position: Amazon (AMZN)
Amazon is one of the stocks Einhorn has invested against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:16:08">[08:16:08]</a>. While he acknowledges Amazon as a "great company," he believes its current stock market valuation of $3,200 per share is "excessive" due to its recent rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:11">[08:45:11]</a>. Amazon's sales have grown by 37%, and its operating cash flow by over 56%, demonstrating "operating leverage" that allows profits to grow faster than sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:26">[09:00:26]</a>. Einhorn values technology companies like Amazon using EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:09">[09:17:09]</a>. Amazon's historical average EV/EBITDA over the last five years is around 26 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. Based on an estimated $100 billion in EBITDA in the next three years, valuing it at its historical average would give a target price of $5,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:03">[09:44:03]</a>.

### Short Position: Tesla (TSLA)
Einhorn has also invested against Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:17">[12:44:17]</a>. There has been a notable public conflict between Einhorn and Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:06">[12:56:06]</a>. Musk has publicly ridiculed Einhorn due to Tesla's continued stock rise, causing significant losses for Greenlight Capital from its long-held bearish position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:02:08">[13:02:08]</a>. Conversely, Einhorn has publicly accused Tesla of manipulating its accounts to artificially inflate profits and playing with investor expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:06">[13:15:06]</a>. In a letter from Q2 2020, Einhorn explained that Musk participated in an "alarming manipulation scandal" and that Tesla is artificially increasing its income through "sales of cars that do not exist" and by leveraging future tax credits to boost current reported profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:04">[13:33:04]</a>.

Tesla's valuation is seen as extremely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:18">[14:04:18]</a>. With an estimated $3 in earnings per share for 2021, its current trading price of $420 per share implies a valuation of over 140 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. Einhorn advises that investing in such situations with demanding valuations requires a deep understanding of the company's ability to drastically increase future earnings; otherwise, it's safer to avoid such investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:04">[14:22:04]</a>. Investing against an overvalued stock can be very dangerous, as Einhorn has experienced with Tesla over the past five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

## Optimistic Investments

### VanEck Vectors Gold Miners ETF (GDX)
Einhorn bought over $67 million in shares of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) in the last quarter, aiming to benefit from a potential rise in gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:46:08">[10:46:08]</a>. In his letter, he notes that both Democratic and Republican parties share a "fondness for printing money," with over $3.3 trillion printed in 2020 alone, representing 22% of all dollars in circulation in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:23">[11:15:23]</a>. He concludes that the behavior of gold is directly linked to the printing of money by central banks, as this generates inflation, which is positive for gold's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a>. The GDX ETF has appreciated over 50% in the last 12 months due to global money printing to combat the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:16">[11:52:16]</a>. While valuing such ETFs is complex, Einhorn believes that continued money printing by central governments will lead to rising inflation and strong gold performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:18">[12:04:18]</a>.

### Green Brick Partners (GRBK)
Einhorn has invested an impressive 31% of his portfolio, over $280 million, in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), a residential homebuilding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:36">[15:04:36]</a>. Greenlight Capital controls 48% of the company's shares in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:14">[15:18:14]</a>. Green Brick Partners focuses on building homes in the Atlanta and Texas regions, two of the fastest-growing areas in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:04">[15:34:04]</a>. The entire construction sector is experiencing significant growth due to low interest rates set by central banks, and Green Brick is well-capitalized to capture this growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:42:04">[15:42:04]</a>. Additionally, demand for housing outside urban centers is increasing dramatically, a niche in which Green Brick operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:23">[15:53:23]</a>.

Green Brick's profit before taxes has increased by over 100% compared to 2019, driven by high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:13">[16:04:13]</a>. The company has tripled its profits over the last four years and still trades at a reasonable valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:18:04">[16:18:04]</a>. Compared to competitors, Green Brick exhibits the greatest growth, highest profit margins, and lowest debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>.

For valuation, it is estimated that Green Brick Partners could earn $3 in earnings per share in the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:59:08">[16:59:08]</a>. Historically, homebuilders have traded at a P/E ratio of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:07">[17:05:07]</a>. Multiplying the projected $3 earnings per share by a 12 P/E ratio yields a future valuation of $36, which represents a very interesting potential gain compared to its current trading price of $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:06">[17:16:06]</a>. This potential appreciation is likely a primary reason for Einhorn's significant investment in Green Brick Partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:30:08">[17:30:08]</a>.

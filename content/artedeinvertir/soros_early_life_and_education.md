[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | George Soros]] is known for his unique approach to investing, particularly his [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]], which has been a significant factor in generating a large part of his wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. His investment results have been described as "spectacular" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>; since founding his fund in 1970, he has achieved average annual returns of 25% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. Notably, he experienced no major losses during significant market downturns such as those in 1987, 1990, the dot-com bubble, 2008, and 2011, often emerging strengthened from these [[historical_financial_crises_and_soros_performance | crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Background and Escape

George Soros was initially a Hungarian refugee during World War II, following the Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His parents, who were described as middle-class at the time, managed to falsify papers, allowing him to travel to the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Education and Philosophical Roots

Due to his family's income, which placed them in the upper-middle class, Soros was able to gain admission to the London Business School <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. This institution was powerful and provided excellent credentials at the time, and remains highly respected today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Soros himself states that his true passion lies in philosophy, not investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. One of his mentors was Karl Popper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It was through this philosophical influence that he endeavored to merge philosophy with investment, leading to the development of his [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Early Career Challenges

After graduating from the London Business School, Soros faced significant difficulties finding employment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He encountered a deeply racist or xenophobic society, which made securing a job very challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. Consequently, he took on jobs that did not align with his qualifications, including selling vacuum cleaners or other gadgets door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

He eventually met another Hungarian middle manager at a financial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Through this contact, Soros was able to enter the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Style

Many people are unaware that Soros began his career as a value investor, focusing on "cheap stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, over the years, his [[the_evolution_of_soros_investment_philosophy | investment philosophy evolved]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>, and he modified his style to pursue greater profit opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

While working at a financial institution, Soros gained a reputation for identifying undervalued German stocks in the 1950s and 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Germany at that time presented a growth environment with cheap stocks, particularly those with dual structures (common and preferred shares), a situation comparable to Korean preferred stocks today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He prepared reports for his clients explaining the market situation and opportunities, achieving good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. These new clients provided the support needed for him to establish his own company with just $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

His fund, later known as the Quantum Fund, grew to manage assets exceeding $30 billion to $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Most of this growth was organic, as Soros eventually stopped accepting external clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This demonstrates the power of compound interest, with 25% annual returns over 40 years transforming a tiny initial capital into immense wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

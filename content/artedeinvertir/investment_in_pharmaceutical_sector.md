Warren Buffett, often called "the oracle of Omaha" for his investment acumen, has shown renewed confidence in the market, making significant share purchases, including a more than $9 billion acquisition [00:01:13]. After months of caution, he has made substantial investments in the pharmaceutical sector [00:00:09]. His portfolio of listed shares is valued at over $240 million [00:00:05].

## Warren Buffett's Investment Approach

Warren Buffett's investment strategy involves waiting for good companies with predictable and increasing income to trade at an attractive valuation [00:03:52]. This often occurs due to temporary, solvable problems or when the market overlooks such investments in favor of fashionable alternatives [00:04:00]. This approach has allowed him to generate annual returns exceeding 20 percent [00:01:25].

### Why the Pharmaceutical Sector?

The pharmaceutical sector has historically traded at high valuations because it consists of excellent businesses with strong long-term prospects, partly due to the aging global population [00:04:10]. However, from 2016 onward, the sector faced pressure due to threats of new regulations and limitations on profit margins from the Trump administration [00:04:21]. With the change to a new democratic administration, which plans to invest heavily in healthcare, this threat has dissipated [00:04:37].

This shift has left behind great businesses that are highly resilient to economic crises, including the 2020 crisis, with profits that have doubled over the last five years and strong future growth prospects [00:04:44]. The most compelling factor for Buffett is the attractive valuation, which has not been seen for decades in this class of shares [00:05:04].

## Key Pharmaceutical Investments

Warren Buffett's recent investments have focused primarily on pharmaceutical companies such as Bristol Myers, Merck, and AbbVie [00:03:18].

### Bristol Myers (BM)

Bristol Myers (ticker: BM), listed at $61 per share, saw Warren Buffett invest an impressive $1.8 billion [00:05:13].
*   **Market Position**: The company holds an excellent market position in oncology and cardiovascular problems [00:05:27]. Its competitive advantage has led to its shares multiplying by over 30 times in the last 30 years [00:05:31].
*   **Resilience**: Bristol Myers is highly resistant to economic crises. It confirmed a 6% growth in 2020 compared to 2019 [00:05:40]. The company also provided a profit forecast of over $7 per share for 2021, demonstrating high visibility for the future [00:05:58].
*   **Valuation**: Historically, the pharmaceutical sector has traded at 20 times earnings. Valuing Bristol Myers conservatively at 15 times its estimated $7 per share earnings for 2021 suggests a target price of over $100 [00:06:22]. This represents a potential appreciation of over 60 percent in just one year [00:06:42]. Over the next five years, its value could triple, reaching between $150 and $200 per share due to expected sector growth [00:06:47].

### AbbVie (ABBV)

AbbVie (ticker: ABBV), listed at $100 per share, received an investment of over $1 billion from Warren Buffett [00:07:00].
*   **Leadership**: AbbVie holds a leadership position within the pharmaceutical sector [00:07:12].
*   **Performance**: The company has a strong track record of generating value and has performed well for shareholders [00:07:16]. Like Bristol Myers, the 2020 crisis did not affect it, and its profits are expected to increase compared to 2019 [00:07:24].
*   **Financials**:
    *   **Income**: Its income has increased significantly, from $25 billion to over $50 billion in the last five years [00:07:44].
    *   **Profit Margins**: AbbVie boasts operating profit margins of over 40 percent on sales, which is exceptionally high, even surpassing Coca-Cola's 20 percent margins [00:07:53].
    *   **Earnings Per Share**: Earnings per share have risen from $4.80 to over $12 for 2021 [00:08:17].
*   **Valuation**: Conservatively valuing AbbVie at 15 times its expected 2021 earnings of over $12 per share, it could reach a value of $180 per share in one year [00:08:52]. Its shares are currently trading at $100 [00:09:08]. In five years, the intrinsic value of the shares could exceed $300 per share [00:09:10].

These investments reflect Warren Buffett's consistent strategy of identifying high-quality businesses that are temporarily undervalued, providing significant potential for future returns.

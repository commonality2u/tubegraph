Warren Buffett made his first major [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] of 2020 by investing $10 billion in the energy sector, specifically acquiring [[Dominion Energy and natural gas transportation | Dominion Energy's]] natural gas transportation assets, including $6 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This strategic move highlights a sector with interesting future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Why Invest in the Energy Sector?

The energy sector, particularly natural gas, is currently one of the least appreciated by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. This widespread market fear results in attractive valuations for companies within the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Historically, periods of low market sentiment in the energy sector, such as the 1970s or early 2000s, have presented attractive [[investment opportunities during inflation | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. For example, Warren Buffett's $500 million investment in Petrochina in 2002, when the energy sector indicator was at its lowest, multiplied eightfold in less than five years, reaching $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Types of Natural Gas Investments

### Natural Gas Producers/Extractors (Cons)

Investing directly in natural gas producers or extractors comes with significant challenges:
*   **High Fixed Costs** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.
*   **Lack of Price Control**: They do not control the sale price of natural gas, which depends on its exchange listing, leading to unpredictable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Volatility**: This lack of predictability often prevents them from prospering consistently in the stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Companies (Pros)

Warren Buffett's recent investment specifically targeted natural gas transportation assets, which he considers a much safer way to invest in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. These companies offer distinct advantages:
*   **Fixed Revenue Streams**: They charge clients a fixed rate for using pipelines or based on volume transported, irrespective of the gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Local Monopolies**: Once a main transportation line is established, governments rarely grant a second license for competition, creating monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.
*   **High Dividends**: These companies typically pay high dividends to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Resilient Demand**: Energy consumption, including natural gas, is highly resilient, even during crises, as it is an essential good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.
*   **Insulated from Price Swings**: Unlike producers, transportation companies are largely insulated from natural gas price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. For example, only 2% of Kinder Morgan's contracts depend on gas price, with the rest being fixed-rate or volume-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## Growth Prospects for Natural Gas

Warren Buffett's interest in natural gas is driven by two key reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:
1.  **US Export Potential**: Due to technologies like fracking and shale gas, the U.S. has become the world's largest natural gas producer, producing more than it consumes domestically. This necessitates gas transportation lines for export to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.
2.  **Cleaner Energy Transition**: Natural gas is a cheaper and cleaner energy source compared to coal or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. It is projected to be one of the fastest-growing energies over the next 20 years, aiding the transition to more environmentally friendly energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)

Kinder Morgan (KMI), trading at $14 per share, is the largest natural gas transportation company in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Despite recent gas price drops, its contracts are largely volume-based or fixed-rate, making it resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. The company confirmed profits would only fall by a modest 6% due to lower consumption during confinement, not gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Its profits for 2020 are projected to be $4.6 billion, consistent with 2014, yet shares are down from $40 to $14 due to market sentiment shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>. Kinder Morgan is expected to earn $2 per share and distribute $1 as a dividend, resulting in a 7% annual dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.

### Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP)

Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP), trading at $33 per share, specializes in natural gas storage and export assets in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. Obtaining licenses for these export terminals is extremely difficult, fostering monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. Global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to increase, making CQP a key beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. The company has 80.5% of its contracts at fixed rates with an average duration of 19 years, providing tremendous stability and income visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. Its profits are projected to increase by 5-10% this year, and it offers an annual dividend yield of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

## Market Euphoria and Valuation Risks (Cons)

While specific sectors offer opportunities, market euphoria can lead to irrational valuations. For example, the excitement around electric vehicle companies or cryptocurrencies has led to inflated valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Companies like Nio, often called "the Tesla of China," saw shares multiply tenfold in less than nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

Fisker, an electric vehicle company that went bankrupt in 2016 due to operating losses and poor product quality, is being taken public again at an "astronomical valuation of $4 billion" by financiers leveraging investor appetite for such companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Nio's $15 billion valuation, despite selling only 20,000 vehicles and losing $1.6 billion, is comparable to Fiat Chrysler, which sells over a million cars and has $100 billion in sales with $6 billion in annual profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

Similarly, Mercado Libre (ML), often called the "Amazon of Latin America," has seen tremendous growth in turnover, from $600 million to an expected $3 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. However, it also experienced losses of $170 million in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Mercado Libre's current valuation of $48 billion is double Amazon's valuation of $24 billion during the dot-com bubble, when Amazon had similar revenue and losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. After that bubble, Amazon shares dropped 80%, and shareholders took eight years to recover their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

> [!WARNING]
> It's important to remember that a good company does not necessarily equate to a good [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] if its valuation doesn't make sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Conversely, companies that are not exceptionally good but are listed at attractive valuations can become good [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While short-term stock market evolution is less affected by valuation, it is a determining factor in the long term, along with business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Investors must make informed decisions and not be swayed by emotions or market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

The current global economic scenario is poised to affect everyone, regardless of investment activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. The clock is counting down, and an [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | economic disaster]] may be approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Janet Yellen has warned that this situation could lead to the [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | total collapse of the financial system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. If a solution isn't found within weeks, it could cause [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | irreversible damage to the American economy and to global stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Who is Janet Yellen?

Janet Yellen is the current director of the American Treasury <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a> and previously served as the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The Federal Reserve manages over four trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Her extensive knowledge of the economy and financial markets has led her to these significant positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>, making her opinion on this new risk vitally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## The Problem of the US Debt Ceiling

Yellen views the arbitrary setting of a [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt ceiling]] and the creation of periodic or self-manufactured crises that risk the stability of the financial and economic system as "tremendously irresponsible," especially during a recovery from a deep crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

The United States, like most countries, consistently spends more money than it earns, leading to a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>. To finance this spending, new [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]] is issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Many years ago, a limit was established on how much the US could go into [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]], and this limit is now about to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Extraordinary Measures Taken

Given that the [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | United States is at the limit of the debt it can issue]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>, Yellen has initiated desperate measures. These include significant cuts to investments in pension and health plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> and the suspension of government investments for employee retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. These measures amount to a spending cut of over 200 billion US dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>.

### Market Reaction and Risk Assessment

Financial markets are already pricing in a potential bankruptcy of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDS), which are insurance against government debt default, have seen their price to insure American government debt multiply by more than nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This indicates that financial markets perceive an enormous risk of the US defaulting on its [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

The US [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]] bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:00">[04:24:00]</a>. The total US [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]] has grown exponentially to 30 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. A default would cause a [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | financial collapse]] and total chaos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>, similar to the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, but multiplied by 30 times due to the sheer size of the current US [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

## Potential Consequences of a Default

If a default on American debt occurs:
*   The value of dollar bonds and fixed income would collapse due to loss of investor confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   Stocks and equity investments would fall sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   The White House estimates that a default would mean more than 2 million job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   It would incur an additional cost for the United States of over 750 billion dollars annually in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   The dollar and the stock market would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. The White House projects stock market drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

### Potential Safe Havens and Beneficiaries

In such a scenario, some [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_a_debt_crisis | investments]] might benefit:
*   **Gold**: Its price would likely rise sharply, as it is measured against the American dollar, providing a safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Gold-related stocks**: Mining or gold royalty companies would benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs**: These funds are designed to increase in value when the market goes down, by betting against the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. The ProShares Short S&P500 (SH) is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. However, these instruments have historically performed poorly in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.
*   Some investors are adopting measures to bet against the US government [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt]] and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.

## "Comical" Proposed Solutions

One of the most viable solutions, an agreement between Republicans and Democrats, is hindered by political divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
Proposed [[controversial_solutions_to_the_us_debt_problem | solutions]] have become desperate, including minting a "trillion dollar platinum coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. This seems like something out of a Hollywood movie but is possible due to a legal loophole in American law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. While the Federal Reserve is the only entity that can print money digitally out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:00">[07:28:00]</a>, American law allows the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Such coins, with a nominal value of one trillion dollars, would be deposited with the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to continue paying expenses without going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

This solution, while potentially working in the short term, would not send a message of stability to financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>, and the value of the dollar, bonds, and stocks would likely continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### Yellen's Deadline Warning

Yellen has warned that the extraordinary measures taken by the Treasury will likely be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. This indicates that the current solutions are only temporary, and the [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | collapse of the American debt]] could be just weeks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>.

> In the statement that she has sent individually, the American Treasury cannot provide an estimate of how much extra time we have after the extraordinary measures that we have had to adopt. It is likely that these measures will be exhausted before the first week of June.

Historically, when the [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt limit]] scenario was reached in 2011 and 2013, markets experienced high volatility even with temporary solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

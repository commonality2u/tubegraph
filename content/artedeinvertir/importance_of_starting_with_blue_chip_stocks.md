When beginning to [[starting_to_invest_in_the_stock_market | invest in the stock market]], it is highly recommended to start with blue chip stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. This approach helps new investors gain confidence and mitigate the impact of early mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>.

## What Are Blue Chip Stocks?
Blue chip stocks typically refer to large capitalization companies of significant size and good quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:20:00">[13:20:00]</a>. Examples include well-known corporations like IBM or McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:26:00">[13:26:00]</a>. While there are large companies that may not be of good quality or can be highly volatile (like Renault) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>, blue chips specifically emphasize both size and stability.

## Why Start with Blue Chips?

### Gaining Confidence and Minimizing Mistakes
Investing in blue chips at the outset allows new investors to gain confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>. These companies are generally more stable, meaning investors are less likely to "pay so dearly for mistakes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. This contrasts with more volatile or less established companies, where losses can be more significant for a beginner.

### Isolating from Economic Noise
Starting with blue chips also helps investors "isolate completely from the economic news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>. Fluctuations based on external events (e.g., political situations) may not have as much of an effect on these stable companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>. This allows beginners to focus on learning rather than reacting to short-term market noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:13:00">[14:13:00]</a>.

### Fostering a "Virtuous Circle"
The initial results obtained when taking action are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:29:00">[19:29:00]</a>. If positive results are achieved, a "virtuous circle" is generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:37:00">[19:37:00]</a>. This positive reinforcement leads to:
*   Belief in the investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:00">[19:43:00]</a>.
*   Feeling capable and strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.
*   Increased motivation to acquire more resources and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:07:00">[20:07:00]</a>.
*   More effective action based on good resources, leading to even better results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:13:00">[20:13:00]</a>.

Conversely, if one does not prepare enough and fails miserably at the start, it can introduce negative ideas into the brain, making the individual believe that investing is not for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>. Starting with stable blue chips helps prevent this "vicious circle" of initial failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:09:00">[21:09:00]</a>.

### Managing Learning Stages
Investing is a journey with different learning stages. At the beginning, knowledge acquisition can be rapid, but it tends to stagnate at a certain point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:06:00">[22:06:00]</a>.
*   **The Doubtful**: Tend to give up when they feel they are not advancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:27:00">[22:27:00]</a>.
*   **The Aggressive Student**: Pushes through stagnation with enormous effort but may lack clear direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>.
*   **The Expert**: Anticipates difficulties and prepares for stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. Learning from the mistakes of others saves time and resources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

Starting with blue chips helps ensure positive early results, which is critical for transitioning smoothly through these learning stages and progressing in one's investment career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:08:00">[25:08:00]</a>. It allows investors to build foundational knowledge before moving on to more complex companies that require deeper [[understanding_companies_before_investing | analytical work]] or offer higher potential returns, such as [[advantages_of_investing_in_small_companies | smaller companies]] or [[role_of_small_and_lesserknown_stocks_in_investment_portfolios | smaller stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:00">[24:43:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE]
> The speaker mentions that a portfolio of 40 securities may be a good starting point using this technique <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. While this won't generate annual returns of 25-30% like experienced investors, it's a solid start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. For people with [[investing_with_little_money_in_the_stock_market | little money]], investment funds can be a good alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.

Ultimately, starting with blue chip stocks provides a safer and more constructive environment for new investors to learn, gain confidence, and build a positive foundation for their investment journey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:52:00">[13:52:00]</a>.

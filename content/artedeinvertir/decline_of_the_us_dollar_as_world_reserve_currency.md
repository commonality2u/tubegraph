From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

The US dollar, long considered the world's most important currency, has begun its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. An alliance led by China and the BRICS countries aims to end the dollar's dominance as a world reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This significant shift is expected to affect currency values, savings, investments, inflation levels, and even the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Renowned investors like Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmiller have warned about the dollar's future loss of value and have begun selling their dollar holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Current Role of the US Dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>

The dollar's status as the world's most important currency grants the United States significant privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This status affects all other currencies linked to the dollar, meaning its decline would impact everyone, regardless of whether they hold dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. China recognizes the immense power that comes with having the world's leading currency and seeks to end this status to achieve its goal of becoming the greatest economic power globally in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>.

### Why is Reserve Currency Status Important? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>

The privilege of owning the world's reserve currency offers two main advantages:

1.  **Printing Money Without High Inflation**: The United States can print large quantities of new dollars without generating significant inflation due to constant international demand for the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>. Currency value is determined by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. For the past 50 years, the US has solved economic problems by simply printing more dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. For instance, 23% of all dollars in circulation were printed in a single year to address the 2020 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. While there has been recent inflation, it pales in comparison to what other countries experienced when resorting to printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. For example, Argentina's central bank balance sheet grew 80% from 2017-2018, leading to 60% annual inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. In contrast, the Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew over 120% in less than 1.5 years during the 2020 crisis, with current inflation at only 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:00">[04:28:00]</a>. This ability explains why the US has prospered after crises while countries like Brazil, Argentina, or even China have been harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>.

2.  **Lower Interest Rates for Financing**: The dollar's status allows the US and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This provides a competitive advantage for their economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>, as investors are reluctant to lend money to countries with weak currencies that may depreciate or lead to investment loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. This creates a virtuous circle where a stronger currency attracts more loans at lower costs, further strengthening the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

## The Rise of BRICS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>

Until recently, the G7 (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, main European countries, and Japan) was the sole global power bloc, occasionally including Russia as the G8 before its expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. A new power group, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), has formed to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>.

BRICS has a high chance of success against the G7, as it encompasses 43% of the world's population compared to the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. More countries are joining BRICS to escape the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. The BRICS group openly states its plan to end its subjection to the dollar's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. For example, Brazil's newly elected president, Lula da Silva, stated that ending dollar dominance was one of his objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. Brazil is often considered a spokesperson for China's true intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. This movement could have serious repercussions, leading to an economic earthquake, and the China-led alliance appears increasingly likely to succeed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## Evidence of the Dollar's Decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>

A new paradigm shift quietly began at the 2022 BRICS Summit, where a roadmap to end the dollar's dominance was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>. China is poised to be the primary beneficiary of this global change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

*   **Rise of the Chinese Yuan**: The Chinese Renminbi (Yuan) is gaining market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Since the start of the conflict, Russia's international market share has increased from 2% to 4%, approaching that of the Euro, which remains the second most important currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:00">[06:25:00]</a>.
*   **Dollar Index Plummet**: The value of the dollar on the stock market has sharply declined since the BRICS countries designed their new roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The Dollar Index, which measures the dollar's value against major currencies, has plummeted over 13% in less than nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:50:00">[06:50:00]</a>.
*   **Intra-BRICS Trade**: The BRICS alliance proposes trading within its territory using its own currencies, excluding the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>. This would increase the value and international demand for their currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

## Factors Influencing Global Currency Hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>

While China boasts significant production capacity and advanced technology, and BRICS allies like Brazil and Russia possess vast raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>, the United States holds a key factor for its global dollar hegemony: military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

Historically, countries whose currencies served as world reserves were associated with military superiority that guaranteed economic security and currency prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Spain's currency was the world reserve from 1500-1700 due to its military dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. The British pound took over from 1800-1900 due to its military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. For the last 100 years, the dollar and the US military have been undisputed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>.

China is aware of this and is heavily investing in its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. China's military spending is rapidly approaching that of the US and is estimated to surpass $500 billion annually within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. This investment will likely compel the US to increase its own defense spending to maintain hegemony, benefiting private government contractors in the defense sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

Modern military power is measured by key elements that provide superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>. The US has strong allies in private companies like Lockheed Martin (F-22 Raptor, F-35), General Dynamics (nuclear submarines), Northrop Grumman (B-2 bomber), and Raytheon (Tomahawk missiles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:01:00">[09:01:00]</a>. These companies have seen formidable stock market results due to high demand from G7 governments, maintaining military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. They are also insulated from traditional economic crises as defense spending budgets are linear and constant, with expected growth rates above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>.

## China's Economic Strategy for Change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>

China's second major strategy to force this change is to create a large, tax-free free trade area among all BRICS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. Over 60% of the world's population plans to join this macro area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:23:00">[10:23:00]</a>. In contrast, the US and its G7 allies operate more slowly and bureaucratically; past attempts like the TPP failed due to internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:33:00">[10:33:00]</a>.

## Expert Opinions and Investment Strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>

### Ray Dalio's Perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>

Ray Dalio, a prominent investment fund manager, in his book "The New World Order," explains that economic indicators show China in a phase of ascent while the US is in decline, which will lead to the dollar's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Dalio advises investors to protect themselves from this [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | fall of the dollar]] by investing in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. He considers gold the purest form of money because it cannot be printed out of thin air and protects against currency depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Gold has appreciated by an average of 9% annually over the last 20 years, even when measured against major currencies, outperforming the market with low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>.

There are three ways to invest in gold:
1.  **Physical gold**: Disadvantages include security and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
2.  **Gold mining companies**: Can suffer operational problems due to mining complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:00">[12:47:00]</a>.
3.  **Gold ETFs**: Ray Dalio's preferred method. Examples include GLD (ticker: GLD, price: $182) and EGRN for European investors (ticker: EGRN, price: €35) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:55:00">[12:55:00]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller's View <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>

Stanley Druckenmiller, an expert on currency values, has generated impressive returns primarily by investing in currencies and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:29:00">[13:29:00]</a>. He has expressed a lack of confidence in the Federal Reserve and Biden's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:44:00">[13:44:00]</a>.

> "I have no confidence in the Federal Reserve or in the actions that Biden is taking. Yes. In addition, we add that Lula da Silva is going around saying that he wants to do away with the dollar, it seems like a good bet to sell dollars and buy gold." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>

Druckenmiller believes that if the dollar falls as he expects, it would cause an increase in inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. In such a scenario, he finds inflation-protected bonds, specifically US TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), very interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>. TIPS guarantee a return above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>. Their price has recently been strong as people assume no more inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.

Ways to invest in TIPS:
1.  **Purchase the bond directly**: Can be complex for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.
2.  **ETFs investing in TIPS**: Easier way. Examples include Schwab U.S. TIPS ETF (ticker: SCP, price: $54) with a 6.5% annual yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>. BlackRock offers a similar ETF in Europe (ticker: ITPE, price: €5) which offers a currency-hedged version to mitigate exchange rate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:10:00">[15:10:00]</a>.

### Investment Strategies to Hedge Against Dollar Depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>

If the dollar's value drops, causing inflation, holding liquidity or traditional non-inflation-protected bonds would be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. In periods of inflation, real estate and stock market investments have historically performed satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>.

Specific stock market strategies that [[Investment Strategies to Hedge Against Dollar Depreciation | would benefit]] from a [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | dollar decline]] and inflation:

1.  **US Exporting Companies**: Seek American companies listed in dollars that have a significant export component to other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. When these companies export services or products abroad and translate those foreign currency profits into dollars, their dollar profits would increase, leading to stock appreciation and providing protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. Brexit serves as an example: when the pound fell almost 20%, main [[role_of_large_exporting_companies_in_currency_devaluation_scenarios | exporting companies]] in the UK like Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline sharply rose while the general market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.
    *   *Top 10 US Exporting Companies:* (List not provided in transcript, but implied to be shown in a graph <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>)

2.  **Companies with Exposure to the Chinese Economy**: Look for companies with high exports to China to benefit from its expected economic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Examples include casinos like Wynn and Las Vegas Sands, and technology/semiconductor companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.

3.  **Luxury Sector Companies**: Companies in the luxury sector, typically denominated in euros or dollars, would benefit as Chinese consumers are major buyers of these goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. An economic boom in China would increase sales, translating to higher euro or dollar profits and providing coverage against a dollar decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. Companies like LVMH, Hermès, and Ferrari have historically prospered in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:00">[18:56:00]</a>.

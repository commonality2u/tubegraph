The US Dollar, considered the most important currency in the world, is beginning its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Decisions made by central banks and governments are expected to accelerate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This phenomenon will affect economies and stock markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

Expert investors, such as [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]], who manages the world's largest investment fund, have already stated that the dollar will lose value and are selling the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## The Dollar's Global Position

Currently, the dollar is considered the global foreign exchange reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This means its performance impacts other currencies and economies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Data from the International Monetary Fund shows that 62% of all the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. With a large number of dollarized economies, the real percentage could be higher than 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Evidence of Decline

The effects of the dollar's decline have already started to be noticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Since a recent crisis began, the dollar has devalued over 10% against the Euro in just nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This occurred despite Europe also creating a significant amount of new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. A "chilling fact" highlighting this trend is that in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created, which is significant for a currency with 200 years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Fiat Currency and Monetary Policy

Most major world currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Until the 1970s, new dollars had to be backed by a certain amount of gold deposited in the central bank, which helped control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This changed in the early 1970s with the Bretton Woods Agreement, granting the Federal Reserve the ability to print as many dollars as it wants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

While this tool was historically used with caution, the year 2020 changed everything <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. Data from the Federal Reserve shows that the money supply (M2) has gotten out of control since the beginning of this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell has even declared comfort with a higher level of inflation, indicating an increased money supply and further devaluation of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Currency Devaluation

Historically, aggressive monetary experiments have not worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:
*   The Roman Empire declined when its currency was aggressively devalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   In the early 20th century, Germany tried to repay old debts through printing money and went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Recent cases include Venezuela, which experienced disastrous economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Zimbabwe saw a 100 trillion dollar banknote issued, which now sells as a souvenir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Money had so little value it was transported in wheelbarrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Similarly, in early 2000s Germany, money was used as toys by children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, and in Venezuela, it's used to make tourist souvenirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Expert Investor Views

### [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]]
[[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]], often called the "Steve Jobs of financial markets" for his ability to anticipate economic events, is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. In an interview with Bloomberg, Dalio warned that the dollar could decrease in value and cease to be the world's foreign currency reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He stated that he is investing in gold, inflation-protected bonds, and stocks outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Stanley Druckenmiller]]
Legendary investor [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Stanley Druckenmiller]], known for average annual returns over 30% for three decades without any losses, recently stated in a CNN interview that he is aggressively selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. He has high conviction that the dollar's value will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Druckenmiller sees the current union of the Federal Reserve and the Treasury as an unprecedented precedent since the Fed's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. He foresees inflation increasing over the next 5 or 6 years due to dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a> and is investing in gold and mining companies while selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## [[economic_implications_of_a_declining_dollar | Economic implications of a declining dollar]]

Even for those not living in the US or holding dollars, this economic phenomenon is expected to have an impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Central banks and economies in other countries are replicating the US approach, leading to increased printing of new money in euros, yen, or pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Consequently, money held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Similarly, fixed income or bond investments are seriously affected by increased inflation or currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_to_protect_against_dollar_devaluation | Investment strategies to protect against dollar devaluation]]

Here are several strategies to protect capital and savings from accelerated dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>:

### 1. Real Estate Properties
Investing in real estate is an effective way to protect against currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. However, this often requires significant capital and diversification can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. Financial markets allow investment with lower capital (four figures) and higher diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### 2. Selling Dollars (Forex Market)
The most obvious way to benefit from a potential dollar drop is to sell dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This involves the forex market, where one currency is sold against another (e.g., USD/EUR, USD/GBP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, if the counter-currency also devalues, the profit might be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Gold
Gold acts like a currency but cannot be created out of thin air, unlike dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The price of gold is denominated in dollars, so if dollars in circulation increase and their value falls, the price of gold tends to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Historically, investing in gold was complex due to storage and security costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Now, through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold physical gold, investors can benefit from a rise in gold prices more effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Examples include:
*   **iShares Physical Gold ETC (London Stock Exchange: SGLN)**: Appreciated over 40% in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
*   **SPDR Gold Shares (US: GLD)**: Has performed well over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### 4. Investing in Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)
As [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]] suggests, investing in TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) can be a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. If the dollar falls, inflation increases, and these bonds appreciate in value based on that inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. An easy way to invest is through ETFs like **iShares TIPS Bond ETF (US: TIP)**, which appreciated over 10% year-to-date due to dollar devaluation and high inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### 5. Investing in Stocks Outside the US
To avoid the currency factor of a devalued dollar, investing in stocks denominated in other currencies or from countries outside the US is a strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]] has adopted this, investing $200 million in an ETF of emerging markets that hold stocks of countries less indebted and not needing to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This ETF, **iShares MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (US: EEM)**, has performed well in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### 6. Investing in Large US Exporting Companies
Large US exporting companies can benefit from currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. These companies sell products abroad, theoretically receiving more valuable foreign currency, while their costs remain in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This increases their income and earnings per share, which tends to be reflected in stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

**Historical Examples:**
*   **Rolls Royce (UK)**: After Brexit in 2016, when the pound plummeted over 10%, this UK manufacturer and exporter appreciated over 30% in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline (UK)**: This pharmaceutical exporter also saw its stock rise more than 20% immediately after the pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

**Current Investment Opportunities:**

*   **ExxonMobil (US: XOM)**: The world's largest oil company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It produces raw materials (oil) and exports over half its products outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>. Its stock price is currently depressed due to low oil prices but is expected to rebound as oil returns to historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Based on historical earnings and dividend yield, a target value of $60-75 per share is projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Pfizer (US: PFE)**: A leading biotechnology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Warren Buffett has invested over $135 million in this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. More than 50% of its sales are outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. It has high returns on equity (consistently above 20%) and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. With an estimated earning of $3 per share and a historical sector valuation of 18 times earnings, a target value of $54 per share is projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Other US Exporting Companies**: A list of the 10 largest US exporting companies includes ExxonMobil, Apple, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and Procter & Gamble, which are considered high-quality companies that can perform well in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>.

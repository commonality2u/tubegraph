## Focus on the Pharmaceutical Sector

[[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Warren Buffett's]] recent investment focus has notably shifted to pharmaceutical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

### Reasons for Investment
[[Warren Buffetts latest investment moves | These new investments]] reflect [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett's]] characteristic approach, honed over 60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. He typically seeks:
*   **Good Companies** with predictable and increasing income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Attractive Valuations**, often due to temporary, solvable problems or market oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

Historically, the pharmaceutical sector traded at high valuations due to its excellent business quality and strong long-term prospects, driven by an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, during the Trump administration (2016-2020), the sector faced pressure from continuous threats of new regulations that could reduce profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. With the defeat of Donald Trump and the incoming Democratic administration's plans to invest heavily in healthcare, this threat has dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

This shift leaves great businesses that are very resistant to economic crises (even the 2020 crisis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Their profits have doubled over the last five years, and they have good prospects for continued future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Most interestingly, these shares are trading at an attractive valuation not seen for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Key Pharmaceutical Holdings in [[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett's Portfolio]]

#### Bristol Myers (BM)
[[Warren Buffetts current investment moves | Warren Buffett]] has invested an impressive $1.8 billion in Bristol Myers (ticker: BM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.
*   **Market Position**: This pharmaceutical company holds an excellent market position in oncology and cardiovascular problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Its shares have multiplied more than 30 times over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Crisis Resistance**: These shares are very resistant to economic crises; in 2020, the company confirmed it would grow 6% compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
*   **Profit Forecast**: Bristol Myers confirmed earnings of over $6 per share for 2020 and forecasted over $7 per share for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. This demonstrates high visibility for the business's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Historically, the pharmaceutical sector traded at 20 times earnings. Valuing Bristol Myers conservatively at 15 times its expected 2021 earnings of $7 per share, a target price of over $100 could be reached within one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Given its current trading price of $60, this represents a potential appreciation of over 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Over the next five years, its value could triple to between $150 and $200 per share due to expected sector growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

#### AbbVie (ABBV)
[[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Warren Buffett]] also recently invested over $1 billion in AbbVie (ticker: ABBV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Market Position**: AbbVie holds a leadership position within the pharmaceutical sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Crisis Resistance**: Like Bristol Myers, the 2020 crisis will not affect AbbVie; its profits are expected to increase compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
*   **Financials**:
    *   **Revenue Growth**: In the last five years, revenue grew from $25 billion to over $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   **Profit Margins**: The company consistently boasts operating profits of over 40% on sales, one of the highest among publicly listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This figure is even higher than [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett's]] long-time favorite, Coca-Cola, which has 20% profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.
    *   **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: EPS has grown from $4.80 to over $12 for the next year (2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: With expected 2021 earnings of over $12 per share, a conservative valuation of 15 times earnings would yield a one-year target price of $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Given its current trading price of $100, this suggests significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. In five years, the intrinsic value could exceed $300 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

These strong fundamentals and attractive valuations are key reasons why [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] has shown such interest in the pharmaceutical sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

Warren Buffett has stated that the next crisis is inevitable and has provided tips on how to adapt to the current situation of inflation and other economic risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He emphasizes that inflation affects everyone, and without investing, money will devalue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## The Inevitable Crisis and Inflationary Environment

Warren Buffett believes the next crisis is inevitable and should not surprise people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>. During an annual conference, he noted substantial price increases due to [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], which is being accepted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:07">[02:07:07]</a>. He observed that the economy is "very overheated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:07">[02:17:07]</a>.

This [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] is evident in news such as Walmart having difficulty finding truck drivers and offering salaries up to $100,000, and plumbers in the US earning similar amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>. Recent movements and confinements have led to shortages in certain sectors, causing higher transportation costs, which then leads companies to raise their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.

Buffett has warned that [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] is higher and will continue to be higher than people anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:07">[03:00:07]</a>. He expects a second wave of [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] in 2023 when wages will rise, as they are updated with [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:07">[03:09:07]</a>.

### Currency Devaluation and Debt

The easiest solution to the problem, according to Buffett, will be the devaluation of the dollar or the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:07">[03:32:07]</a>. Governments want to reduce their debt, and by means of [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], they increase their income (by charging a percentage on economic activity) while their debt levels remain constant and do not increase with [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:07">[03:51:07]</a>.

The dollar has devalued significantly, losing practically all its value in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:07">[04:22:07]</a>. For example, in the 1970s, $6.30 could buy 17 oranges, whereas today, $1 can barely buy a McDonald's hamburger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:07">[04:36:07]</a>. Ninety years ago, $20 could buy 670 dozen eggs, while today, $20 buys only 10 dozen eggs in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:07">[05:06:07]</a>.

Buffett describes [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] as "one of the biggest scams there is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:07">[05:22:07]</a>. The trick of [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] is that while the nominal amount of money in an account or the value of assets appears the same, the purchasing power is much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:07">[05:47:07]</a>.

The fiscal stimuli and new money printed by central banks (like the Fed) have been financed with new debt, leading to a "gigantic robbery of the middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:07">[06:24:07]</a>. Governments give this money to companies to build infrastructure or implement digitalization plans, benefiting corporations like Amazon and Alphabet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:07">[07:11:07]</a>. This prosperity is reflected in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:07">[07:50:07]</a>. If individuals are not investing, they will not benefit from this, but the middle class will bear the cost through taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:07">[08:11:07]</a>. The enormous money printing has significantly increased the debt levels of the world's four main economies, from 15 trillion to 25 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:07">[10:06:07]</a>.

## [[Impact of inflation on investments | Impact of Inflation on Investments]]

Having dollars or euros, or investments in liquidity, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits, is "very bad news" during periods of [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:07">[03:38:07]</a>. Such investments, particularly those related to liquidity, will devalue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:07">[04:12:07]</a>.

Warren Buffett equates buying a 10-year bond today that yields 2% to paying 50 times earnings for a business that won't grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>. In contrast, businesses like Visa, trading at 28 times earnings (half the valuation of a bond), offer an immediate 3% return but grow profits at over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:07">[01:16:07]</a>. This combination of growth and immediate profitability results in significantly higher annual returns (e.g., 13% for Visa vs. 2% for a bond), making bonds vulnerable to [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>. He asserts that [[safe_investments_during_high_inflation_periods | conservative fixed income investments]] and deposits have a "very complicated future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>.

### Gold vs. Productive Assets

When asked about gold as a hedge against [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], Buffett noted in a 2011 conference that "if you own an ounce of gold... it will continue to be an ounce of gold" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:20">[01:17:20]</a>. Gold produces nothing, does not generate income, and does not multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>. While gold tends to retain its value in times of [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] because it cannot be printed like fiat money, it lacks productivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:07">[01:40:07]</a>.

In contrast, productive assets like stocks, real estate (houses, apartments), or farmland generate dividends or income, leading to better long-term performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:07">[01:35:07]</a>. Well-managed companies do not dilute shares and can even buy back shares, increasing the value of existing holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's [[Investment strategies in high inflation | Investment Strategies]]

The only way to avoid losing purchasing power in the current environment is to [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | invest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:07">[01:54:07]</a>. Buffett's historical returns, even during periods of galloping [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] in the 1970s and 1980s, were solid, averaging 22% and 40% annually respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:07">[01:43:07]</a>. During these inflationary periods, Buffett did not invest in gold mining or oil companies; instead, he focused on businesses with specific characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>.

### Key Characteristics for Investments in Inflationary Environments

Buffett recommends investing in "fabulous businesses" that:
*   Generate "tons of cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>
*   Require low levels of capital reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:07">[01:51:07]</a>
*   Can raise prices effectively (pricing power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:07">[02:55:07]</a>
*   Engage in share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>

### Examples of [[Investment Opportunities During Inflation | Investment Opportunities]]

1.  **HP**: Warren Buffett recently made a large acquisition of HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:07">[01:47:07]</a>. HP generates substantial operating cash flow (e.g., $6 billion) but requires minimal reinvestment (around 10% of earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:07">[02:02:07]</a>. This low capital intensity means that even if costs double due to [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], the impact on profits is mitigated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>. HP also actively buys back shares, which is a powerful mechanism for increasing shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>.
2.  **Starbucks**: Despite concerns about coffee price [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], Starbucks has demonstrated the ability to raise prices (e.g., 3% above [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] in 2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:07">[03:22:07]</a>. The cost of coffee is a small component of the overall price, allowing profit margins to expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:07">[03:02:07]</a>. The company operates with high EBITDA margins (above 20%) and low reinvestment levels (around 20% of earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>. The return of its founder, Howard Schultz, has historically led to strong performance after challenging periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:07">[03:31:07]</a>.
3.  **CH Robinson**: This logistics broker does not own trucks or airplanes but acts as an intermediary, connecting companies that need transportation with carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:07">[03:12:07]</a>. Its business model makes it highly protected against [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:07">[03:10:07]</a>. As transportation rates rise due to increasing truck driver salaries and oil prices, CH Robinson's revenue (a percentage of the transport cost) increases, while its own costs (primarily technology and personnel) do not rise proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:07">[03:12:07]</a>. It benefits from the price increases without incurring the proportional cost increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:07">[03:35:07]</a>. It has low reinvestment rates (around 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:07">[03:47:07]</a>.
4.  **YUM China (YUMC)**: Similar to CH Robinson, YUMC benefits from [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] because it operates on a franchise model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>. Franchisees can raise menu prices, and YUMC receives a royalty percentage on these higher prices, without directly incurring the increased costs of making the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:07">[03:13:07]</a>. The company has very high profit margins (EBITDA margins of 24%) and exceptionally low reinvestment needs (e.g., 4% of cash flow in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:07">[03:57:07]</a>. It also engages in share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:07">[03:59:07]</a>.
5.  **Google, Apple, Microsoft**: Buffett explicitly mentions these companies as "fabulous businesses" that generate "tons of cash flow" and "do not require capital" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:07">[01:33:07]</a>. They have high profit margins and actively repurchase shares, accelerating earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>.

### Companies to Approach with Caution
*   **Cyclical Businesses (e.g., Micron)**: These companies experience volatile revenues and profits, making them riskier in a volatile economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:07">[01:48:07]</a>. They often require substantial reinvestment, for example, Micron reinvested $10 billion to generate $12 billion in income in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:07">[01:50:07]</a>.
*   **Utility Companies (e.g., Iberdrola)**: While they can raise prices with [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], they have a significant downside: they require massive reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:07">[01:53:07]</a>. For instance, Iberdrola's operating profit of 8 billion last year required 6 billion in reinvestment (almost 70%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:07">[01:56:07]</a>. This high reinvestment means that increased profits due to [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] may not translate into proportional growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.
*   **Companies with Losses**: Investing in companies that are not making money is "tremendously complex" because it requires guessing future growth and profit margins, which makes modeling unreliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.

## Personal [[Strategies to protect and grow capital in inflationary environments | Adaptation Strategy]]

Warren Buffett advises individuals to [[strategies_to_protect_and_grow_capital_in_inflationary_environments | invest in themselves]] and improve their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:07">[02:00:07]</a>. He states that the best investment one can make is in education to increase skills in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:07">[02:11:07]</a>. By being "above average" in one's profession and adding value, one will fare well, regardless of the currency received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:07">[02:04:07]</a>.

### Interest Rate Increases
Regarding [[interest_rates_and_inflation_risks | interest rate increases]], historically, fast increases are more dangerous than slow ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:07">[02:13:07]</a>. The current environment is characterized by slow increases, and even during past periods of rapid rate hikes (e.g., 1973, 1980s), Warren Buffett's investment results remained solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:07">[02:28:07]</a>.

## Conclusion

The rising [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] and [[interest_rates_and_inflation_risks | interest rates and inflation risks]] make it essential to adapt investment strategies. Warren Buffett's approach, emphasizing productive assets with high cash flow, low capital needs, and pricing power, offers a roadmap for [[investment_strategies_during_inflationary_cycles | investment strategies during inflationary cycles]] and [[investment_strategies_during_inflationary_periods | investment strategies during inflationary periods]]. This allows individuals not just to protect, but also to grow capital in inflationary environments. Additionally, investing in one's own skills and education remains a fundamental [[strategies_to_protect_and_grow_capital_in_inflationary_environments | strategy to protect and grow capital in inflationary environments]].

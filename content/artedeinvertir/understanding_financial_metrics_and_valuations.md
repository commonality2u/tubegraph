Understanding financial metrics and [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation techniques]] is crucial for [[Stock Analysis and Investment Strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This guide explores various methods and market dynamics discussed by an experienced fund manager, providing insights into how professionals approach [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | asset valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy

Private investors possess a significant advantage in small-cap companies compared to professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The objective is to empower individuals to "fish" for their own [[Stock Analysis and Investment Strategies | investment]] opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. All information provided is for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Market Conditions and Dynamics

The market currently exhibits a dichotomy, with some sectors experiencing euphoria while others face pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Overall, the market is slightly more expensive than its average, influenced by low interest rates, quantitative easing by the Federal Reserve, and recovery hopes driven by vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. This polarization means some companies are trading at very high valuations without profits, while others are very cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

Market falls are inevitable, occurring approximately every 12 months (10% drop) and every 5 years (over 20% drop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>. Major drops (40-50%) happen every 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>. It's difficult to predict these downturns consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>. Maintaining some liquidity (e.g., 10-20%) allows investors to capitalize on opportunities during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:10">[01:20:10]</a>.

The Federal Reserve's actions, particularly regarding liquidity and interest rates, significantly influence the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. Current low interest rates fuel high valuations, especially in speculative areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:09">[01:25:09]</a>. A change in the Fed's narrative would be a cause for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

### Market Valuation Metrics

The broader market (S&P 500) trades around 22 times future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. This is considered somewhat expensive, though not at extreme bubble levels seen in historical examples like Japan's Nikkei index in the 1980s, which reached 100 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>. Despite high valuations, in some years, the S&P 500 has still delivered positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:17">[01:27:17]</a>. However, historical data suggests that higher starting valuations generally lead to lower subsequent returns over a 5-year period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:59">[01:27:59]</a>. At current valuations, the expected return for the S&P 500 over the next 5 years could be close to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. This suggests a market more suited for [[Stock Analysis and Investment Strategies | "stock picking"]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>.

## [[Valuation Techniques for Stocks and Investment Strategies | Valuation Techniques]]

Several financial metrics are used to assess a company's [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | intrinsic value]] and [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | growth potential]]:

*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: Relates a company's share price to its earnings per share. A low P/E ratio often suggests a cheap valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio**: Compares a company's market capitalization to its revenue. Commonly used for high-growth companies that may not yet be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. Paying more than 10 times sales historically does not yield good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: The cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support operations and maintain its capital assets. It's a strong indicator of a company's financial health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: A measure of a company's operating performance. Used as a proxy for cash earnings, especially for companies with significant non-cash expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:26">[02:08:26]</a>.
*   **Gross Merchant Value (GMV)**: Total value of merchandise sold over a period, especially relevant for e-commerce platforms and marketplaces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a>. Companies are valued based on GMV, with multiples varying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Operating Leverage**: The relationship between a company's fixed and variable costs. High operating leverage means a small increase in revenue can lead to a disproportionately larger increase in profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:32">[00:27:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.
*   **Sum-of-the-Parts Valuation**: Valuing each distinct business unit of a company separately and then summing them up to arrive at a total company valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

## Company Examples and Their [[Valuation and Performance of Specific Stocks and Sectors | Valuations]]

### IDT Corporation (IDT)
IDT operates a mature business generating significant cash flow, which is then reinvested into high-growth technological or disruptive ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Its strategy involves generating value through spinoffs, having completed six such transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. The company has delivered an average annual return of 20% for shareholders over the last 10 years when including spinoff values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

*   **Traditional Business**: Generates approximately $60 million in cash flow annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **New Businesses**:
    *   **BOSS Revolution (Money Transfer)**: Experiencing impressive growth (e.g., 110% year-over-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. This division alone could be worth up to $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.
    *   **Point of Sale (POS)**: Growing significantly, though not yet profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>.
    *   **Net to Phone (Cloud Communications)**: Growing at 42% annually by targeting niche markets like Latin America and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>. Valued conservatively by the company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>, it has significant upside compared to similar companies like Ring Central (RNG), which trades at 40 times sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.
*   **Overall Valuation**: With a market capitalization of $500 million, $120 million in liquidity, and $200 million in tax deductions (NOLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>, the traditional business trades at a very cheap multiple of 6 times earnings, compared to a normal telecom multiple of 12-15 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. The sum of the parts suggests a value of up to $50 per share, compared to a current price of $19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Cedon
Described as the "Amazon of Sweden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>, Cedon is an e-commerce company that underwent a spinoff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. Initially overlooked due to information being in Swedish and its spinoff status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, it has seen significant revaluation, multiplying by three since initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>.

*   **Business Model**: Pivoted from a 1P (own sales) model to a 3P (marketplace) model, which is more profitable and has higher margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>. The marketplace segment has grown at 60% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:50">[00:25:50]</a> and EBITDA has grown 120% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trades at 11 times Gross Merchant Value for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>, which is cheaper than similar marketplaces (5-10x GMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. Its positive EBITDA and high operating leverage suggest significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:23">[00:27:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. An analyst's recent "buy" recommendation led to a 25% price increase in one day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)
A major defense contractor, Lockit Martin's stock has dropped due to fears that a Democratic administration would cut defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. This is considered a false belief, as core programs like the F-35 fighter jet, which provide military supremacy, are rarely cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Historical data shows profit growth even during periods of defense budget cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>.

*   **Valuation**: Estimated normalized earnings of $26 for the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Historically, defense companies trade at 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>. At this multiple, LMT should be worth around $500, higher than its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>.

### Nikola (NKLA) and QuantumScape (QS)
These companies represent extreme speculation in the market.
*   **Nikola**: Exposed as having "smoke and mirrors" with no real products or sales, yet valued at $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:21">[00:39:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:33">[00:39:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:44">[00:39:44]</a>.
*   **QuantumScape**: A SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) that went public via a less scrutinized method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:07">[00:40:07]</a>. It claims new battery technology but has no sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. Its price surged, and insiders sold large amounts of shares, indicating a lack of long-term confidence from those who promoted it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:42:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.

### IPCO (Oil Company)
A small oil company trading cheaply due to the out-of-favor oil sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:40">[00:43:40]</a>. It produces $100-150 million in profit and is capitalized at $400 million, valuing it at only 4 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:58">[00:43:58]</a>. Typically, oil companies trade at 8-10 times earnings, suggesting potential for doubling or tripling in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:08">[00:44:08]</a>.

### Humia (JMIA)
Referred to as the "Amazon of Africa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>, Humia is a high-growth e-commerce company, similar to Cedon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. It's expected to grow 32% this year but does not yet produce profits or positive EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:02">[00:46:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. It's valued at about 20 times sales with a capitalization of $3-4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:21">[00:46:21]</a>, which is considered a generous multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:26">[00:46:26]</a>. Humia's Gross Merchant Value is significantly higher than its capitalization, suggesting it might be cheaper compared to other similar companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA) and NIO (NIO)
These electric vehicle companies are subject to very demanding valuations, discounting significant future growth from software and other new categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:42">[01:32:42]</a>. While they have seen massive price increases, current valuations are very high, and a miss on short-term expectations could lead to significant falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>.

### Globant (GLOB), EPAM Systems (EPAM), and Nagarro
These are IT services companies specializing in computer engineering through an "offshore" model, hiring engineers in lower-cost regions like Latin America, Eastern Europe, and India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:17">[01:06:17]</a>. This model allows them to steal market share from traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>.

*   **Globant**: Has grown revenue from $250 million to $800 million in 5 years, with EBITDA growing from $30 million to $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:02">[00:53:02]</a>. It trades at around 70-80 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>, justified by the massive market and potential for sustained 20% annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   **EPAM**: A larger player in the market, expected to turn over $3.2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:41">[00:53:41]</a>. It trades at 50 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:13">[00:59:13]</a>.
*   **Nagarro**: A spinoff from Germany that has grown revenue from $200 million to $400 million between 2017-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>. It is expected to grow revenue to $500 million and generate $80-90 million in EBITDA in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:09">[00:56:09]</a>. While newer to being publicly listed, its valuation is cheaper than its peers, suggesting significant upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

### Johnson & Johnson (JNJ), AbbVie (ABBV), and Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY)
These are mature pharmaceutical companies.
*   **Johnson & Johnson**: A stable, crisis-resistant company with low debt. Expected to earn $10 per share in 2021-2022 and trades at $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:51">[01:01:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:57">[01:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>. Historically, it trades at 20-25 times earnings, implying a potential value of $200-250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.
*   **AbbVie & Bristol Myers Squibb**: Acquired by Warren Buffett, these are very cheap and trade at valuations like $100 per share earning $13 normalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>. Their prices were suppressed by regulatory threats from the Trump administration, but profits have risen, making them attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:19">[01:05:19]</a>.

### HP (HPQ)
A company with a declining consumer and printer division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. It earns around $1.50-$1.80 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:59">[01:05:59]</a>. As a non-growth company, it might be valued at 10-15 times earnings, implying a potential value of $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:07">[01:06:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:14">[01:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:25">[01:06:25]</a>.

### APi Group (APG)
A simple business growing at 10-15% annually, specializing in fire alarm system installation and maintenance, electrical installations, and liquid waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:26">[01:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>. 80% of its income is very stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>. It was founded by Martin Franklin, a veteran value generator who previously created significant value with Harden Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:28">[01:08:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>.

### Nomad Foods (NOMD)
A company that sells frozen products in Europe, including brands like Findus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. It grows organically at 2-3% and through acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>. It generates around $300 million euros in free cash flow, equivalent to $400 million in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:14">[01:11:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:21">[01:11:21]</a>. It trades at 11 times cash flow, considered cheap for a stable food consumption business, which should typically trade at 15-25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. A 5-year projection suggests doubling in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

### Alibaba (BABA)
A large Chinese e-commerce giant, which has recently faced issues with the Chinese government, particularly concerning its Ant Group financial affiliate due to control over the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:08">[01:36:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:16">[01:36:16]</a>. Despite regulatory challenges, Alibaba recently posted its best-ever results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:17">[01:37:17]</a>. It trades at 20-25 times earnings, which is cheaper than similar companies in Asia or the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:44">[01:37:44]</a>.

### Enbridge (ENB) and Kinder Morgan (KMI)
These companies own monopolies in gas and oil transportation pipelines in the United States, a sector currently out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:12">[01:38:12]</a>.
*   **Enbridge**: Trades at about 8 times normalized earnings, historically trading at 16 times, suggesting it's half its historical [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:41">[01:38:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>. It offers a sustainable dividend yield of 7.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:59">[01:38:59]</a>.
*   **Kinder Morgan**: Similar profile to Enbridge, with slightly more debt. Its free cash flow generation is around $3.4 billion, trading at about 10 times free cash flow when it should be at 16 times historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:17">[01:43:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:29">[01:43:29]</a>.

### Fiverr (FVRR) and Etsy (ETSY)
These are online marketplaces.
*   **Fiverr**: Currently trades at 40 times sales ($10 billion market cap on $259 million revenue) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:24">[01:45:24]</a>. While it's growing rapidly (75% this year), its growth is expected to slow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:19">[01:46:19]</a>. To justify its current [[Evaluating company valuations and market conditions | valuation]], it would need to reach $5 billion in revenue with high profit margins in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:42">[01:47:42]</a>.
*   **Etsy**: A success story, having achieved significant scale and 30% EBITDA margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:26">[01:48:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:35">[01:48:35]</a>. It demonstrated how margins can expand as a company gains scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:40">[01:48:40]</a>.

### Redbubble (RBL)
An Australian-listed global marketplace similar to Etsy, but earlier in its growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:47">[01:48:47]</a>.

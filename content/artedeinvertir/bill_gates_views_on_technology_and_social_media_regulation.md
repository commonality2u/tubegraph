[[Bill Gates]], a prominent global figure and investor, has expressed significant concerns regarding future societal and economic stability, particularly highlighting the role of technology and the need for social media regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:29">[03:18:29]</a>. His recent investment decisions reflect a shift away from certain technology sectors, aligning with his cautious outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:14">[03:27:14]</a>.

## Historical Context and Investment Acumen

[[Bill Gates]] co-founded Microsoft at a young age, leading to his status as one of the world's wealthiest individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>. Despite this, Microsoft shares currently represent only 2% of his total assets, as he has extensively diversified his portfolio into other sectors and listed shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:89">[01:32:89]</a>.

He has demonstrated a remarkable ability to foresee market trends and invest wisely, particularly given his deep understanding of the economy and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:81">[01:44:81]</a>. For instance, [[Bill Gates prediction on crisis resolution | he warned of a crisis similar to the 2019 event]] and predicted its resolution, though his warnings were initially unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:83">[00:54:83]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>. His foresight extended to the pharmaceutical sector, where he invested in companies like Novavax and BioNTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>, even predicting that Pfizer and BioNTech would be among the first to develop a solution to a global problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>.

## Concerns Regarding Social Media and Governance

[[Bill Gates]] expressed concern over public distrust in governments, stating that effective crisis response requires collective trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:95">[03:07:95]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:93">[03:15:93]</a>. He specifically articulated that social networks must be regulated, as they are contributing to societal and economic division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:29">[03:18:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:04">[03:22:04]</a>. These statements potentially explain his recent shift in [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio changes | investment strategy]].

## Strategic Divestment from Technology

[[Bill Gates selling shares and reasons behind it | Bill Gates has recently undertaken a rapid sale of shares from his portfolio]], warning of a new risk potentially worse than recent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:89">[00:11:89]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. His investment firm has sold 12 of its 18 holdings and has not purchased any new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:79">[02:39:79]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:24">[02:43:24]</a>.

Despite his background, [[Bill Gates]] has sold the majority of his technology shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:14">[03:27:14]</a>.
*   **Reduced Exposure to Technology:** He has reduced his exposure to technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>, which has proven wise as the Nasdaq technology index plummeted over 30% in the first five months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:33">[04:30:33]</a>.
*   **Sale of Google Shares:** He sold all his Google shares, one of the few technology companies he previously held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:27">[04:00:27]</a>. Following this communication, Google's shares fell over 25% in less than 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:11">[04:07:11]</a>.
*   **Microsoft and Alibaba:** The only technology company he retains in his portfolio is Microsoft, which constitutes only 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:15">[04:14:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:11">[04:16:11]</a>. He also successfully divested from all his Alibaba shares at $225 per share, just before they dropped to under $90 a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:68">[04:52:68]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:04">[05:01:04]</a>.
*   **Betting Against Tesla:** [[Bill Gates]] has begun to bet against Tesla shares, a company founded by Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:53">[05:43:53]</a>. Despite being a proponent of climate change initiatives and renewable energies, he reportedly dislikes Tesla shares and its founder, having had public confrontations with Musk on social networks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:65">[05:58:65]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:30">[06:04:30]</a>. He himself drives a Porsche Taycan, a competitor to Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:82">[06:11:82]</a>. Tesla shares have plummeted over 50% recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:70">[06:25:70]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:08">[06:27:08]</a>. One potential reason for this decision is Tesla's high valuation, trading at over 50 times earnings compared to a market average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:69">[06:39:69]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:06">[07:10:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:64">[07:14:64]</a>. This echoes his firsthand experience during the 2000 tech bubble, where Microsoft shares, despite strong profit growth, plummeted 50% due to high valuation and took over 12 years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:50">[06:49:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:77">[07:03:77]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:91">[07:06:91]</a>.

## Shift Towards Defensive Investments

His investment strategy has pivoted towards very predictable and defensive sectors, aiming to minimize impact during economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:39">[07:38:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:03">[07:44:03]</a>. This includes businesses such as Ecolab (water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection) and Waste Management (garbage collection), both known for their competitive advantages and resistance to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:47">[08:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:37">[10:15:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:05">[10:21:05]</a>. He has also maintained investments in Coca-Cola FEMSA, a defensive and predictable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:24">[12:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:47:04">[12:47:04]</a>. Additionally, his significant accumulation of farmland, making him the largest landowner in the United States, was a successful move predating the recent rise in food prices and global inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:21">[13:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:83">[13:03:83]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:47">[13:09:47]</a>.

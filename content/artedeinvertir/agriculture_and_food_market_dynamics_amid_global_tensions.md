The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine is expected to significantly impact global markets, particularly the stock markets and the broader economy, with the Russian stock market experiencing a collapse even more severe than the 2008 crisis or the COVID-19 confinement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[[00:00:04]]</a>. This situation escalates pre-existing supply crises and inflation, leading to potential [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | severe economic consequences]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[[00:01:49]]</a>.

## Impact on Energy Markets
The conflict has caused significant disruptions in [[energy_and_raw_material_markets_under_geopolitical_tensions | energy and raw material markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[[00:01:40]]</a>. Germany's suspension of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline certification, intended to bring Russian gas to Europe, has led to a skyrocketing of gas prices, which were already high due to supply issues and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[[00:01:31]]</a>. This exacerbates the [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | energy crisis and geopolitical tensions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[[00:01:52]]</a>. Oil prices have also surged, nearing $100 a barrel, compared to $50 a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[[00:02:00]]</a>. Such increases reduce consumer disposable income, negatively affecting consumption, which accounts for 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[[00:02:10]]</a>.

Russia produces 10 million barrels of oil daily, approximately 10% of global consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[[00:04:20]]</a>. Even a small supply gap of 2-4 million barrels could cause disproportionate price increases, as seen in 2008 when oil jumped from $100 to $150 in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[[00:04:35]]</a>. If sanctions prevent Russia from trading its oil, it could create a global bottleneck, severely impacting energy costs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[[00:05:02]]</a>.

European natural gas prices have tripled compared to a year ago, reaching 60-70 euros per megawatt, indicating that while supply may be secure, prices are exceptionally high, posing a significant problem for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[[00:05:30]]</a>. Russian gas exports to Europe were already at very low levels in 2021 due to prior tensions, further aggravating the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[[00:06:31]]</a>.

## Impact on Agriculture and Food
The [[food_and_energy_crises | food and energy crises]] are intertwined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[[00:06:55]]</a>. Food prices were already rising due to inflation, and the conflict is expected to worsen this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[[00:07:00]]</a>. Russia is a major global producer of grains and wheat, ranking fourth worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[[00:07:08]]</a>. Including Ukraine, the two countries account for approximately 20% of global production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[[00:07:17]]</a>. Sanctions and conflict could significantly reduce this supply. In commodity markets, even a 3-5% reduction in supply can cause disproportionate price increases of 50-100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[[00:07:34]]</a>. The food commodity price index has recently surged to levels of 500, far above the historical average of 200-250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[[00:08:06]]</a>.

## Impact on Fertilizers
The fertilizer market is another critical point. Russia and Ukraine are large producers of potassium, a key component in fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[[00:08:33]]</a>. Russia accounts for almost 20% of global production, including Belarusian output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[[00:08:48]]</a>. High fertilizer prices directly impact food costs and contribute to higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[[00:09:00]]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Opportunities
Historically, stock markets tend to fall before conflicts, but often recover after negative events occur, as people realize the situation is not the "end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[[00:09:56]]</a>. The saying "buy with the drums of war and sell with the sound or melody of the violin" reflects this trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[[00:09:39]]</a>. Past conflicts like Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, and Crimea have shown bullish behavior in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[[00:09:48]]</a>. The invasion of Iraq in 1990, which saw a significant market fall, recovered within 180 days, offering 20% returns to investors who bought during the dip <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[[00:11:15]]</a>. Even the Pearl Harbor attack, which caused 20% drops, recovered in less than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[[00:11:40]]</a>.

[[investment_strategies_during_economic_and_geopolitical_tensions | Investment strategies during economic and geopolitical tensions]] suggest that buying during conflicts can lead to greater returns, as assets become cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[[00:12:53]]</a>. Quality companies with solid businesses can raise prices to offset costs, maintaining profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[[00:13:17]]</a>. Paradoxically, safe investments like bonds tend to offer less return during conflicts because capital flows into them, making them more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[[00:14:31]]</a>.

### Cyclical Stocks and Agriculture
The fertilizer sector presents [[investment_opportunities_related_to_agriculture | investment opportunities related to agriculture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[[00:21:51]]</a>. Companies like Mosaic (and Nutrien/OCI) that produce fertilizers from various chemical bases, especially potassium, could benefit if sanctions prevent Russian trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[[00:22:19]]</a>. These international companies, not subject to Russian restrictions, could see increased demand and higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[[00:22:31]]</a>.

However, cyclical stocks like Mosaic are characterized by periods of high and low performance over long durations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[[00:23:31]]</a>. They are often "good for renting, not for investing" long-term, meaning they are better for speculative short-term gains rather than long-term ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[[00:24:36]]</a>. The best time to buy such stocks is when their P/E valuation is highest, as this usually correlates with low raw material prices, indicating an impending improvement in results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[[00:20:59]]</a>.

John Deere, an agricultural machinery company, could also potentially benefit from rising grain prices and an emphasis on agriculture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:52">[[00:39:52]]</a>.

### Stock Market Reactions
The [[stock_market_reactions_to_geopolitical_conflicts | stock market reactions to geopolitical conflicts]] often involve a general fear that causes all stocks to fall, sometimes indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[[00:14:01]]</a>. This creates opportunities for investors to buy good companies at discounted prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[[00:14:03]]</a>. For example, defense stocks tend to rise during these times, but long-term investors should consider fundamental value rather than just short-term speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[[00:15:52]]</a>.

The market downturn due to geopolitical tensions is often an "excuse" for a necessary cleanup in overvalued sectors, particularly technology stocks which saw a "gigantic bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[[00:36:24]]</a>. When confidence is low, the most expensive and overvalued assets collapse first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[[00:37:02]]</a>. This broader market correction can drag down fundamentally sound companies, creating buying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:02">[[00:37:02]]</a>. Investors should be prepared for portfolios to fall 40-50% in individual stocks, as this is a normal part of market cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[[00:40:47]]</a>. Learning to take advantage of periods of fear or market crises is key to achieving good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[[00:29:10]]</a>.

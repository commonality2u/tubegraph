The US dollar, considered the most important currency globally, has begun to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This shift is driven by an alliance led by China and the BRICS countries, which aims to end the dollar's dominance as the world reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This significant change is expected to affect the value of currencies, savings, investments, inflation levels, and even the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Why the Dollar's Dominance is Shifting

The US dollar's status as the world's most important currency grants the United States several privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This includes the ability to print large amounts of new dollars with minimal inflation, due to constant global demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. For instance, to resolve the 2020 crisis, 23% of all dollars in circulation were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This contrasts sharply with other countries, like Argentina, which experienced 60% annual inflation after increasing its central bank balance sheet by 80% to solve a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The US Federal Reserve, by comparison, increased its balance sheet by over 120% in less than a year and a half during the 2020 crisis, yet inflation currently stands at only 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

Another key advantage is that the dollar's status allows the United States and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries, providing a competitive economic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### The Rise of BRICS

Historically, global power was concentrated in the G7 (United States, Canada, United Kingdom, main European countries, and Japan), which once included Russia as the G8 before its expulsion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A new power group, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), has formed to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. BRICS represents 43% of the world's population, compared to the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. More countries are joining BRICS to escape dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

BRICS members, particularly China, openly seek to end the dollar's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Brazilian President Lula da Silva stated his objective to end dollar dominance, a sentiment often seen as reflecting China's views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This movement could lead to an "economic earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

The roadmap to end dollar dominance was established at the BRICS Summit in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The Chinese Renminbi (Yuan) is gaining market share; its international market share has doubled from 2% to 4% since the start of the conflict in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. The dollar's value on the stock market, as measured by the Dollar Index, has plummeted over 13% in less than 9 months since this roadmap was designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

BRICS countries propose trading within their territory using their own currencies, excluding the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. China's enormous production capacity and advanced technology, combined with BRICS allies' raw material resources (like Brazil and Russia), could allow China to push for the Yuan to become the dominant currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

### The Role of Military Supremacy

A key factor in a currency's global hegemony is military supremacy, which guarantees economic security and currency prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Historically, currencies that were world reserves (e.g., Spain's currency between 1500-1700, the Pound between 1800-1900) were backed by military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The dollar's undisputed reign for the last 100 years is tied to the US military <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

China is significantly investing in its military capabilities, with spending estimated to surpass that of the United States in less than five years, exceeding $500 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This increased spending by China is expected to force the US to do the same to maintain hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Free Trade Area Initiatives

China's second major strategy to force this change is to create a large, tax-free free trade area among all BRICS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Over 60% of the world's population plans to join this macro-area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In contrast, the United States and its G7 allies operate more slowly and bureaucratically; past attempts, like the TPP, failed due to internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Expert Warnings

*   **Ray Dalio**: The world's largest investment fund manager, Ray Dalio, warns that based on economic indicators, China is in a phase of ascent while the United States is in decline, which will lead to the dollar's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. In his book, *The New World Order*, he explains this shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
*   **Stanley Druckenmiller**: Considered a leading expert on currency value, Stanley Druckenmiller, who has generated 30% annual returns for 30 years without losses primarily in currencies and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, has expressed no confidence in the Federal Reserve or current US administration actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. He suggests selling dollars and buying gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. He also anticipates that a fall in the dollar will cause an increase in inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.

## Investment Strategies to Hedge Against Dollar Depreciation

Many experts suggest [[strategies_to_protect_savings_from_dollar_devaluation | investment strategies]] to protect savings and benefit from this new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### 1. Investing in Gold
Ray Dalio advises investors to protect themselves from the dollar's fall by investing in gold, calling it the "purest form of money" that cannot be printed out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Gold protects against the decline in value of other currencies, as all currencies tend to depreciate long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

*   **Performance**: Gold has appreciated by an average of 9% annually over the last 20 years when measured against major currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. This performance is higher than the general market during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It also exhibits low volatility, with significant falls in only one year out of the last 20 (in 2013) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Ways to Invest**:
    *   **Physical Gold**: Involves disadvantages such as security and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
    *   **Gold Mining Companies**: Can suffer from operational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
    *   **Gold ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)**: This is the method Ray Dalio uses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.
        *   **SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)**: The most famous US-listed gold ETF, ticker GLD, priced around $182 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. It has shown a 9.5% yield in the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
        *   **Invesco Physical Gold ETC (EGRN)**: European alternative, ticker EGRN, priced around 35 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### 2. Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)
Stanley Druckenmiller finds US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) very interesting in a scenario of increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. These bonds guarantee a return above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

*   **Ways to Invest**:
    *   **Direct Purchase**: Can be complex for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   **TIPS ETFs**: An easier way to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
        *   **Schwab US TIPS ETF (SCHP)**: US-listed ETF, ticker SCHP, priced around $54 per share, with an annual yield of 6.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.
        *   **Blackrock iShares TIPS EUR Hedged UCITS ETF (ITPE)**: European alternative, ticker ITPE, priced around 5 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This is a currency-hedged version, covering the risk of dollar depreciation against the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.

### 3. General Investment Strategies during Inflation
If the dollar's value falls, it would likely produce inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[01:00:00]</a>. In such a scenario, holding liquidity or traditional bonds unprotected against inflation is the worst idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Historically, [[investment_strategies_in_high_inflation | real estate investments]] and [[investment_strategies_in_high_inflation | stock market investments]] in shares have performed satisfactorily during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. These could be considered as [[investment_strategies_during_economic_instability | investment strategies during economic instability]].

### 4. Forex Market Operations
If a currency's value is expected to drop sharply, one can operate in the forex (foreign exchange) market, selling one currency against another (e.g., US dollar against Chinese yuan) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### 5. Investing in Export-Oriented US Companies
Another smart strategy is to look for American companies listed in dollars that have a significant export component to countries using other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>. When these companies convert foreign currency profits into dollars, their profits would increase, leading to potential stock market appreciation and providing protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. A historical example is Brexit, where the pound fell by almost 20%, but main exporting companies in the UK, such as Rolls Royce and Glaxo Smith Klein, saw their stock prices rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

### 6. Investing in US Companies with Exposure to the Chinese Economy
To benefit from an expected economic boom in China, consider American companies with high exposure to the Chinese economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Examples include high-quality companies like the Wynn and Las Vegas Sands casinos, or technology and semiconductor companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.

### 7. Investing in Luxury Sector Companies
Companies in the luxury sector are also an option. Many of these companies have their currencies denominated in euros or dollars, and Chinese consumers have become major buyers of luxury goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:27]</a>. An economic boom in China would increase sales, translating into higher profits in euros or dollars, thus providing coverage against a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Companies like Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Ferrari have historically prospered in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

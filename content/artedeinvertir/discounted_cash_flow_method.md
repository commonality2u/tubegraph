The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) method is an academic approach to calculating the [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] of an investment or stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. To be successful in investing, one must strive to pay less than what an asset is truly worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Definition and Concept
Academically, the [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] of a stock is defined by discounted cash flows (DCF), also referred to as "df efe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a>. This method involves discounting at an appropriate rate what a company is projected to earn throughout its entire lifespan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:46">[01:46:46]</a>. An image example for Microsoft shows that the stock price (red line) sometimes diverges from the intrinsic value, calculated by different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The goal is to buy a stock when its market price is below the estimated intrinsic value; the larger this difference, the potentially greater the return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. If the valuation is performed well, the market is expected to align with the estimated value within one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.

## Formula
The formula for discounted cash flow is presented as:
Cash Flow (period 1) / (1 + r)^1 + Cash Flow (period 2) / (1 + r)^2 + ... <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>.
In this formula:
*   'r' represents the discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:55">[02:49:55]</a>.
*   'n' represents the number of periods, indicating that cash flows further out in time have less weight in the overall calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>.

## Limitations and Problems
A significant problem with the DCF method is that the projected profits of the company for the next five years have a very small impact on the final valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. For example, if a share trades at 30 euros, the impact of the next five years' earnings might only be 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:23">[02:23:23]</a>. The first four or five years of cash flows have a minimal weight on the final result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:13">[03:13:13]</a>.

Investing is considered an art rather than an exact science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:54">[01:54:54]</a>. Predicting a company's earnings 10 or 15 years into the future is inherently difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:03">[02:03:03]</a>. Due to these limitations, this academic or "scientific" method is considered to have little practical application in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:31">[02:31:31]</a>. Consequently, the method of [[valuation_by_multiples | valuation by multiples]] was developed as a more reliable alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:24">[03:24:24]</a>.

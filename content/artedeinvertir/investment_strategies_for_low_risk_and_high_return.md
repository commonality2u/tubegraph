The All Weather Portfolio, created by Ray Dalio, the world's largest investment fund manager, is an [[investment strategies for longterm growth | investment method]] designed to provide positive returns with low risk. This system has consistently yielded positive returns when used for at least 17 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, boasting an average annual return of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Notably, it performs exceptionally well during periods of stock market decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Ray Dalio and the All Weather Portfolio

Ray Dalio is regarded as an innovator in financial markets, having introduced multiple advancements to the [[strategies for stock market investment | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He began managing just $10,000 over 45 years ago from his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. Today, his investment fund manages over $130 billion, making it the largest globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The All Weather Portfolio is one of his key innovations, initially used privately for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Its success, attributed to providing predictable results with very low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>, led to substantial capital influx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Recently, Dalio decided to make this system public to benefit the broader [[investment opportunities and strategies | investment community]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## Performance and Resilience

The All Weather Portfolio's performance speaks for itself. Over the last 30 years, it has only produced losses in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>, with the maximum annual loss being just 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Its average annual return for the remaining years has been over 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, meaning an investor could, on average, double their assets every 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This method requires minimal effort, mainly involving buying and holding assets with an annual rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Maintaining the necessary psychological discipline to stick to the plan is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

### Historical Performance During Crises

Analysis from lazyportfolio.com illustrates the portfolio's impressive resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>:
*   A $1,000 investment in 2007 grew to over $2,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   The 2020 crisis was barely perceptible in its performance chart due to its high resistance to volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

#### Case Studies: Market Crashes
| Crisis          | All Weather Portfolio Max Loss | Recovery Time | American Stock Market (S&P 500) Max Loss | Recovery Time (to pre-crisis levels) |
| :-------------- | :----------------------------- | :------------ | :--------------------------------------- | :----------------------------------- |
| **2008-2009**   | 12% (July 2008 - Feb 2009) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a> | < 7 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a> | 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>                            | 4 years (until 2012) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>     |
| **March 2020**  | 2.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>                      | 1 month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>     | 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>                             |                                      |

This performance highlights the portfolio's high resilience during [[investment strategies during economic volatility | market crises]] and volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

## The Philosophy of Economic Seasons

Ray Dalio's approach to the All Weather Portfolio stems from his realization that predicting economic behavior is nearly impossible due to numerous correlated variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He simplified the problem by identifying two primary variables affecting the stock market: inflation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Each of these can exist in two states (high or low), leading to four "economic seasons":
*   High inflation
*   Low inflation
*   High economic growth
*   Low economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>

The All Weather Portfolio is designed to perform well in each of these scenarios, much like a house built to withstand all types of weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Recommended Assets and Allocation

Ray Dalio recommends four main asset classes for this portfolio:
1.  **Stocks**
2.  **Bonds**
3.  **Commodities**
4.  **Gold** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>

Here's how each asset class performs in different economic scenarios:

### Asset Performance Across Seasons

*   **High Economic Growth:**
    *   **Stocks:** Perform well due to increased corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   **Commodities:** Price increases as demand rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   *Example:* In 2019, large-cap American stocks rose over 30%, and commodities like gold rose over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

*   **Low Economic Growth:**
    *   **Bonds:** Perform very well as a safe, conservative investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **Stocks & Commodities:** Typically perform poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   *Example:* In 2020, 20-year American government bonds appreciated over 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

*   **Accelerating Inflation:** [[investment strategies in high inflation | Investment strategies in high inflation]]
    *   **Commodities & Gold:** Star assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   **Stocks:** Do moderately well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    *   **Bonds:** Perform terribly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

*   **Downward Inflation:**
    *   **Bonds:** Perform quite well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
    *   **Stocks:** Behave satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   **Commodities & Gold:** Do not behave as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Recommended Asset Weights for Small Investors

The portfolio assigns specific weights to each asset to ensure satisfactory performance in any economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Small investors can replicate this strategy using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>:

1.  **Large-Cap American Stocks (30% weighting):**
    *   Replicated by purchasing the ETF for the Standard and Poor's 500 (ticker: SPY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   Price: ~$317 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

2.  **Long-Term American Bonds (40% weighting):**
    *   Replicated by purchasing the iShares Treasury Bonds 20 years ETF (ticker: TLT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
    *   Price: ~$160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

3.  **Medium-Term American Bonds (15% weighting):**
    *   Replicated by purchasing the iShares Treasury Bonds 3-7 years ETF (ticker: IEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.
    *   Price: ~$133 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.
    *   ETFs offer a lower entry barrier to the bond market, typically requiring a minimum investment of one share (e.g., $133) compared to direct bond issues that can require $25,000-$100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

4.  **Commodities (7.5% weighting):**
    *   Replicated by purchasing the iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust ETF (ticker: GSG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>.
    *   Price: ~$10.70 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
    *   This ETF invests in various raw materials, including oil (almost 40%), aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

5.  **Gold (7.5% weighting):**
    *   Replicated by purchasing the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (ticker: GLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.
    *   Price: ~$169 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
    *   GLD, the largest gold ETF globally, holds an incredible sum of $50 billion in gold, with 45 tons deposited at the Bank of England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Portfolio Rebalancing

A critical step for this [[Investment Strategies and Portfolio Management | investment method]] is to rebalance the portfolio every 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This ensures that the assets return to their original recommended weights within the Four Seasons strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Recent Adjustments by Ray Dalio

While Ray Dalio continues to utilize the Four Seasons strategy for his investment funds, he is currently making certain adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Analysis of his public portfolio (Bridgewater's main positions) reveals three key changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>:
1.  **Reduced Weight in Bonds:** A slight reduction in bond allocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
2.  **Increased Weight in Gold:** Gold allocation has increased to over 15%, which is double the original strategy's recommendation (e.g., 11% in GLD, plus another gold ETF at 4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
3.  **Increased Weight in International Stocks:** Ray Dalio is increasing exposure to international stocks, including ETFs for India (ticker: INBA) and emerging countries like Brazil or Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. His total stock allocation is around 24% through S&P 500 ETFs (SPY, IVV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

These adjustments reflect his ongoing refinement of the [[investment strategies for uncertain times | strategy]] to adapt to current market conditions.

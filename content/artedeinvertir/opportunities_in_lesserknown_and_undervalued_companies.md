Warren Buffett, often referred to as the Oracle of Omaha <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, suggests that investors with less than a million dollars should focus on [[benefits_of_investing_in_small_companies | smaller, lesser-known companies]] to find good investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:53:00">[10:53:00]</a>. He would be "fully invested" in such an environment if he had a small amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.

## Why Lesser-Known Companies?
Warren Buffett explicitly recommends investing in [[advantages_of_investing_in_smaller_lesserknown_companies | lesser-known companies]] because there is a higher probability of finding a cheap company with long-term benefits, even in an expensive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. Historically, Buffett himself built his fortune from scratch by selecting his own investments in these types of companies, as they offer greater potential for appreciation and are listed at more attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.

## Complementing Investment Strategies
While indexing (investing in large, famous companies) has been a strong and valid long-term strategy in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>, future performance from such investments is expected to be much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:25:00">[11:25:00]</a>. Therefore, a complementary strategy involves [[analyzing_stock_opportunities | selecting your own investments]] in lesser-known companies to gain greater control and potential for long-term appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:00">[11:35:00]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Investment Keys
Warren Buffett's four keys to successful stock market investing include:
*   Buying good businesses with growing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.
*   Acquiring them at [[investing_in_undervalued_sectors_amid_market_euphoria | attractive valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:00">[12:25:00]</a>.
*   Ensuring good management that treats shareholders well, provides dividends, or buys back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:26:00">[12:26:00]</a>.

### Valuation Discipline
A straightforward method to assess if a business is expensive or cheap is to compare its profits with its market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. Buffett is known for his extreme discipline in investment valuation, which significantly reduces risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>. Historically, for his top 10 investments, which contributed 80% of his wealth, he rarely paid more than 15 times earnings when initiating a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>, with the exception of Moody's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>. He prefers to hold liquidity and wait if he cannot find suitable investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a>.

The broader stock market typically trades at an average of 16 times earnings but is currently at 20 times earnings, which Warren Buffett considers expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.

## Abundant Opportunities for Private Investors
Warren Buffett's investment universe has significantly narrowed due to his immense wealth, allowing him to invest in only about 50 out of over 40,000 listed companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. However, for a private investor, [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | opportunities remain abundant]], even in the current market environment, making it easier to find lesser-known companies with greater growth potential and more attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

Unlike well-known companies like Nike or Starbucks, which have already experienced their high-growth cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:17:00">[14:17:00]</a>, small-cap valuations are currently the most [[investing_in_undervalued_sectors_amid_market_euphoria | undervalued and attractive segment of the stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:31:00">[14:31:00]</a>. They trade at approximately 12 times earnings, which is nearly a 40% discount compared to larger indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Eurostock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.

## Long-Term Vision
Economic crises are inevitable but should be viewed as [[investment_opportunities_in_volatile_market_conditions | opportunities]] for good investments with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:41:00">[15:41:00]</a>.

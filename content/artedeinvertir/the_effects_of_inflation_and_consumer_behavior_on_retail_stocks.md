The current market environment, characterized by rising [[Impact of inflation on the market | inflation]] and interest rates, marks "the end of an era" of easy money and central bank support for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This shift is having serious consequences for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, with [[Impact of inflation and interest rates on the stock market | interest rate movements]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> and liquidity setting the pace for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

## Inflation's Impact on the Economy and Market

Federal Reserve Chairman Jerome Powell has stated he will not "tremble for a moment to tackle [[Impact of inflation on global markets | inflation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>, even if it leads to job losses and an eventual recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This hawkish stance is driven by concerns over public approval ratings, which are at a minimum due to [[Impact of inflation on the market | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

Major companies like Walmart and Target have reported that the American consumer is being "drowned by [[Impact of inflation on the market | inflation]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, contributing to lower government approval ratings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Early figures from companies, often reliable thermometers of the economy, are pointing in a negative direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Historically, the Fed would intervene when the market dropped 15-20%, but this is no longer the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## The Retail Sector as an Economic Indicator

The retail sector serves as a crucial thermometer for American consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>, which accounts for 70% of the stock market's dependence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. Recent significant declines in retail stocks are therefore not surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Target's Performance and Challenges

Target, a high-quality retail stock that had seen significant growth in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:16">[00:42:16]</a>, experienced a substantial drop of 25% on a single day, followed by another 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>. This decline is mainly due to **margin problems**, rather than sales issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:39">[00:42:39]</a>.

Key challenges for Target include:
*   **Changing Purchasing Patterns**: Consumers are altering their buying habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>.
*   **Transportation Costs**: Increased costs for transporting goods, especially from China, have significantly impacted margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:50">[00:42:50]</a>. This is exacerbated by supply chain bottlenecks, such as those caused by lockdowns in Shanghai <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:15">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   **Inflationary Pressures**: Overall [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflationary pressures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a> have compressed profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:49">[00:43:49]</a>.

Retail companies typically operate with very low margins of 5-6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:54">[00:43:54]</a>. Even a 1% increase in costs can significantly reduce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:59">[00:43:59]</a>.

Despite these issues, Target expects to grow 2-5% in 2022, albeit with a lower profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>. Its long-term vision from 2023 onwards projects annual earnings per share growth of 6-9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>. Target has fallen 45% from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43">[00:45:43]</a>, mirroring a similar drop in the 2018 consumer panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>, and a 65% drop in the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Currently, Target is trading below its historical average valuation, making it relatively cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:08">[00:48:08]</a>.

### Costco's Resilience

Costco's business model is highly resistant to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>, similar to McDonald's, as it offers products at very low prices, making it attractive during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:58">[01:09:58]</a>.

Key aspects of Costco's performance:
*   **Crisis Resilience**: In the 2008 crisis, Costco's operating profits increased, only decreasing slightly in 2009 before rising again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Costco's stock has dropped 30% from its highs, falling from $600 to $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:33">[01:09:33]</a>. Its valuation has moved from 45 times earnings to 30 times, which is around its historical average of 29 times earnings over the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: No one, not even Amazon, can compete with Costco's business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:23">[01:10:23]</a>. Amazon, in fact, is reportedly pausing hiring and even firing staff to optimize its operations rather than focusing on growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>.

Costco is expected to grow 7-8% annually, potentially expanding its margins through scale and slight price increases on memberships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>. For long-term investors (30-40 years), Costco is considered a strong buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

## Other Retailers and Consumer Behavior

*   **Walmart and Target**: Both companies have stated that the American consumer is struggling due to [[impact_of_inflation_on_various_sectors | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Dollar Tree and Dollar General**: These high-quality businesses also experienced recent single-day drops, with Dollar Tree falling 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>.
*   **AutoZone**: This company also experienced a decline, despite not being directly impacted by the initial market correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:08">[01:35:08]</a>. Its valuation is now below its historical average, at only 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>.

The current market downturn is generalized, with many high-quality companies experiencing significant drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:13">[01:21:13]</a>. This suggests a widespread panic, rather than specific company problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:18">[01:21:18]</a>.

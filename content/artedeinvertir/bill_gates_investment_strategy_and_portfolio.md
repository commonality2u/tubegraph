### [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Economic Predictions and Concerns]]
In a February CNN interview, Gates highlighted his [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | economic predictions and concerns]], warning that the current global health crisis could persist longer than anticipated, leading to severe economic repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He emphasized that the global pandemic's prolonged nature is a primary risk to the economy in the coming months, primarily due to vaccine inequity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Reasons Behind Selling Shares]]

[[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates' recent investment activity]] reveals three key trends:

*   **Selling Technology Stocks**: He has divested from technology stocks such as Amazon, Google, and Apple, which were major beneficiaries of recent market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Selling Uber Shares**: Shares of Uber were sold due to their high valuation and fragility in an economic downturn, given their lack of profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. These types of Nasdaq tech stocks have recently experienced sharp declines, unlike more traditional stocks that maintained benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **Selling Alibaba Shares**: All shares in Alibaba, listed under ticker BABA, were sold at $225 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. Despite Alibaba being a strong growth company, recent regulatory challenges with the Chinese government caused investor panic and a sharp fall in its stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. Gates likely views this as a "tail risk"—an unlikely but high-impact event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

These moves suggest [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates is positioning himself for a "great rotation"]] of capital from disruptive or technological companies to more traditional and conservative companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. His strategy emphasizes defensive stocks that are more resilient during economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

Traded under ticker BRK.B at $250 per share, this investment reflects Gates' confidence in Buffett's ability to position the company to withstand various economic environments while delivering acceptable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is considered a very conservative and safe investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Waste Management (WM)

Listed under ticker WM at $115 per share, this company aligns with Gates' preference for traditional, crisis-resilient businesses with predictable performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The recycling market is projected to grow at 9% annually, benefiting the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### Walmart (WMT)
Gates has invested 9% of his portfolio in Walmart, the world's largest supermarket chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Trading under ticker WMT at $135 per share, Walmart is another example of a conservative company expected to perform well in any economic climate, offering moderate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Canadian National Railway (CNI)
Investment in Canadian National Railway, listed under ticker CNI at $115 per share, falls within the transportation sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. Railroad companies are considered among the safest investments due to their control over established transportation lines and the cost-competitiveness of rail for goods like raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

### Other Blue-Chip Holdings
Gates maintains high-quality "blue-chip" companies in his portfolio, including FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. These large-cap companies are known for stability and reliable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## New High-Growth Investment

The only new stock Gates has recently acquired is the American company Schrödinger, investing over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>. Listed under ticker SDR at $71 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

### Schrödinger (SDR)
Schrödinger is a highly innovative company using its technological platform to assist pharmaceutical companies in developing new drugs or vaccines more quickly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This company holds significant future growth potential, as the US medical research and clinical trials market alone is valued at $47 billion annually, while Schrödinger currently bills only $150 million per year despite growing over 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This investment, despite its high valuation (over 40 times sales) and lack of current profits, appears to be a very long-term play, potentially capturing a significant share of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This aligns with [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_vaccine_stocks | Bill Gates' interest in vaccine-related advancements]].

## [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates' Economic Predictions]]

Contrary to the widespread belief that economic normalcy might return by late 2021, [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates predicts a return to a normal state will occur in late 2022]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This more conservative outlook on the future economy is a primary driver behind the recent [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | changes to his investment portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

The world of the stock market and investments, though seemingly modern, has roots stretching back centuries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Despite the passage of time, certain fundamental aspects of market behavior have remained remarkably consistent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Enduring Characteristics

Even experiences from 100 years ago remain relevant, as the stock market has hardly changed in terms of its core psychology or mass behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. Similarly, a book written over 300 years ago, considered the first ever on the stock market, describes anecdotes that are still perfectly valid today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

The stock market is often described as a "manic-depressive entity" that can cycle between states of euphoria and depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. It is viewed not as a casino, but as a mechanism for generating long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.

## Key Concepts and Speculation

Historically, figures like Jesse Livermore, considered one of the best speculators of all time, demonstrated how market behavior, even during major events like the 1929 stock market crash, exhibits patterns that can be understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. His experiences from a century ago still resonate with today's market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

In the modern era, particularly from the 1960s and 70s, speculators like George Soros have further influenced the understanding of market dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Soros popularized the concept of "reflexivity in the markets," explaining how the price of an asset can directly influence its fundamentals and real-life behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. This idea helped to explain a phenomenon that many had previously struggled to capture or explain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>.

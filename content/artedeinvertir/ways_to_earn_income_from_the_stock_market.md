From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 
Many people often wonder if it's possible to [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | live off the stock market]] and achieve a predictable, increasing income over time. The answer is yes, but with certain nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>.

## Ways to Generate Income from Stocks

There are two primary ways to make money from [[stock_market_investing_strategies | stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

### 1. Revaluation
This is the most common method, involving buying a stock with the intention of selling it later at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
However, this method has drawbacks:
*   It relies on other investors being willing to pay more for your stocks in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
*   It typically provides less predictable and more volatile results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
*   While some stocks may be recognized for their value within six months, others might take two or three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### 2. Dividends
This method allows for a more predictable way to generate income from the [[stock_market_investing_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
Certain companies periodically distribute a portion of their profits to their shareholders as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.
The advantages of this investment method include:
*   Not depending on other investors to buy your shares at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
*   If the company is correctly analyzed for its ability to generate profits, it will distribute stable and growing dividends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
*   This leads to more predictable income, helping investors achieve targets like $100 or €100 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   Companies do not distribute 100% of their profits as dividends; a portion is reinvested, contributing to future revaluation of the stock in the longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Strategies for Dividend Investing

### Building a Diversified Portfolio
Academic studies suggest investing in at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It is also advisable for an [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | investment portfolio]] to contain between 15 and 20 shares that meet the profitability objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
Within a portfolio, some shares might increase dividends more than expected, while others might reduce them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Focus and Stability
With this [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | investment philosophy]], the focus shifts from daily stock market price fluctuations to the dividends the company will pay in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. If good companies with high profit generation capacity and dividend payment are selected, performance should be optimal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Finding High-Dividend Yield Stocks

To find companies that meet specific profitability objectives, a stock screener can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Recommended Tool: Investing.com
On Investing.com, navigate to the "tool" section and select "stock screener" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
Filters can be applied to find desired characteristics:
*   **Dividend Yield:** Set this filter between 6% and 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Dividends above 10% are often unsustainable, and below 6% would require significantly more capital to reach daily profitability goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth:** Limit the lower range to 0% to avoid companies that have reduced their dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Limit the upper range to 10% average annual growth, as aggressive growth with high current yield is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

Examples of companies found with these filters include:
*   AT&T (largest telecommunications company) with a 7% dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   Las Vegas Sands (casino company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.
*   Iron Mountain (document storage company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>.
*   Pexar Royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   CareDicker (nursing home company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

### Other Useful Tools
*   **Seeking Alpha (.com):** Useful for researching dividend stocks, specifically in the "dividends" section under "dividend growth" to see historical growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Market Screener:** In the "finance" section, you can monitor expected dividend payments for the next two years to ensure stability or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Required Capital for Income Target

To achieve an average daily profitability target of $100 or €100 (equivalent to $36,000 annually), a realistic dividend yield objective is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

A portfolio with an average dividend yield of around 7% is ideal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Calculation
The formula to determine the capital needed is:
`(Annual Income Target / Expected Portfolio Profitability) * 100` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

For an annual income target of $36,000 and a 7% portfolio yield:
`(36,000 / 0.07)` approximately `514,285` dollars.
The video gives `36,000 * 14 = 504,000` dollars, implying 1/0.07 is approximately 14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>.
Therefore, approximately $504,000 would be needed to reach the $100/day profitability target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This figure can be adjusted:
*   Increasing portfolio profitability reduces the capital needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
*   Decreasing the daily performance expectation (e.g., to $50) would halve the capital needed (around $250,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

## How Dividends Are Collected

Companies automatically send dividend payments to your third-party broker account where your shares are deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Payments can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Taxation of Dividends
Dividends are generally taxed between 20% and 25% in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
If dividends are received from outside your country of tax residence, a "withholding tax" or "double payment of taxes" may occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. In the United States, filing the W8BN form through your broker (like Interactive Brokers) can help avoid this double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

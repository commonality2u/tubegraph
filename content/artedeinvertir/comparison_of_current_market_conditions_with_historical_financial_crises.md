## The End of an Era: Easy Money No More

The era of "easy money" in the stock market, where central banks supported the market through various measures, appears to have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This era, particularly since 2008, was marked by central banks printing money, lowering rates (traction of the famous QE), or governments providing checks to citizens whenever problems arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This environment made every 15-20% correction an excellent buying opportunity because the market was flooded with money, leading to positive evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Historically, market rebounds were strong after central bank interventions like Quantitative Easing (QE), as seen in 2008, 2011, and between 2012 and 2014 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Even "Operation Twist," a coordinated action by American, Japanese, and European central banks, led to a new rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

However, this era is now ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Current Market Downturn: Causes and Characteristics

The market is currently in a new bearish phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This is primarily due to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's commitment to tackling inflation, stating he "will not tremble for a moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Despite concerns about a potential recession and job losses, the government is prioritizing combating inflation, partly due to low approval ratings linked to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Initial economic data, particularly from companies like Walmart and Target, indicates that the American consumer is "drowned by inflation," pointing towards a negative economic direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This contrasts with past behavior where the Fed would ease policy after a 15-20% market drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. As a result, the Nasdaq has fallen 30% from its highs, and the S&P 500 has fallen more than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

Concerns about inflation have increased, with recent inflation data showing an increase rather than a decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Financial condition indices are also at problematic levels due to high inflation and rising interest rates, similar to late 2020 or previous crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>.

## Historical Context: Central Bank Intervention and Market Cycles

Historically, central banks played a crucial role in preventing severe market corrections. Every time there were problems, central banks intervened by printing money or lowering rates, which often led to strong market rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The "buy the dip" strategy became fashionable, particularly in the last two years, as investors knew the central bank would intervene after a 5-10% market drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, this euphoria is now over because the "hot money" that entered the market, particularly in 2020 due to confinement, has begun to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

In all [[Lessons from historical stock market crises | bearish markets]] historically, significant capital outflows have preceded a market bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The market in the short and medium term is primarily driven by capital flows, with news often serving as an excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The previous bear market in 2018 was also marked by capital outflows, and the market only started to rise once these outflows stabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>.

## Waves of Bear Markets: A Pattern Repeated

The stock market operates in waves during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
1.  **First Wave:** Massive drops typically affect lower quality, most bubbling, and most expensive stocks (e.g., unprofitable, disruptive, internet, electric vehicle companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Many of these stocks have fallen 80-90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
2.  **Second Wave:** Bonds, which had a bubble, corrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
3.  **Third Wave:** Higher quality companies, tangentially related to technology, like FAANGs (e.g., PayPal, Netflix, Google), experienced declines, though less severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
4.  **Fourth Wave:** Cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin falling 50% from its highs and the Terra LUNA disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
5.  **Fifth Wave:** Even "untouchable" companies (generals of the market) like Coca-Cola, Walmart, Target, and Nike, considered very stable consumer companies, experienced significant drops, particularly in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This repeats the pattern of other bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The phases of a bear market progress from euphoria (bull trap) to initial falls (where "buy the dip" is common), then to a fear phase, and finally capitulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>. The capitulation phase is characterized by capital outflows, disillusionment, and selling at any price, potentially leading to extreme undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.

## Valuation Differences: Current vs. Dot-Com Bubble

A key difference between the current market situation and the Dot-com bubble of 2000 is the valuation of the top companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. In 2000, the top 10 Nasdaq companies, despite weighing 33% of the index, traded at an average of 75 times earnings at their peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. For example, Microsoft in 2000 traded at 65 times future earnings and 80 times current earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. When Microsoft dropped 50%, it was still trading at 25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

Currently, the average valuation of the top 10 largest companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook) is only 24 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. Google, for instance, is at 17 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. This means many large technology companies with significant index weight are already trading at a discount compared to the previous bubble, a 67% difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The Nasdaq fell 85% in the Dot-com bubble because of "obscene" valuations like Cisco at 130 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. The current market has not reached such levels of overvaluation, even for high-growth companies like Nvidia, which reached 30-60 times earnings before correcting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## Investor Behavior and Psychology

Many new investors entered the market in 2020 with "totally unrealistic expectations of performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. When these expectations are not met and the market begins to fall, capital starts to leave, and the "buy the dip" strategy ceases to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Retail investors doing short-term trading have seen their profits evaporate since January 2020, even though the market experienced one of its biggest bull runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This is because many pile in and buy at the worst moment of euphoria, especially in overheated stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

Conversely, astute investors like David Tepper and Ray Dalio pointed out that the tech bubble has already burst, which will have serious consequences for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. David Tepper, a widely admired investor, went short on the Nasdaq when it was high, and now that it has fallen almost 25%, he has closed that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>. He would consider buying the S&P 500 at 3,500 (10% below its current level at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

## Resilience of Quality Companies During Crises

Even high-quality companies like Apple or Google have not been saved from these bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. The market is currently experiencing a generalized fall due to panic, affecting even companies with strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.

*   **Target:** Experienced a significant 25% drop due to margin problems, mainly from transportation costs and inflationary pressures, not sales issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:36">[02:42:36]</a>. Its profit margin is compressed, but the company maintains a long-term vision of growing earnings per share by 6-9% annually from 2023 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>. It has fallen 45% from its highs, similar to the 2016-2017 consumer panic, and 65% in the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>. The key is to differentiate between temporary and permanent problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:32">[02:47:32]</a>.
*   **Micron:** A cyclical company in RAM memory manufacturing, highly affected by supply and demand dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>. Its profits are highly variable, and its stock price is correlated with RAM memory prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. Investing in such companies is safer when memory prices are in decline, and the stock has dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>.
*   **Energy Transfer:** An energy pipeline company that benefits from high transported volume, regardless of extreme oil price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:20">[02:58:20]</a>. It cut its dividend in 2014 due to high debt, but has since reduced debt, making the dividend more sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. It is well-positioned in gas transportation and liquefaction, benefiting from global demand shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>. Its valuation (5 times cash flow) is well below its historical average (15 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
*   **Costco:** Its business model is "hyper resistant to crises" because it offers very cheap products, making it attractive during downturns, similar to McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. In the 2008 crisis, its operating profits increased, only slightly decreasing in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. The stock has fallen 30% from its highs, returning its valuation to its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Nestlé:** A company with a strong competitive advantage, considered a "general stock" that falls in the later stages of a bear market when investors sell stable assets for liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. Its valuation has returned to its historical average of 23 times earnings, with expected annual growth of 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>.
*   **AutoZone:** Another "general stock" that experienced declines in the current market, despite its strong business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:03">[01:35:03]</a>. Its valuation is now below its historical average at 15 times earnings, and the risk of Amazon competition has dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>.
*   **SNT (Cintas Corporation):** A company with "hyper recurrent" business, meaning it has a stable and predictable revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>. Its profits grew even during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>.

## Lessons from Historical Data

*   **Bear markets are opportunities:** A bear market (S&P 500 falling over 20%) statistically happens every four years on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. However, there have been three bear markets in the last four years (2018, 2020, and the current one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>. Historically, every bear market has been an "excellent buying opportunity," with stocks recovering their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Positive returns after drops:** Every time the S&P 500 has dropped 15%, there have "always been positive returns" in the following 12 months in 90% of cases, with an average return of 18% (double the normal annual average of 9%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Long-term perspective:** It's important to differentiate between temporary and permanent problems for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:32">[02:47:32]</a>. Success in the stock market requires dissociating oneself from short-term news and negative messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Current Conditions

*   **Patience and long-term vision:** Investors who invested at the worst moments of previous downturns (e.g., 2018, early 2020) were in profit within a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and staggered buying:** It is wise to maintain liquidity and buy in stages during market downturns, rather than trying to perfectly time the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on fundamentals:** Invest in companies with strong business models that are expected to grow profits in the future, regardless of short-term market noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:46]</a>.
*   **Understand market psychology and capital flows:** These are the primary drivers of the market in the short and medium term, more so than specific news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Be brave during declines:** When assets are cheaper, it is a good time to be brave and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>.# Comparison of Current Market Conditions with Historical Financial Crises

## The End of an Era: Easy Money No More

The era of "easy money" in the stock market, where central banks supported the market through various measures, appears to have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This era, particularly since 2008, was marked by central banks printing money, lowering rates (traction of the famous QE), or governments providing checks to citizens whenever problems arose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Even "Operation Twist," a coordinated action by American, Japanese, and European central banks, led to a new rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

However, this era is now ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

## Current Market Downturn: Causes and Characteristics

The market is currently in a new bearish phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. This is primarily due to Federal Reserve Chair Jerome Powell's commitment to tackling inflation, stating he "will not tremble for a moment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Despite concerns about a potential recession and job losses, the government is prioritizing combating inflation, partly due to low approval ratings linked to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

Concerns about inflation have increased, with recent inflation data showing an increase rather than a decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Financial condition indices are also at problematic levels due to high inflation and rising interest rates, similar to late 2020 or previous crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:59">[02:33:59]</a>.

## Historical Context: Central Bank Intervention and Market Cycles

Historically, central banks played a crucial role in preventing severe market corrections. Every time there were problems, central banks intervened by printing money or lowering rates, which often led to strong market rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. The "buy the dip" strategy became fashionable, particularly in the last two years, as investors knew the central bank would intervene after a 5-10% market drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. However, this euphoria is now over because the "hot money" that entered the market, particularly in 2020 due to confinement, has begun to leave <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

In all [[Lessons from historical stock market crises | bearish markets]] historically, significant capital outflows have preceded a market bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The market in the short and medium term is primarily driven by capital flows, with news often serving as an excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. The previous bear market in 2018 was also marked by capital outflows, and the market only started to rise once these outflows stabilized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>.

## Waves of Bear Markets: A Pattern Repeated

The stock market operates in waves during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

2.  **Second Wave:** Bonds, which had a bubble, corrected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
3.  **Third Wave:** Higher quality companies, tangentially related to technology, like FAANGs (e.g., PayPal, Netflix, Google), experienced declines, though less severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.
4.  **Fourth Wave:** Cryptocurrencies, with Bitcoin falling 50% from its highs and the Terra LUNA disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
5.  **Fifth Wave:** Even "untouchable" companies (generals of the market) like Coca-Cola, Walmart, Target, and Nike, considered very stable consumer companies, experienced significant drops, particularly in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This repeats the pattern of other bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.

The phases of a bear market progress from euphoria (bull trap) to initial falls (where "buy the dip" is common), then to a fear phase, and finally capitulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>. The capitulation phase is characterized by capital outflows, disillusionment, and selling at any price, potentially leading to extreme undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:09">[01:16:09]</a>.

## Valuation Differences: Current vs. Dot-Com Bubble

A key difference between the current market situation and the Dot-com bubble of 2000 is the valuation of the top companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. In 2000, the top 10 Nasdaq companies, despite weighing 33% of the index, traded at an average of 75 times earnings at their peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:18">[00:35:18]</a>. For example, Microsoft in 2000 traded at 65 times future earnings and 80 times current earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:35:57]</a>. When Microsoft dropped 50%, it was still trading at 25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:15">[00:36:15]</a>.

Currently, the average valuation of the top 10 largest companies (Apple, Microsoft, Google, Amazon, Facebook) is only 24 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:38">[00:35:38]</a>. Google, for instance, is at 17 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>. This means many large technology companies with significant index weight are already trading at a discount compared to the previous bubble, a 67% difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:25">[00:36:25]</a>. The Nasdaq fell 85% in the Dot-com bubble because of "obscene" valuations like Cisco at 130 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>. The current market has not reached such levels of overvaluation, even for high-growth companies like Nvidia, which reached 30-60 times earnings before correcting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

## Investor Behavior and Psychology

Many new investors entered the market in 2020 with "totally unrealistic expectations of performance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. When these expectations are not met and the market begins to fall, capital starts to leave, and the "buy the dip" strategy ceases to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Retail investors doing short-term trading have seen their profits evaporate since January 2020, even though the market experienced one of its biggest bull runs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This is because many pile in and buy at the worst moment of euphoria, especially in overheated stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

Conversely, astute investors like David Tepper and Ray Dalio pointed out that the tech bubble has already burst, which will have serious consequences for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. David Tepper, a widely admired investor, went short on the Nasdaq when it was high, and now that it has fallen almost 25%, he has closed that position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:21">[02:27:21]</a>. He would consider buying the S&P 500 at 3,500 (10% below its current level at the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

## Resilience of Quality Companies During Crises

Even high-quality companies like Apple or Google have not been saved from these bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>. The market is currently experiencing a generalized fall due to panic, affecting even companies with strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.

*   **Target:** Experienced a significant 25% drop due to margin problems, mainly from transportation costs and inflationary pressures, not sales issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:36">[02:42:36]</a>. Its profit margin is compressed, but the company maintains a long-term vision of growing earnings per share by 6-9% annually from 2023 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>. It has fallen 45% from its highs, similar to the 2016-2017 consumer panic, and 65% in the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:47">[02:45:47]</a>. The key is to differentiate between temporary and permanent problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:32">[02:47:32]</a>.
*   **Micron:** A cyclical company in RAM memory manufacturing, highly affected by supply and demand dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:50">[02:48:50]</a>. Its profits are highly variable, and its stock price is correlated with RAM memory prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:38">[02:53:38]</a>. Investing in such companies is safer when memory prices are in decline, and the stock has dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a>.
*   **Energy Transfer:** An energy pipeline company that benefits from high transported volume, regardless of extreme oil price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:20">[02:58:20]</a>. It cut its dividend in 2014 due to high debt, but has since reduced debt, making the dividend more sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:01">[02:59:01]</a>. It is well-positioned in gas transportation and liquefaction, benefiting from global demand shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>. Its valuation (5 times cash flow) is well below its historical average (15 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.
*   **Costco:** Its business model is "hyper resistant to crises" because it offers very cheap products, making it attractive during downturns, similar to McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. In the 2008 crisis, its operating profits increased, only slightly decreasing in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. The stock has fallen 30% from its highs, returning its valuation to its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:30">[01:09:30]</a>.
*   **Nestlé:** A company with a strong competitive advantage, considered a "general stock" that falls in the later stages of a bear market when investors sell stable assets for liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:04">[01:33:04]</a>. Its valuation has returned to its historical average of 23 times earnings, with expected annual growth of 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:53">[01:33:53]</a>.
*   **AutoZone:** Another "general stock" that experienced declines in the current market, despite its strong business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:03">[01:35:03]</a>. Its valuation is now below its historical average at 15 times earnings, and the risk of Amazon competition has dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:56">[01:35:56]</a>.
*   **SNT (Cintas Corporation):** A company with "hyper recurrent" business, meaning it has a stable and predictable revenue stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:07">[01:37:07]</a>. Its profits grew even during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>.

## Lessons from Historical Data

*   **Bear markets are opportunities:** A bear market (S&P 500 falling over 20%) statistically happens every four years on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>. However, there have been three bear markets in the last four years (2018, 2020, and the current one) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a>. Historically, every bear market has been an "excellent buying opportunity," with stocks recovering their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.
*   **Positive returns after drops:** Every time the S&P 500 has dropped 15%, there have "always been positive returns" in the following 12 months in 90% of cases, with an average return of 18% (double the normal annual average of 9%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:53">[00:33:53]</a>.
*   **Long-term perspective:** It's important to differentiate between temporary and permanent problems for a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:32">[02:47:32]</a>. Success in the stock market requires dissociating oneself from short-term news and negative messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Current Conditions

*   **Patience and long-term vision:** Investors who invested at the worst moments of previous downturns (e.g., 2018, early 2020) were in profit within a couple of years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and staggered buying:** It is wise to maintain liquidity and buy in stages during market downturns, rather than trying to perfectly time the bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on fundamentals:** Invest in companies with strong business models that are expected to grow profits in the future, regardless of short-term market noise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:46">[01:43:46]</a>.
*   **Understand market psychology and capital flows:** These are the primary drivers of the market in the short and medium term, more so than specific news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>.
*   **Be brave during declines:** When assets are cheaper, it is a good time to be brave and invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:41">[01:44:41]</a>.

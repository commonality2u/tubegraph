In late 2020, as concerns about a new financial crisis in 2021 emerged, renowned investor [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] urged the government to act immediately to prevent further economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. His appeal came amidst worsening conditions and investor panic over a new variant of the "current problem" which could transmit faster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Context of the Crisis
The economic situation was further complicated by new economic stimulus measures approved in the U.S., which amounted to approximately $900 billion, a figure significantly lower than the market's expectation of double that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This shortfall was a critical factor to monitor, as the Federal Reserve and these stimulus measures had been crucial for the economic recovery throughout 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Buffett's Direct Appeal
[[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]], known for his generally moderate public statements, broke his silence to press the American government to increase these stimulus efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. In an interview with CNBC, he expressed strong concern regarding the situation:
> "Congress is in the process of ruining the dreams of thousands of people. Congress needs to act now. We need another injection of money to complete the job. Congress is currently debating, and I hope they extend the PP program on a large scale to allow people to see the light at the end of the tunnel" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

Buffett emphasized the immense importance of providing liquidity to both families and corporations during times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Investment Advice in Uncertain Times
Despite the market euphoria and high valuations seen in late 2020, Buffett's perspective on liquidity and government action remains relevant. While he does not recommend being "100% waiting for opportunities" due to inflation eroding capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>, his call for stimulus highlights the need for a stable economic foundation.

The advice for investors in 2021 included maintaining liquidity (10-30% of the portfolio) to capitalize on inevitable market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>, investing only in companies thoroughly analyzed and understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>, and observing the positioning of major investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. This contrasts with the specific stimulus-driven need for government intervention.

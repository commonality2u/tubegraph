The [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]], developed by [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | George Soros]], is a concept that has significantly contributed to his wealth and understanding of [[financial_market_dynamics_and_predictions | financial market dynamics]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. While many investment concepts are derived from figures like Warren Buffett, Soros's unique approach, merging philosophy and investment, has yielded spectacular results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Since founding his fund in 1970, he has achieved average annual returns of 25% over 45 years, notably without major losses during [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | crises]] such as 1987, 1990, the dot-com [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | bubble]], 2008, and 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## George Soros's Background and Investment Evolution

[[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | George Soros]] was a Hungarian refugee from World War II who, with falsified papers, managed to reach the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. With a certain level of income, he gained access to the London Business School, a highly respected institution where he trained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. His true passion lies in philosophy, and he counts Karl Popper as one of his mentors, a background that influenced his [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

After graduation, Soros faced difficulties finding a job due to a xenophobic society, taking on jobs like door-to-door sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He eventually entered the [[financial_market_dynamics_and_predictions | financial world]] through a Hungarian contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Initially, he started as a value investor, focusing on cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. His philosophy evolved over time, seeking areas where he could generate more profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. He gained a reputation for identifying cheap German stocks in the 1950s and 60s, particularly those with dual stock structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. His successful reports led to client support, enabling him to found his company, initially with just $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This fund, later known as the Quantum Fund, grew organically to manage assets exceeding $30-$40 billion, illustrating the power of compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## The Theory of Reflexivity

Soros's book, "The Alchemy of Finance," published in 1988-1989, details his [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. It is a complex read requiring a deep understanding of finance and investment experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. The theory explains how he moved beyond just stock investing to speculating in currencies, indices, and raw materials like gold and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

At its core, the [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]] asserts that the [[financial_market_dynamics_and_predictions | financial system]] is a human construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. Unlike natural phenomena (e.g., weather), [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | financial crises]] cannot be predicted reliably because if they could, they would not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. The economy is too complex to forecast due to a multitude of unpredictable factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

Soros emphasizes that understanding the economy's future is less important than understanding the perception that [[role_of_investment_funds_and_private_investors_in_market_dynamics | investors]] will have of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. [[financial_market_dynamics_and_predictions | Financial markets]] are a "common mentality" created by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This concept relates to quantum theory, where the observer influences the observed element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In [[financial_market_dynamics_and_predictions | financial markets]], if participants formulate a vision, they influence the market itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. For example, if an [[role_of_investment_funds_and_private_investors_in_market_dynamics | investor]] believes markets will fall and acts on that belief, their actions contribute to the fall, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

Soros argues that the [[market_dynamics_and_investment_strategies | theory of efficient markets]] is flawed because participants act based on emotions, feelings, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. Markets are not stable; they are always unstable and biased upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### Boom and Bust Patterns

The [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]] seeks to identify patterns in large rises and falls, often referred to as [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | bubbles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

Soros illustrates a typical reflective process:

*   **Initial Perception Shift**: The red line represents perception, not necessarily economic reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The blue line represents the price of assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. In a first period, people begin to perceive something as a good investment (e.g., housing in Spain in the late 90s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The stock market initially lags but then tends to rise much faster than the underlying fundamentals suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
*   **The "Test" Period**: In all [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | bubbles]], there's a test period where prices stabilize or even fall slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. If this fall isn't too abrupt and people gain confidence that it's a buying opportunity, prices can rally again, often higher than the initial peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Reinforcement Loop**: One thing reinforces another <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. For example, rising oil prices can modify the reality and fundamentals of oil-related stocks by increasing orders and benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. This is contrary to the traditional view that the stock market anticipates events; Soros states that market participants produce changes in reality or perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **New Paradigm and Disconnection**: A [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | bubble]] reaches a "new paradigm" where prices become completely disconnected from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. The dot-com [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | bubble]] is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.
*   **Irreversible Fall**: At this point, small changes or news can trigger enormous, irreversible falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. Even as prices plummet, fundamentals may still show inertia from previous capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>. This period is dangerous because "bargain hunters" may misinterpret the fall as an opportunity, thinking the previous rally will repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

## Examples of Reflexivity in Practice

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | crisis]], marked by the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, saw the S&P 500 plummet by 58% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. However, in March 2009, the market began to rise based on small news items, presentations, results, and capital injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Despite companies presenting weak results through the first three to four quarters of 2009, the market experienced an incredible rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

This demonstrates reflexivity: the market did not anticipate the recovery but rather helped produce it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. [[role_of_investment_funds_and_private_investors_in_market_dynamics | Investors]], central bankers, and corporations, seeing the S&P 500 rise from its lows, regained confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>. They started investing in capital expenditures, making new investments, and corporations bought back shares, believing "the worst is over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>. Central bankers also injected liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. This renewed confidence and investment stimulated the economy, allowing credit to flow and returning things to normal, even though the actual GDP contraction was not disastrous (2.3% in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>.

### Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs)
A more recent example involves Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Around two years ago, as housing prices began to recover, SOCIMIs were listed on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. They started trading at a premium (e.g., 1x or 2x book value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>. This allowed the REITs to issue new shares at a premium and use that capital to buy assets in the private market at or below book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

This process automatically boosts earnings per share (EPS), creating a virtuous circle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. For example, if a SOCIMI earning 1 euro per share issues shares at 1.2 times book value to acquire assets at 1x book value, its EPS increases even if more shares are issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>. [[role_of_investment_funds_and_private_investors_in_market_dynamics | Investors]] perceive this as a "new paradigm" where SOCIMIs are seen as growth companies, driving their share prices even higher (e.g., 1.3 or 1.4 times book value), further improving the benefits of subsequent capital increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:17]</a>.

However, a recent period of market downturn (e.g., Ibex fall) has dragged down these shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. When SOCIMIs issue capital now, trading at 0.8 times book value, it has the opposite effect: earnings per share decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. This situation, according to Soros's theory, means they should not be a spectacular investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:57">[00:21:57]</a>.

## Implications for Investors

Soros utilizes the [[george_soros_and_the_theory_of_reflexivity | theory of reflexivity]] for both speculation and self-protection against certain events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. For investment funds, this means being cautious that growth companies in their portfolios finance their growth through cash flow and retained earnings, rather than relying on capital increases that can generate "vicious circles" as seen with the SOCIMIs in a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>.

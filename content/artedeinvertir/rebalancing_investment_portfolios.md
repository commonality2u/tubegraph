Rebalancing is a crucial practice in [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | managing an investment portfolio]], ensuring that assets maintain their intended allocation. It is a core component of successful [[investment_strategy_and_asset_allocation | investment strategies]], such as the All Weather Portfolio devised by Ray Dalio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## What is Rebalancing?
Rebalancing involves adjusting a portfolio back to its original asset allocation weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. Over time, different assets within a portfolio will grow or shrink at varying rates, causing their proportions to drift from the initial target. Rebalancing corrects this drift, bringing the portfolio back into alignment with its desired risk and return profile.

## The Role of Rebalancing in Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio
Ray Dalio, one of the world's most successful [[investment_funds_and_portfolio_management | investment fund managers]], designed the All Weather Portfolio to perform well in all economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. A key element of this [[portfolio_management_and_investment_education | portfolio management]] system is its simplicity and minimal effort requirement, primarily involving annual rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

The recommended rebalancing frequency for the All Weather Portfolio is every 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. This ensures that the assets return to their original, recommended weights, which are designed to withstand various "economic seasons" (high growth, low growth, accelerating inflation, disinflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Psychological Aspect of Rebalancing
Adhering to a rebalancing schedule requires discipline and the necessary psychology to follow the established plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It's common for investors to modify their [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment methods]] based on short-term results, which can undermine the long-term effectiveness of a disciplined strategy like the All Weather Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. The portfolio's high resistance to volatility and quick recovery times—such as recovering losses from the 2008 crisis in under seven months, compared to four years for the American stock market—highlight the benefits of sticking to the plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Current Portfolio Adjustments
While Ray Dalio continues to use his core All Weather Strategy for [[investment_funds_and_portfolio_management | investment funds]], he has been implementing certain [[changes_in_ray_dalios_investment_strategy | changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. As his portfolio is publicly accessible, even for small investors, these adjustments can be observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

Recent [[analysis_of_current_portfolio_adjustments_by_famous_investors | analysis of his portfolio]] indicates three primary [[changes_in_ray_dalios_investment_strategy | adjustments]]:
1.  **Reduced Bond Allocation**: He has slightly decreased the weight allocated to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
2.  **Increased Gold Allocation**: A portion of the redirected capital has gone into increasing the weight of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. His gold allocation through ETFs like GLD now exceeds 15%, double his original recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.
3.  **Increased International Stock Allocation**: He has also increased exposure to stocks, specifically from international countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, including emerging markets like India, Brazil, and Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

These adjustments reflect a dynamic approach to [[investment_strategies_in_changing_economic_conditions | investment strategies in changing economic conditions]] and [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment strategies in a changing economic landscape]], even within a robust framework like the All Weather Portfolio.

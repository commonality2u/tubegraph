Ray Dalio has highlighted [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | economic inequality]] as a significant risk to both the economy and the stock market in the coming years, potentially leading to a situation even worse than the 2008 crisis or resembling the Great Depression of 1929 where the market fell 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Current State of Wealth Inequality

Analysis of wealth distribution in the United States reveals a growing disparity:
*   The wealthiest 1% in the U.S. have increased their share of national wealth from 10% to over 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   Conversely, the poorest 50% of the U.S. population (approximately 200 million people) have seen their share of national wealth decrease from 20% to less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Consequences of Growing Inequality

These shifts in wealth distribution carry several implications:
*   **Rise of Populist Politics** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>: Increased inequality can lead to the rise of politicians with populist or communist leanings.
*   **Negative Economic Impact** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>: Such political shifts can result in:
    *   Higher taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>
    *   Increased regulations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>
    *   Greater difficulty in doing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>
    *   Overall negative effects on the economy and stock market shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Historically, periods of high poverty, such as during World War II, led to significantly higher taxes (e.g., 90% rates), and the period from 1938 to 1950 experienced "20 lost years of market" due to high taxes and a challenging business environment, demonstrating the negative impact on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. This trend is currently observed in many countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

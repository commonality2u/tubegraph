Central banks have stated that an [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | economic recession]] is imminent in the first quarter of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. Specifically, an [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | economic recession]] is projected for the Eurozone, and the United States faces a "quite imminent" danger of recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

## Central Bank Actions and Economic Impact

The Central Bank surprised markets by indicating that interest rate hikes are not yet over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. They plan to increase rates by 0.5% in probably each of the next three meetings, aiming to reach 4% for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The market had not yet priced in these anticipated increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This policy directly influences downward valuations in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, as the risk-free rate (e.g., 10-year bond) will begin to reflect this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

Furthermore, a significant withdrawal of liquidity from the system is underway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. A monthly withdrawal of $15 billion began in March, practically reversing previous actions by the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. This withdrawal profoundly impacts economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The market was most influenced by statements from the Central Bank's Thursday meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

## Key Economic Indicators and Forecasts

Several [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | economic recession indicators]] support the central banks' forecasts:
*   **New Industrial Orders (United States)**: A reliable indicator for past recessions (2000-2001, 2008, 2020), this metric is currently in the "danger zone" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.
*   **Housing Affordability (United States)**: Due to rising interest rates, the ease of purchasing housing is at levels seen before the 2007-2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. The real estate sector significantly impacts the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Conditions are also expected to become more complicated in Europe with rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.
*   **Consumer Savings and Indebtedness**: The excess savings generated during COVID-19 lockdowns have been depleted, primarily due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Personal savings are at levels seen during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Furthermore, household indebtedness (credit cards, personal loans, mortgage debt) is quite high, exacerbated by rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. Consumption, which accounts for 70% of the economy, contracts when people lack savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in a New Era (Howard Marx's Perspective)

Howard Marx, an influential investor whom Warren Buffett admires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, believes the current environment represents a "transcendental change" in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He has witnessed only two such profound changes in his 53 years of experience, and he considers the present the third <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. The shift is largely due to the reversal of the money-printing era by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. The S&P 500's performance was closely linked to the Central Bank's balance sheet expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, and now this balance is expected to normalize over the next two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

Marx identifies four major shifts in investment strategies that are unlikely to work as they did in the past 13 years (since the 2008 crisis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>:

### 1. Passive vs. Active Investing
The period post-2008 saw a significant rise in passive or indexed investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Capital flowed massively into passive funds while active funds experienced outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. [[Michael Burrys recession prediction | Michael Burry]] has repeatedly warned about the dangers of passive indexing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. While index investing may perform well long-term, short-term disappointment is possible if performance expectations are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### 2. Growth vs. Value Investing
Recently, the "growth style" of investing, particularly in unprofitable companies that issued shares to finance losses, outperformed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This peaked in 2021 with the euphoria around stocks like Beyond, Peloton, Palantir, Shopify, and Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This "dirtier" or less pure growth is deemed unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. In contrast, "value investing" involves buying companies for less than their worth, focusing on profitable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. Historically, value strategies become cheap during market shifts, such as in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### 3. Small Caps vs. Large Companies
Historically, small-cap companies have provided higher returns than large companies due to less analyst coverage, lower liquidity, and greater growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. While small caps peaked relative to large companies in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, the subsequent 13 years have been a struggle for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. For instance, the Russell 2000 (small cap index) rose 50% over almost 10 years, averaging 4-5% annually, while the S&P 500 (large cap index) doubled, growing 9-10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. Historically, small caps returned 11-12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. A potential recovery in small caps could signify another major shift, especially as they are currently cheaper than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### 4. United States vs. International Markets
In recent years, the U.S. market has significantly outperformed the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The S&P 500 had a 230% return over 12 years, compared to very poor performance (around 50% over 10 years, ~4% annually) in European or emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Howard Marx now proposes the opposite trend, where international stocks perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. U.S. valuations are significantly higher (e.g., 15 times earnings as a historical average) compared to the rest of the world, which trades at a 25-30% discount (e.g., 10 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Sector Performance During Recession and Recovery

During a recession, certain sectors perform better or worse, with market anticipation playing a role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>:
*   **Discretionary Consumption**: These sectors (e.g., cars) tend to do well during a recession because the market anticipates their strong recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Technology and Industrial Companies**: These sectors tend to perform poorly as the economy contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
*   **Energy**: This sector has performed well due to energy inflation, which is partly causing the current recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **Rebound Period**: Most sectors perform well during the subsequent recovery, except for traditionally "safer" sectors like healthcare, energy, and utilities, which do not suffer as much during crises and thus benefit less from the rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Divergences and Company Characteristics

The transcript provides several examples to illustrate the paradigm shifts and market dynamics:

*   **Grupeggin (Small Cap, Europe) vs. J Maki (Large Cap, Europe)**: Both companies produce plastic packaging for the food sector. Grupeggin is a smaller company (370 million market cap), less covered by analysts, with stable, predictable growth (5% annually) and low debt (0.5x EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. J Maki is 10 times larger, with more liquidity and index inclusion, growing at a similar rate (6% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Despite similar earnings per share and debt levels, J Maki trades 60% more expensive than Grupeggin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This highlights the valuation divergence between small and large caps.
*   **GDI (Small Cap, Canada) vs. Compass Group (Large Cap, Europe)**: GDI provides building maintenance services and is resilient to crises, growing at 20% annually with aligned management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:53">[00:29:53]</a>. It has a small trading volume and is not in major indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. Compass Group, a global giant in the same sector, grows slower (6% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>. Compass Group capitalizes $30 billion and is in major European indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>. GDI is valued significantly lower (e.g., 9x EBITDA) compared to Compass Group (12x EBITDA), despite GDI's higher growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>.
*   **Globan (U.S.) vs. Nagarro (Germany)**: Both are digital engineering companies. Globan is a large U.S. company (7 billion market cap) that was in many growth indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. It grows 30% annually, with profits at 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. Nagarro is a smaller German company, not in U.S. indices, and has grown more this year (40-35% vs. Globan's 60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Globan is valued almost double Nagarro (e.g., 30x vs. 11x EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25">[00:35:25]</a>. This shows the U.S. market premium and index effect.
*   **Berry Global (Value Investing example)**: This industrial packaging company is considered a "bored" sector but shows consistent results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. It has grown sales by 11% and profits by 17% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Despite strong performance and buying back shares due to perceived undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>, its P/E ratio has compressed from a normal 15x-17x to 8x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. This exemplifies value investing where solid businesses are undervalued due to market sentiment.
*   **Other Examples**:
    *   **Flatex de Giro**: A low-cost broker whose business can suffer if retail investors withdraw funds during a market drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:00">[00:43:00]</a>.
    *   **Tesla**: Despite a significant drop from its highs, its valuation (28 times earnings) remains at a considerable premium compared to other car manufacturers (6-7 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>. It faces demand problems and new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:31">[00:46:31]</a>.
    *   **Go Easy (Canada)**: A company providing personal loans. Despite concerns, its business model is less cyclical than perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:22">[00:47:22]</a>. In Canada, unemployment benefits and a more stable "blue-collar" job market for its clients limit default rates compared to the U.S. subprime mortgage crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:38">[00:51:38]</a>.
    *   **Regional Management (U.S.)**: Similar to Go Easy, it showed growth in operating profit during the 2008-2010 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:33">[00:54:33]</a>.
    *   **Accuvest**: A bank that had losses and diluted shares during the 2008 banking crisis, but saw profits recover by 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:16">[01:27:16]</a>. In a more normal crisis (2001-2002), its earnings per share grew or remained stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:48">[01:29:48]</a>.
    *   **Customers Bank**: A regional U.S. bank, estimated to grow and currently trading at 4 times P/E compared to a normal 8-10 times, despite decent ROE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:18">[01:31:18]</a>.
    *   **Wide Back**: A well-regarded regional bank in the U.S. that has grown sales 16% and profits 20% annually, trading at P/E 13, but historically lower during good buying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:06">[01:32:06]</a>.
    *   **PayPal**: Like many tech stocks, facing negative sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:49">[01:33:49]</a>.
    *   **Alibaba, Tencent**: Chinese stocks that have gained investor confidence after auditors were allowed to review financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:14">[01:35:14]</a>.
    *   **Xiaomi**: A Chinese stock that has fallen due to overall negative sentiment towards Chinese stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:31">[01:36:31]</a>.
    *   **Sangoma**: A small-cap Canadian company in telecommunications cloud systems, trading at very low valuations (e.g., 3x Free Cash Flow) despite growth and subscription-based model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:32">[01:17:32]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | market volatility]] and economic situation, influenced by [[federal_reserves_plan_and_economic_recession | Federal Reserve's plan and economic recession]] forecasts, presents a "new era" for investing. While past strategies may no longer apply, this period is seen as an opportune time for long-term investors to learn and identify bargains, as major money is made during periods of fear and market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>. Investors should focus on understanding individual companies rather than generalizing market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:20">[01:19:20]</a>, recognizing that even in negative years, some companies can appreciate in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:31">[01:19:31]</a>. Historically, bear markets last one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>, and recovery is often strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>.

One of the best investors of all time, Staly Druen Miller, has been repositioning his portfolio in anticipation of the economic and stock market scenario for 2025. His strategy involves abandoning certain sectors where he foresees problems and shifting towards attractively valued sectors expected to perform better [00:00:10]. Miller is known for being consistently ahead of the market, having achieved positive returns in 100% of the years he has operated [00:00:33]. His success stems from a combination of studying [[impact_of_macroeconomic_trends_on_investment_decisions | macroeconomics]] and interpreting it through his investment decisions [00:01:34].

Miller's personal fortune exceeds $5 billion, and his current stock portfolio is valued at over $3 billion, having generated a 30% annual return for 30 years [00:01:10].

## Miller's Five Working Premises for 2025

Miller's strategy for the next 12-24 months and 2025 is based on five key premises:

1.  **Euphoria in Certain Sectors:** There is euphoria in specific stock market sectors, leading Miller to sell shares in these areas [00:01:54].
2.  **Fed Rate Cuts:** Miller believes the Federal Reserve (Fed) will lower interest rates due to a weakening economy [00:02:04].
3.  **Dollar Depreciation:** The dollar is expected to decrease in value due to extensive money printing and the fiscal deficit [00:07:32].
4.  **Persistent Inflation:** [[impact_of_economic_indicators_and_inflation_on_investment_decisions | Inflation]] is expected to remain high [00:07:42].
5.  **Investment in Undervalued Sectors:** He is repositioning his portfolio towards undervalued sectors that do not have as much direct correlation with Artificial Intelligence [00:01:02].

## Market Adjustments and Sector Rotation

Miller has initiated a "great rotation," moving away from large, more technological companies towards other sectors that have been overlooked by the market and are more undervalued [00:04:31].

### Selling Tech Stocks
Miller has begun selling off large tech stocks, including:
*   **Nvidia:** Reduced position by 87% [00:02:22]. Miller was an early investor, multiplying his money by six or seven times with the company [00:02:27]. He perceives significant euphoria around Artificial Intelligence companies, which he identifies as a danger in the stock market [00:02:36].
*   **Microsoft:** Reduced position by 63%, getting rid of over 700,000 shares [00:02:57].

[!INFO] Warning Signs in AI Sector
Problems have surfaced in the Artificial Intelligence sector, with companies like Supermicro experiencing significant drops due to delays in publishing annual reports, which can often signal accounting irregularities [00:03:11]. [[economic_risks_and_investment_strategies | Stock market bubbles]] are often characterized by an increase in fraud as companies attempt to distort results to meet expectations [00:03:45].

### Impact of Central Bank Policies and Currency Fluctuations

Miller anticipates that the Fed lowering rates will stimulate the economy and benefit dividend stocks, which tend to appreciate when interest rates drop [00:11:35].

A weakening dollar, which has already begun to occur (dropping 5-6% recently) [00:08:08], is a key factor in Miller's investment strategy. He states, "Let's not forget that we have printed more than 8 trillion dollars, I can't be bullish on the dollar" [00:08:15].

The weakening dollar has several implications for investments:
*   **International Stocks:** International stocks, particularly from Europe and Japan, tend to perform best when the dollar is declining [00:08:36].
*   **Emerging Countries:** [[impact_of_economic_indicators_and_inflation_on_investment_decisions | Emerging countries]] often hold significant dollar-denominated debt, so a weaker dollar relieves pressure on their accounts, benefiting them [00:08:48].
*   **US Industrial Companies:** US industrial companies that export benefit when the dollar depreciates, as repatriated profits in stronger currencies increase their overall profits and stock value [00:09:11].
*   **Commodities:** Most commodities have a negative correlation with the dollar's value, meaning their price tends to rise when the dollar falls [00:09:52]. Gold, silver, aluminum, sugar, and oil exhibit this inverse relationship [00:10:06].

## Key Investments Reflecting Miller's Outlook

Miller's current portfolio rebalancing reflects his predictions regarding the economy, interest rates, and the dollar.

### 1. Kinder Morgan (Oil & Gas Pipeline)
*   **Investment:** $91 million of his personal money [00:11:17].
*   **Rationale:** This leading US oil and gas pipeline company stands to benefit from several factors aligning with Miller's outlook:
    *   [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | Oil prices]] tend to rise with [[impact_of_economic_indicators_and_inflation_on_investment_decisions | inflation]] [00:10:46].
    *   Oil prices benefit from a falling dollar [00:10:49].
    *   Fed rate cuts stimulate the economy, increasing oil and gas consumption [00:10:50].
*   **Competitive Advantage:** New environmental protection policies limit new pipeline permits, giving companies like Kinder Morgan with existing infrastructure a strong competitive position and potential for rising transportation prices [00:12:01].
*   **Industry Trends:** Natural gas consumption is increasing significantly due to its low pollution and cost-effectiveness, especially with shale gas technology in the US [00:12:17]. The US is exporting vast amounts of natural gas, requiring extensive pipeline transport to coastal export facilities [00:13:48].
*   **Financials:** The company has doubled its profits per share from $0.66 to $1.22 despite stock market declines [00:12:49], reduced its debt leverage [00:12:53], and returned capital to shareholders through dividends and buybacks [00:13:02]. It is currently trading at a valuation (10 times profits) significantly lower than its historical average (15-20 times) [00:16:57].

### 2. American Apartments (Real Estate)
*   **Investment Type:** A real estate investment company focused on luxury apartments in demographically favorable US states like Texas, Florida, and Atlanta [00:24:03].
*   **Rationale:** This investment aligns with expectations of falling rates, a weak dollar, and [[impact_of_economic_indicators_and_inflation_on_investment_decisions | inflation]]:
    *   **Lower Rates:** Real estate companies benefit significantly from lower interest rates as it reduces interest expenses, increases property valuations, and makes dividend stocks more attractive compared to bonds [00:25:16].
    *   **Weak Dollar/Inflation:** Real estate assets historically perform well and protect against inflation, with property values in dollars expected to rise if the dollar's value declines [00:25:47].
*   **Market Dynamics:** Housing supply is limited in its target markets, while demand is rising due to population migration from higher-tax states [00:26:16]. Lowering rates is expected to further boost demand [00:26:29].
*   **Financials:** The company boasts a strong dividend payout history and has increased profits since 2020 despite rising interest rates [00:24:53]. Its debt leverage is very low (28% of total assets), and nearly 95% of its debt is at a fixed, low interest rate (3.6%) [00:27:17]. Profits are expected to grow solidly from 2025 onwards after a slight dip in 2024 [00:28:12]. The company is trading at 13 times earnings, below the sector's usual 16-20 times [00:28:33].

### 3. Woodward (Industrial/Aviation Parts)
*   **Investment Type:** A company manufacturing highly specialized parts for aviation (e.g., control sticks, pedals, sensors, fuel management systems) and industrial sectors [00:29:21].
*   **Rationale:** Aviation is a consistently growing sector, and the company benefits from a strong maintenance component providing recurring income [00:29:29].
*   **Growth Potential:** Woodward expects high single-digit organic growth (8-10%) from 2023-2026, plus acquisitions and potential margin expansion [00:30:03]. New airplane models incorporate more of the company's advanced components, leading to higher content per aircraft [00:31:50]. Woodward expects its aviation line to grow at 12%, double the market's general growth [00:32:08].
*   **Defensive Qualities:** The company's results remained flat during the 2008 crisis, indicating a defensive stock [00:30:43]. It is projected to double in size by 2026, with an impressive earnings per share growth of 14-18% annually, which is higher than the expected growth for companies like Microsoft or Google [00:32:24].
*   **Valuation:** While trading at 28 times earnings, it is considered cheaper than alternatives in other sectors with even lower growth, making it an attractive high-quality business [00:32:52].

### 4. Coherent (Specialized Industrial Components)
*   **Investment:** Miller's largest current position, totaling $260 million [00:33:12].
*   **Investment Type:** Manufactures highly specialized industrial components, including measuring lasers, thermal imaging, and other niche market applications [00:33:48].
*   **Rationale:** The company operates in niche markets, leading to high profit margins and growth [00:34:04]. It expects very high growth in its final sectors (electronics, telecommunications, industrial) through 2028, with an overall expected growth of over 14-15% [00:34:09].
*   **Miller's Philosophy Applied:** Miller emphasizes that the present doesn't drive stock prices; the future does [00:34:37]. Coherent's earnings per share have recently dropped due to companies' fear of investing in fixed assets and projects [00:34:46]. However, Miller sees this as an opportunity, anticipating a recovery as fears subside and rates drop [00:35:40].
    > "I learned in the 70s from my mentor when I was starting out in the stock market and I was a list of chemical stocks. The question is when should you buy for example chemical stocks on the stock market and he says the belief on Wall Street is that you should buy companies when earnings and profits are good and he says really this is not a good time to buy them when earnings are good because what do they do when these companies have high profits? Well, they go out and expand capacity then three or four years later there is excess capacity and these companies are losing money. What happens when the opposite happens when they are losing money, well, they have stopped building new capacity, so within three or four years the capacity will have been reduced and the profit margins will have increased a lot and that will make the companies go up on the stock market, okay. And above all he says therefore we always have to imagine what the world will be like in 12 to 24 months to 2 years." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:49">[00:35:49]</a>
*   **Industrial Sector Recovery:** The US manufacturing index, after a period of contraction due to rising rates, is showing signs of expansion [00:37:46]. This recovery, likely accelerated by rate drops and inflation normalization, will benefit industrial sectors and companies like Coherent [00:39:00].
*   **Financial Outlook:** Coherent's profits are expected to decrease in 2024 but then grow again in double digits, potentially tripling earnings per share [00:39:26]. This anticipated future growth makes the company attractive despite current lower earnings [00:40:01].

## General Investment Advice

Miller's approach emphasizes foresight and contrarian thinking:
*   **Anticipate the Future:** Focus on what the world will be like in 12-24 months, rather than the present [00:36:41].
*   **Avoid Euphoria:** Do not buy when "everyone else is investing in, where there's euphoria, you're buying at the worst possible time" [00:37:06].
*   **Look for Undervalued Opportunities:** Invest in stocks that are cheap because they are currently experiencing a downturn or slow growth, but are poised for future improvement due to underlying factors [00:37:28].

By studying top investors and applying advanced techniques, individual investors can achieve high returns and accelerate wealth generation, potentially reaching financial goals sooner than through traditional savings or index fund approaches [00:18:32]. This involves leveraging knowledge and applying strategies that can generate returns uncorrelated with the general market movement [00:21:56].

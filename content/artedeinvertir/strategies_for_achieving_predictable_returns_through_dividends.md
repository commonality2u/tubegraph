From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

Many individuals inquire if it's possible to sustain oneself from the stock market and achieve a predictable, increasing income over time. The answer is affirmative, but with specific considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Ways to Generate Income from Stocks

There are two primary methods to make money from stocks in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

### Revaluation
This common method involves buying a stock with the intention of selling it at a higher price in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The challenge with this [[investment_methods_revaluation_and_dividends | investment method]] is its dependency on other investors being willing to pay more for the shares in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This approach often leads to less predictable and more volatile results, as market recognition of a stock's value can take anywhere from six months to several years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.

### Dividends
A second, more predictable way to generate income from the stock market is through dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Certain companies regularly distribute a significant portion of their business profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The advantage of this [[investment_methods_revaluation_and_dividends | investment method]] is that it does not rely on future investors buying shares at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Instead, income is generated by selecting companies with a strong ability to generate profits and distribute stable, growing dividends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This approach offers more predictable income and can help achieve specific daily profitability targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. Companies typically reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business, which can also lead to future revaluation of the stock in the longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Portfolio Composition for Dividend Investing

To achieve profitability objectives, academic studies suggest diversifying an [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment portfolio]] across at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It is also advisable for the portfolio to contain between 15 and 20 shares that meet the desired profitability criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. When constructing a portfolio, it's important to view it as a whole, understanding that some shares may exceed dividend expectations while others may fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. A key benefit of this [[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | investment philosophy]] is that investors do not need to constantly monitor the stock market price; the focus remains on the company's ability to generate profits and pay consistent dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Finding Dividend Stocks

Identifying suitable shares among the vast number listed on the stock market requires specific tools and filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Recommended Free Tool: Investing.com Stock Screener
The website "investing.com" offers a useful free stock screener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Dividend Yield Filter**: Set this between 6% and 10%. Yields above 10% are often unsustainable, while lower yields might require significantly more capital to meet income goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth Filter**: Limit the low range to 0% to avoid companies that have reduced their dividends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Set the top limit to 10% average annual dividend growth, as aggressive growth alongside high yield is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

This screener can identify interesting companies such as the telecommunications company AT&T (with a 7% dividend), the casino company Las Vegas Sands, and the document storage company Iron Mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. It can also be applied to various global regions like Spain, Europe, Latin America, or Canada, where companies like Pixor Royalties and Extendicare might appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Other Useful Tools
*   **Seeking Alpha**: Useful for researching dividend stocks, specifically for reviewing historical dividend growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. For example, Altria has historically grown its dividends by an average of 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Market Screener**: Provides information on expected dividend payments for upcoming years, allowing investors to monitor for stability or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Calculating Capital Needed for Target Income

To determine the investment capital required for a specific income target (e.g., $100 or €100 per day), consider the following:

*   **Annual Income Target**: $100/day equates to $3,000/month or $36,000/year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
*   **Realistic Dividend Yield**: An achievable target is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. While some safer companies might offer 3-4% (requiring more capital), and others might offer 10-12%, the latter are often unstable and prone to dividend cuts during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. An ideal portfolio would aim for an average dividend yield of around 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>, composed of 15-20 diversified stocks across different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Formula**: Divide 1 by the expected portfolio profitability (as a decimal) and multiply by the annual target benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
    *   Example: For a 7% yield and $36,000 annual target: (1 / 0.07) * $36,000 ≈ $514,285.
    *   Rough calculation given: (1 / 7%) * $36,000 = 14 * $36,000 = $504,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
*   **Variables**: The required capital depends on the expected daily performance and the portfolio's return-generating capacity.If the portfolio's profitability increases, less capital is needed. Similarly, if the average daily performance expectation is decreased (e.g., to $50/day), the capital needed is halved (e.g., ~$250,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

### Collection Process
Companies automatically transfer dividend payments to the investor's third-party broker account where shares are deposited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Payments can occur monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Tax Implications
Dividends are typically taxed between 20% and 25% in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Receiving dividends from outside one's country of tax residence can lead to "withholding tax" or double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. While recovering this double taxation can be complex in many countries, in the United States, the W-8BEN form (offered by many brokers like Interactive Brokers) can prevent it, ensuring dividends are received without that capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

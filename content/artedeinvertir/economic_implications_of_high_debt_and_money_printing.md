Renowned investor Ray Dalio has warned that a new world economic order is emerging, which he considers one of the biggest economic and social reforms in decades. This shift is expected to have serious [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | implications for both the stock market and the economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Dalio specifically cautioned that this scenario could lead to a major crisis in the US and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Insights
Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, manages 100 billion dollars and is often called the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the high reliability of his economic and stock market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He is also a respected author and speaker, participating in events like the World Economic Forum in Davos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

### The Great Economic Cycle
Dalio explains that history follows a "great cycle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The current world order began in 1945 after World War II, establishing the dollar as the world reserve currency and leading to a period of peace and prosperity under a dominant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, this is now poised to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Political extremism in the US is only accelerating this transition to a new world economic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Through historical study, Dalio found that every dominant economy, like the US for the last 70 years, experiences two distinct phases: economic rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The US is currently entering a phase of decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Characteristics of Economic Decline
This phase of decline is primarily characterized by:
*   A high level of debt in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   The printing of money in alarming quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   Leading to [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | economic and social inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

In contrast, countries like China are still in the upward phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Money Printing and its Consequences
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve has printed record amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet surged from one trillion dollars to over seven trillion dollars, far exceeding general economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

This economic experiment is already impacting the real economy, with [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] levels not seen in decades and significant price increases for raw materials, products, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Ray Dalio highlights the "helicopter money theory" as an example of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. In 2020, the US government sent $1,200 checks to citizens to stimulate consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, Dalio argues that if printing money were the solution to economic problems, countries like Zimbabwe would be the wealthiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Historically, this economic strategy has led to ruin in countries that attempted it, such as Germany, Argentina, Venezuela, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Growing Economic Inequality
Another concern raised by Dalio is the extreme level of economic inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For example, just three individuals (like Jeff Bezos) accumulate more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The wealthiest 1% of the American economy has continuously prospered over the last 40 years, accumulating increasing levels of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Historically, this social inequality leads to three serious economic problems affecting savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:
1.  **Rising Taxes**: Taxes are expected to increase in the US and globally, as seen in Joe Biden's proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This negatively impacts the stock market by decreasing company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions**: The Federal Reserve has indicated future interest rate increases, which will negatively affect highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
3.  **Increased Regulation and Wealth Redistribution**: New regulations and measures aimed at redistributing wealth would negatively affect almost any type of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Protecting Savings and Investments
Ray Dalio advises against selling everything and holding liquidity in an [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflationary scenario]], as the value of money will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Instead, he recommends being strategically invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Based on Ray Dalio's investment philosophy, which aims to perform well in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>:
*   **Stocks**: Have at least 40% of the investment portfolio in stocks, as they tend to perform well in this new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.
    *   **Energy Sector**: According to a Bank of America study covering 50 years of the stock market, the energy sector is expected to perform best in an environment of rising [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
        *   *Example*: Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, a large oil and energy producer, is attractive due to its low valuation (4 times EBITDA compared to a historical average of 6 times) and excellent dividend growth over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. If Dalio's scenario materializes, its value could rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
    *   **Raw Materials Sector**: Also expected to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Ray Dalio recommends holding at least 10% of a portfolio in gold or related investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. He states that the present increase in money supply always decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth towards financial assets, historically raising the price of gold and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Since March 2020, gold has risen from $1,500 to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
    *   *Ways to Invest in Gold*:
        1.  **Gold ETFs**: Buy an ETF that reflects the future performance of gold, such as GLD (ticker for the largest gold ETF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. European versions like iShares (GN) are also available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
        2.  **Gold Mining Companies**: A more complex option due to operational risks, but with higher potential upside if gold prices rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Investing in a group of these companies through an ETF like GDX can mitigate individual company risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Personal Defense Products**: One stock that would perform well in a scenario of social inequality is a manufacturer of personal defense products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   *Example*: Taser International (AXON) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Since 2008, its shares have appreciated from $6 to over $75 due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. The stock trades at an attractive valuation of 11 times this year's earnings, with a historical average of 16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. In Dalio's proposed scenario, its potential could be much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Biggest Risk
Ray Dalio identifies the biggest risk, which investors should monitor closely, as the bankruptcy of governments after economic shocks, particularly when accompanied by large amounts of economic inequality and class differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. After studying over 50 conflicts and revolutions, he observes that government bankruptcy is the most important advanced indicator of wars and revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He warns that this risk is not immediate, but if the economy continues its current trajectory, it could reach an inflection point with severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

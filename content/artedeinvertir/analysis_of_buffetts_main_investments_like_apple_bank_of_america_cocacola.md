Warren Buffett, often called "the Oracle of Omaha," is considered the greatest investor of all time, managing a portfolio of listed shares valued at over $240 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. After months of caution and selling shares due to the recent crisis, Buffett has regained confidence and is making significant purchases, including one acquisition exceeding $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

Thanks to stock market transparency rules, Buffett is periodically required to declare his share purchases, sales, and main investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This public disclosure allows other investors to gain insights into his strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Buffett's approach typically involves waiting for quality companies with predictable and increasing income to trade at attractive valuations, often due to temporary, solvable problems or because the market overlooks them in favor of trending investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>. He aims for an average annual return of over 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>.

## Accessing Buffett's Portfolio Information

To find information on Warren Buffett's investments:
*   **Official Way**: Visit the U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) website and search for Berkshire Hathaway (Buffett's holding company). Look for document 13 EFE, which is filed quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>. This document can be difficult to understand for new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Alternative Way**: Use websites that process this information and present it in a more understandable format, such as Way Wisdom (.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

## Recent Portfolio Adjustments

### Sales
Warren Buffett has recently reduced his exposure to American banks, selling shares in companies like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and PNC Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. This suggests he is not optimistic about the banking sector's prospects for 2021, although he maintains a significant investment in one American bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:00">[02:52:00]</a>.

### Purchases â€“ Focus on Pharmaceuticals
Buffett's recent investments have primarily focused on pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol Myers, Merck, and AbbVie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. His interest stems from the sector's attractive valuation not seen in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>.

Historically, pharmaceutical shares traded at high valuations due to their excellent business models and long-term prospects, driven by an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. However, during the Trump administration (2016-2020), the sector faced pressure due to continuous threats of new regulations that could reduce profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. With Donald Trump's defeat and the incoming democratic administration planning heavy investment in the health sector, this threat has dissipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. This leaves behind robust businesses resistant to economic crises, with profits that have doubled over the last five years and good growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

#### Bristol Myers (BM)
*   **Investment**: $1.8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: BM (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.
*   **Price**: $61 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Overview**: Excellent market position in oncology and cardiovascular problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. Shares have multiplied by over 30 times in the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>. Highly resistant to economic crises; expected to grow 6% in 2020 compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>.
*   **Earnings**: Confirmed earnings of over $6 per share for 2020, with a forecast of over $7 per share for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Historically, the pharmaceutical sector trades at 20 times earnings. Conservatively valuing Bristol Myers at 15 times its projected $7 earnings per share for 2021 yields a target price of over $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. This implies over 60% appreciation potential in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. Over the next five years, the value could triple to between $150 and $200+ per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>.

#### AbbVie (ABBV)
*   **Investment**: Over $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: ABBV (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Price**: $100 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>.
*   **Overview**: Leadership position in the pharmaceutical sector with a strong track record of value generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Unaffected by the 2020 crisis, with profits expected to increase compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>.
*   **Financials**:
    *   Revenue: Increased from $25 billion to over $50 billion in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.
    *   Profit Margins: Consistently over 40% operating profits on sales, higher than even Coca-Cola's 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
    *   Earnings Per Share (EPS): Grew from $4.80 to over $12 for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Conservatively valued at 15 times its projected $12 EPS, the one-year value could reach $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. In five years, the intrinsic value could exceed $300 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a>.

### Berkshire Hathaway Share Buybacks
*   **Investment**: $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: BR (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>.
*   **Price**: $230 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.
*   **Reason**: Buffett and Charlie Munger believe Berkshire Hathaway shares are trading below their real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>. By buying back shares, they aim to reduce the number of shares outstanding, increasing the ownership percentage and value per share for remaining shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance**: Aggressive buybacks in 2011, 2016, and 2019 have historically led to good stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Core Portfolio for 2021

Buffett's top six investments comprise 80% of his portfolio, indicating high conviction in these holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:29:00">[22:29:00]</a>.

1.  ### Apple Inc.
    *   **Investment**: Over $109 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:29:00">[11:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio %**: 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Ticker**: PL (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Price**: $117 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Overview**: One of the best businesses listed on the stock market, multiplying by over 100 times in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:45:00">[11:45:00]</a>.
    *   **Buffett's Entry**: First invested in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>, investing $20 billion at $25 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:33:00">[12:33:00]</a>. At that time, investors underestimated Apple's future growth potential due to its size, leading to an attractive valuation of just 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Performance**: Since Buffett's initial investment, shares have multiplied by 5 times, generating over $80 trillion in profit for him and shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:00">[12:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Current Valuation**: Demanding at nearly 30 times earnings, but justified for a high-quality company with future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

2.  ### Bank of America
    *   **Investment**: Over $24 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio %**: Over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Ticker**: VE (USA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:00">[13:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Price**: $26 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:15:00">[13:15:00]</a>.
    *   **Overview**: One of the four major American banks controlling an oligopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:18:00">[13:18:00]</a>. Post-2008 financial crisis, surviving banks enjoy higher returns on invested capital and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>. Despite reducing exposure to other banks, Buffett maintains high conviction in Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Buffett's Statement**: He feels "very comfortable" with the banks in his portfolio, finding them "very attractive stocks" compared to others. He states that banking is a good business if "you don't do absurd things with the assets," noting their portfolio banks earn 12-16% on their tangible book value, which is favorable compared to a 30-year bond yielding only 2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Trades below its historical average at just 12 times earnings, considered an attractive valuation with good prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.

3.  ### Coca-Cola
    *   **Investment**: Over $19 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:42:00">[14:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio %**: Over 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
    *   **Ticker**: KO (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>.
    *   **Price**: $52 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Overview**: Buffett's investment strategy for Coca-Cola resembles his recent pharmaceutical and Apple investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. He invested during a temporary problemâ€”the "New Coke" fiasco over 20 years ago, which caused sales and profits to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:00:00">[15:00:00]</a>. When the company rectified and reinstated the original formula, Buffett seized the opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:14:00">[15:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Performance**: Since his first investment, Coca-Cola shares have multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:27:00">[15:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Confidence**: Buffett has publicly declared he will "never sell a share of Coca-Cola" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Currently trading at 25 times its historical average earnings, a valuation fully justified for such a high-quality business with future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. Considered suitable for conservative investors due to low debt and crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:00">[15:53:00]</a>.

4.  ### American Express
    *   **Investment**: Over $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio %**: Over 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Ticker**: XP (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:29:00">[16:29:00]</a>.
    *   **Price**: $110 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.
    *   **Overview**: A high-quality business characterized by high profit margins, high return on invested capital, and good future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. Operates in an oligopoly with Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:49:00">[16:49:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Trades at an attractive valuation. Estimated to earn over $10 in EPS for the next 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:56:00">[16:56:00]</a>. Historically traded at over 20 times earnings, which would imply a target price above $200 per share in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. This would double Buffett's money in five years, equivalent to an average annual return of over 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:16:00">[17:16:00]</a>.

5.  ### Kraft Heinz
    *   **Investment**: Over $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:48:00">[17:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio %**: Over 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:52:00">[17:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Ticker**: KHC (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:55:00">[17:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Price**: $32 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:59:00">[17:59:00]</a>.
    *   **Overview**: World-renowned for sauces and food products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:01:00">[18:01:00]</a>. One of the few investments where Buffett is currently suffering losses, having invested over five years ago at $80 per share, with shares dropping over 50% since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:07:00">[18:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Buffett's Mistake**: He publicly stated his main mistake was paying a very high price based on the company's profit-producing capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:19:00">[18:19:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of not investing at any price, regardless of how good a company is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Challenges**: Kraft Heinz has a high debt level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:47:00">[18:47:00]</a>. Its products have become less popular due to new healthier eating trends, leading to slightly decreased income and pressure on the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:52:00">[18:52:00]</a>.
    *   **Why Buffett Holds**: He maintains his position likely because the company is now trading at a very interesting valuation multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation (EV/EBITDA)**: For consumer companies with high debt, EV/EBITDA is a more suitable valuation ratio as it accounts for debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a>. Kraft Heinz's historical average valuation is around 14 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:36:00">[19:36:00]</a>. It is currently trading below its historical average at 10 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. With reduced debt and stabilized revenue/profits, it may return to its historical average, implying a target value of $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:57:00">[19:57:00]</a>.

6.  ### Moody's Corporation
    *   **Investment**: Over $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:19:00">[20:19:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio %**: Over 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:23:00">[20:23:00]</a>.
    *   **Ticker**: MC (US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>.
    *   **Price**: $270 per share (at time of video) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Overview**: Represents Buffett's ideal investment type: a company with a dominant market position, little affected by crises, high profit margins, and predictable earnings per share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:31:00">[20:31:00]</a>. It is expected to grow even in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:49:00">[20:49:00]</a>. Moody's controls the oligopoly of debt rating agencies along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:56:00">[20:56:00]</a>. These companies have the power to raise prices for clients annually due to lack of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:03:00">[21:03:00]</a>. It's an unregulated sector, contributing to exceptional stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Historically traded at around 25 times earnings, which is its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:23:00">[21:23:00]</a>. In the last five years, EPS has grown over 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:31:00">[21:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Future Prospects**: Assuming this growth rate continues, Moody's could earn around $20 per share in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a>. Multiplying this by its historical 25 times earnings valuation yields a target price of $500 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:49:00">[21:49:00]</a>. This represents a 100% return potential, equivalent to Buffett's target of 15% average annual compound return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:56:00">[21:56:00]</a>.

The remaining 20% of Buffett's portfolio is more diversified across a greater number of stocks, but they follow the same pattern: quality stocks resistant to crises and bought at reasonable valuation multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:39:00">[22:39:00]</a>. These include stocks such as Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, McDonald's, or Da Vita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:52:00">[22:52:00]</a>.

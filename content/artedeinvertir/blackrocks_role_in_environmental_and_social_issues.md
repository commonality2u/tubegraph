BlackRock is a company commonly described as the "owner of the world" due to its tremendous power and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It controls more than $10 trillion in assets and has become the largest shareholder in the main listed companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. To put its size into context, these assets represent over 10% of the world economy, exceeding the GDP of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

Many sources directly accuse BlackRock of causing damage to the environment, social inequality, or financial fraud due to the significant power and control it exerts over companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>.

## [[the_growth_and_power_dynamics_of_blackrock | Growth and Power Dynamics]]

BlackRock is led by Larry Fink, who is considered one of the people with the greatest economic power globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The company's objective, like any private company, is to make profits from the funds provided by its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Most of its clients are banks, insurers, pension plans, or sovereign funds from some of the world's richest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Importantly, small investors also contribute, making it very likely that part of your savings are directly or indirectly involved with BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

BlackRock controls the financial sector, holding majority positions in major banks worldwide, including Wells Fargo, Banco Am√©rica City Group, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Paradoxically, many of these banks are also BlackRock's main clients, providing it with more money to increase its controlling position over global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. If you have an investment plan offered by banks, your money has likely ended up in BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Even money deposited in a bank without direct investment can be invested by the bank, potentially ending up in BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

BlackRock uses "Issers" as its commercial name to channel investments and own companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This name frequently appears among the main shareholders of large banks like JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

## [[influence_and_control_of_blackrock_in_the_global_economy | Influence and Control]]

The power of BlackRock is so significant that the Federal Reserve commissioned it to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bernstein during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. BlackRock extends its influence beyond rich economies, acting as one of the main lenders to emerging countries, thereby exercising control over these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The company earns 80% of its income by advising on financial products like Icers (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. These ETFs made it easy for the general public to invest in the entire market, with an estimated 60% of invested money in the United States now being passive investments in products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This investment style concentrates power, as people buying BlackRock products delegate voting rights to BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This creates "circular structures" where client funds give BlackRock more power over key financial entities, which in turn provide more funds, increasing its global power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Along with Vanguard, BlackRock controls over $15 trillion in assets, which rivals the American economy ($23 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. These two companies are the main shareholders of 85% of the world's main listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

## [[potential_conflicts_of_interest_in_industries_controlled_by_blackrock | Potential Conflicts of Interest]]

### Industry Control and Competition
The accumulation of power by BlackRock generates potential conflicts of interest regarding competition among different companies controlled by a single entity like BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, while BlackRock may not be a main shareholder in McDonald's, it is a main shareholder in McDonald's competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This situation, where the same company controls major players within a sector, raises questions about the freedom of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This pattern is observed across various sectors, including the automobile, airline, and financial industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

### Auditing Division
BlackRock has a controversial division called "BlackRock Solutions" which audits and controls potential risks that major banks globally may pose to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This division grants BlackRock access to the intimate internal accounts and data of these banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This is seen as paradoxical, given that BlackRock is simultaneously the main investor in these banks and responsible for controlling their internal risks, leading to concerns about self-control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. BlackRock states that these are two separate companies with "Chinese walls" for information control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Influence on Media and Environmental Policy

BlackRock also exercises its power in the media sector, which is crucial for controlling public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It is estimated that BlackRock controls 95% of traditional and New Generation media, such as Facebook, where it appears as one of the largest shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

In 2021, driven by public opinion pressure, BlackRock used its significant power over the companies it controls to pressure ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, to reduce its CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. ExxonMobil subsequently committed to achieving net zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

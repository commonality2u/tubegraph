The emergence of a [[the_new_world_economic_order | new world economic order]], as warned by famous investor [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]], is expected to have significant implications for the global economy and various asset classes, including [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This new order is considered one of the largest economic and social reforms in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]]'s Perspective

[[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]], who manages Bridgewater Associates with over $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a> and is known for his accurate economic predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, highlights that [[gold_as_a_safe_investment_in_uncertain_times | gold]] is an [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment]] that is expected to perform well if this [[the_new_world_economic_order | new world order]] materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. He recommends allocating at least 10% of an [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investment]] portfolio to [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]]-related [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.

### Impact of Money Printing
[[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] states that the printing of money invariably decreases the value of bonds and shifts wealth towards financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Historically, this trend has consistently led to an increase in the price of [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. For instance, since March 2020, when governments began printing substantial amounts of money, [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]]'s price rose from $1,500 to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Investing in [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | Gold]]

There are two primary methods for [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investing]] in [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]]:

### 1. [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | Gold]] Exchange-Traded Funds (ETFs)
The simplest way to invest in [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] is by purchasing a [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] ETF that tracks the metal's future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **GLD:** The largest [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] ETF globally, traded on the stock exchange under the ticker GLD at a price of $169 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. It has shown excellent performance since the acceleration of money creation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.
*   **iShares (GN):** For European [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investors]], there are European versions of [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] ETFs, such as iShares, trading under the ticker GN at 30 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.

### 2. [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | Gold]] Mining Companies
Investing in [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] mining companies is a more complex option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. This approach requires not only predicting the price of [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] but also navigating the operational complexities of mining businesses, which can present unforeseen challenges like floods, landslides, or strikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. However, if these companies perform well and [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] prices rise, these [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investments]] can see significantly higher gains than the price of [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

To mitigate the individual operational risk associated with a single [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] mining company, [[investment_strategies_in_a_changing_economic_landscape | investors]] can opt for an ETF that represents a group of [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **GDX:** In the US, the largest ETF representing [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_nonus_stocks | gold]] mining companies is listed under the ticker GDX, trading at $34 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

[[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio | Bill Gates]], one of the world's richest and most powerful individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, appears to be preparing for a new crisis by acquiring shares in vaccine-producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This represents a significant shift in his [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio changes | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His movements and statements are closely monitored by millions of international investors due to his accurate vision of the economy's future and stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Approach

[[Bill Gates]] played a crucial role during a recent crisis, having warned about the likelihood of a pandemic and the world's unpreparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. His deep understanding of the biotechnology sector also allowed him to predict which company would first develop a successful vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. With a fortune exceeding $100 billion, built from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, his investment acumen is well-known, even if many people associate him more with founding Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

## Radical Shift in Investment Strategy

Recently, [[Bill Gates' investment strategy and portfolio | Bill Gates' investment portfolio]] has been made public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. His movements suggest he is preparing for a crisis akin to the one experienced in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He has radically changed his [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio changes | investment strategy]], concentrating 70% of his investments in just three companies that produce vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This new [[Bill Gates investing strategies | investment strategy]] has led many investors to question whether it reflects a negative outlook on the ongoing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Investment Transparency

In the United States, stock market transparency rules mandate that institutional investors with over $100 million in assets periodically report their share purchases and sales to the American regulator (SEC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This allows for insight into Bill Gates' economic and stock market vision through his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

[[Bill Gates]] utilizes two primary investment vehicles:
*   A fund for more traditional and safer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   The portfolio of the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, which is the focus of his new [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

Currently, three stocks—BioNTech, CureVac, and Vir Biotechnology—constitute over 70% of his foundation's investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These companies are at the forefront of developing "second-generation vaccines," which are expected to be more sophisticated and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

## Why Second-Generation Vaccines?

In an interview with CNN, [[Bill Gates]] emphasized the need for richer countries to provide sufficient, quality vaccines to poorer nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. He warned that variants would return to wealthier countries if the problem wasn't addressed quickly enough, necessitating the development of these second-generation vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

Investing in biotechnology companies during their development phase carries high risk and volatility, requiring a high level of knowledge for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, successful ventures can yield significant financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. For example:
*   **BioNTech**, in collaboration with Pfizer, was the first company to develop an effective vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Its shares rose from $90 to over $350 after successful clinical trials were announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.
*   **Moderna** saw its shares surge from $70 to over $400 in less than 12 months, positioning itself as a leading vaccine developer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Favorite Vaccine Stocks

### BioNTech (BNTX)

[[Bill Gates]] began investing in BioNTech (BNTX) in late 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>, just six months before the crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. His initial $50 million investment is now valued at over $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. BioNTech, alongside Pfizer, launched the first effective vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The company anticipates a demand of one million doses per year from 2022 onwards, suggesting this business could become recurrent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For the current year, BioNTech is estimated to earn over $37 per share, trading below 10 times earnings, which is an attractive price for a biotechnology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. If the business proves recurrent, shares could more than double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### CureVac (CVAC)

[[Bill Gates]] invested in CureVac (CVAC) in 2015 with a $50 million investment, now valued at over $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. CureVac, a German company like BioNTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, is collaborating with large companies, specifically GlaxoSmithKline, on second-generation vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. CureVac is a more speculative and volatile investment as it is in the development phase and not yet profitable, heavily relying on the success of its clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Vir Biotechnology (VIR)

[[Bill Gates]] demonstrated good judgment by investing in Vir Biotechnology (VIR) in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This highly innovative company is developing an effective solution against multiple variants, including the Delta variant, with effectiveness levels exceeding 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. An additional factor that might have drawn [[Bill Gates' investment strategy in vaccine stocks | Bill Gates' interest]] is its development of an inhaled vaccine solution, eliminating the need for injections and potentially increasing public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Like CureVac, Vir Biotechnology is in the development phase and not yet profitable, making it a highly speculative and risky investment, though with the potential for high rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## The Core Reason for Investment

In an interview with CNBC, [[Bill Gates]] articulated his primary reason for significant investment in this sector:
> "We will only return to normal when we have not the first generation of vaccines but the next generation of vaccines. The good news is that there are a large number of companies working to achieve this second generation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

These statements, combined with his recent portfolio movements, indicate which companies are best positioned to develop the next generation of vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. As seen with companies like Moderna or BioNTech, developing effective solutions that benefit humanity can also generate high returns for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

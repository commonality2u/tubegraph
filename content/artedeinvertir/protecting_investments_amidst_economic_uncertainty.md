The global economy is facing a new and significant scenario that is expected to affect everyone, regardless of whether they invest in the stock market or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. An economic disaster is potentially approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Warnings from Janet Yellen

Janet Yellen, the current director of the American Treasury and former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve (an entity that manages over four trillion dollars annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, has warned about the approaching economic instability. She has stated that failure to find a solution in the coming weeks could lead to irreversible damage to the American economy and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Yellen even suggested this could mean the total collapse of the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. She has indicated an exact date when a significant change could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>, with terrible consequences for both stocks and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Yellen has described putting an arbitrary debt ceiling and periodically creating self-manufactured crises that risk the financial and economic system, especially during a recovery, as "tremendously irresponsible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Initial Measures Taken

To address the immediate crisis, Yellen has initiated desperate measures. Since the United States is at its debt limit, the Treasury has begun to significantly cut investments in pension and health plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Investments by the government for employee retirement plans have also been suspended, with resumption only if the debt problem is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. These measures represent a spending cut of over 200 billion American dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## The Debt Ceiling Problem

The core issue stems from the United States spending more money than it earns, resulting in a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. To finance this spending, new debt is issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For many years, a limit has been established on how much debt the US can incur, and this limit is about to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

### Market Indicators: Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

Financial markets are already pricing in a potential US bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are insurance policies against a country's government debt default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. A higher risk means a higher price for these insurance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The price to insure American government debt has multiplied by over nine times, indicating an "enormous" risk of the United States defaulting on its debt for financial markets and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Consequences of a US Debt Default

A default on US debt would be akin to "gravity ceasing to exist," leading to total chaos and financial collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. This is because the entire global financial system is interconnected with American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. US debt bills and bonds constitute the largest asset class internationally, currently standing at 30 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Many entities and individuals worldwide hold massive amounts of these treasury bills and bonds, as they were historically considered the safest investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect, impacting banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans that have invested heavily in it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This scenario would be similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but "multiplied by 30 times" due to the significantly higher balance of total US debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Impact on Asset Classes
If a default occurs:
*   **Dollar bonds and fixed income** would collapse, as investor confidence would be lost, leading to enormous capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The value of **stocks and equity investments** would fall sharply, with a few exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   The price of **gold** would likely rise sharply, as its value is measured against the American dollar, providing a safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

### White House Projections
The White House has published a report detailing potential consequences, including over 2 million job losses and an additional annual cost of over 750 billion dollars in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. It highlights that the dollar and stock market would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The White House estimates potential stock market drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

## A "Comical" Solution: The Trillion-Dollar Platinum Coin

The most viable solution is an agreement between Republicans and Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. However, desperate solutions are being proposed, including minting a "trillion-dollar platinum coin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This seemingly Hollywood-esque solution is real, existing due to a legal loophole in American law that allows the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. The idea is to create coins with an extraordinary value of one trillion dollars, deposit them with the Federal Reserve, and allow the government to use these funds to continue paying expenses and interest on debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

While this could work in the short term, it would not send a message of stability to financial markets, leading to continued falls in the value of the dollar, bonds, and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Janet Yellen has warned that the adopted extraordinary measures are temporary and likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, indicating the collapse could be just weeks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

## [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | Strategies for Protecting Investments During Economic Downturns]]

In the face of this new risk, many investors are adopting [[how_to_protect_investments_during_economic_changes | strategies to protect their investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Some are beginning to bet against US government debt and the stock market, anticipating historic falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

Here are some [[investment_strategies_for_uncertain_times | investment strategies for uncertain times]]:

*   **Gold**: As previously mentioned, gold would benefit significantly in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
*   **Gold-related stocks**: Companies in the gold sector, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would likely benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: Large investors, like Ray Dalio, who have access to sophisticated products, could buy CDS to protect against default risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs**: These exchange-traded funds increase in value when the market goes down, as they hold investments in derivatives that bet against the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. However, it's important to remember that these instruments have historically performed poorly in the long term because the stock market tends to revalue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Investors typically use them tactically for short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. An example is the ProShares Short S&P500 (SH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## Historical Precedent

This debt limit scenario has been reached before, in 2011 and 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Although temporary solutions were found in those instances, the markets experienced high volatility in the subsequent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

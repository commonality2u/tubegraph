From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

The ongoing situation regarding the occupation of Ukraine has transitioned into a significant "economic war" phase, which is expected to affect everyone, regardless of their involvement in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Finance ministers have already warned about the substantial [[impact_of_russia_ukraine_conflict_on_global_economy | economic consequences]] of the measures being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Potential Geopolitical Expansion

A critical area of concern for the future is the potential for China to leverage the situation in Ukraine to act on its claims over Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. China considers Taiwan its territory, mirroring Russia's stance on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Recent reports from February 24th indicate Chinese fighters have exceeded Taiwanese airspace, alongside a high concentration of military forces, similar to Russia's buildup near Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The Japanese prime minister has stated that Japan and the United States could not remain on the sidelines if China were to invade Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Given that Russia's invasion of Ukraine has not resulted in military consequences from other nations, China might perceive an opportunity to act against a country not part of NATO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This situation could become a major [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | area of friction]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

## Economic Consequences of the Conflict

The primary [[economic_consequences_of_the_new_world_order | economic consequences]] expected in the coming months include:

### Rising Energy Prices
The significant increase in oil and gas prices is considered the main factor and could lead to serious problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This exacerbates existing [[current_economic_conditions_and_inflation_impact | inflationary pressures]] that were already causing stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Historical data shows a high correlation between rising oil prices and [[ukraine_invasion_and_potential_global_recession | economic recessions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. When Brent crude oil (inflation-adjusted) has surpassed $100, it has historically coincided with recessions, such as in 2001, 2008, and nearly in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. Increased energy prices lead to less disposable income, reduced consumption, lower company earnings, and a suffering stock market and economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

### SWIFT System Exclusion
The exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international money transfers and trade, is a significant measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. This effectively blocks Russia economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. However, the German finance minister warned that excluding Russia from SWIFT would have serious [[consequences_of_ukraine_invasion_on_global_finance | economic consequences]] for Germany, Europe, and the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. Measures are currently selective, targeting specific banks and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Sanctions and Measures
The United Kingdom was among the first to establish specific measures:
*   **Ban from Capital Markets:** Russia and its companies are banned from UK capital markets, a major source of financing for Russian firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This severely limits new debt and share issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Sovereign Debt Limitation:** The sale of Russian sovereign debt in markets like London will be limited, a measure that could extend globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Oligarch Targeting:** Western countries are greatly limiting the movements and fortunes of the Russian oligarchy, who control key sectors (oil, gas, banking, transportation) and financially support the Putin regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. This puts economic pressure on the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The wealth of these oligarchs often originated from the "biggest robbery in history" following the fall of the Soviet Union, where state-owned company shares meant for workers were acquired cheaply due to their financial ignorance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.
*   **Foreign Bank Limits:** Russian citizens are limited to $66,000 in foreign banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **High-Tech Export Ban:** All exports of high-technology equipment to Russia are banned, affecting companies like ARM and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

### Impact on Global Markets
The [[impact_of_russian_financial_instability_on_global_markets | conflict]] and subsequent measures could cause volatility in the short and medium term, though historically, war conflicts have had a null to medium effect in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. Drops of 10-20% in the S&P 500 have been observed in the short term, with quick recoveries typically within one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:13">[00:20:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. The stock market has even survived World War II, often performing better on average after bad news is incorporated into prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:23">[00:52:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>.

## Affected and Benefited Sectors

### Negatively Affected Companies
Companies with significant sales or exposure in Russia are particularly vulnerable. If they are excluded from the SWIFT system or faced with other trade limitations, a large percentage of sales could evaporate, leading to substantial drops in profits due to operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Coca-Cola's Greek bottler** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>
*   **Carlsberg** (beer company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>
*   **Inditex** (Zara owner) – ~10-12% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:23">[00:13:23]</a>
*   **Renault** (car company) – significant sales in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>
*   **Philip Morris** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>
*   **Adidas** – had a large percentage of sales linked to the Russian market, leading to a drop from over 300 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:34">[00:36:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   **Luxury Brands** (e.g., Ferrari, Louis Vuitton) – dropped as troops concentrated, with the Chinese market representing 25-30% of Louis Vuitton's sales and the Russian market 5-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.
*   **Visa / Mastercard** – while affected by SWIFT limits, their global business model means the effect is not as large as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **GRIFOLS** – affected due to subcontracting engineers in Eastern European countries like Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:39">[00:53:39]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

### Positively Benefited Sectors/Companies
Some sectors are benefiting from the conflict and rising [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | energy prices]]:

*   **Energy Sector**
    *   **Cheniere Energy:** Exports liquefied gas, holding a near monopoly on cheap shale oil gas. This gas will likely be exported from the US as Germany and France seek alternatives to Russian supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The German minister confirmed supply is assured, but not at what price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
    *   **Marathon Oil:** An oil exploration and production company that has seen positive returns while other sectors declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>. It's a cyclical company, typically leveraged during periods of cheap valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>. Marathon Oil expects to generate $3 billion in free cash flow if Texas oil is at $80 a barrel (currently $95), equating to five times earnings or free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. Its breakeven cost for oil extraction is $35, making it resilient to price drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:57">[00:33:57]</a>.
*   **Raw Material Companies**
    *   **The Mosaic Company:** A fertilizer company. Russia is a large exporter of fertilizers, so if removed from international trade, Western companies like Mosaic could see increased sales and profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>.
*   **Defense Sector**
    *   **Lockheed Martin, Northrop Grumman, General Dynamics:** These major defense contractors are set to benefit significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Germany, for instance, plans to drastically increase defense spending, potentially doubling its current 1.3% of GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. Modern defense budgets focus on state-of-the-art equipment for military superiority, which these companies provide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
*   **Government Subcontractors**
    *   **CACI International, KBR, Leidos, Halliburton:** These companies provide external support for technological, logistical, and cybersecurity needs during conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.

## Navigating Market Volatility

### The Investor's Mindset
It is crucial not to be naive and think that [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | global events]] will not affect investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. However, it's equally important not to make drastic decisions based on panic, such as withdrawing all savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. Maintaining balance is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. While the human aspect of war is tragic, investors can focus on the economic implications within their control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:33">[00:19:33]</a>.

### Opportunities in Downturns
Drops of 10% or more in the S&P 500 historically present opportunities for excess returns over one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:00">[00:21:00]</a>. For example, a 21% return was seen a year after an 11% fall in 1997 due to the Asian crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:17">[00:21:17]</a>. People who build wealth in the stock market understand these cycles and maintain a calm head during volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:25">[00:22:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

A "mental trick" for successful investing is to expect the situation to worsen and not change quickly, which helps in managing expectations and being prepared for potential further declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. Investing successfully requires mastering expectations and avoiding being a "stock market tourist" seeking quick money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:01">[02:22:01]</a>.

### Market Sentiment as an Indicator
When the majority of investors turn bearish, it often signals the best time to invest because pessimism reigns and stocks are cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:28">[02:52:28]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:38">[02:52:38]</a>. This was evident in 2020, where despite widespread bearish sentiment, buying opportunities emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:55">[02:52:55]</a>.

### Long-Term Perspective
The real money in the stock market is made in the long term, through "multibaggers" or "compounders" that multiply in value many times over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>. Patience is critical, as market fears can last one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>. The culture of immediacy, where everything is expected to be fast and instant, can lead to frustration in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.

## Investment Considerations

### Valuing Companies
*   **Cyclical Companies:** These depend heavily on market ups and downs (e.g., oil, construction). They often carry debt and are best utilized when cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:18">[00:31:18]</a>. Long-term investment in such companies can be risky due to prolonged sideways movement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>.
*   **Quality Businesses:** Companies with strong brands, pricing power, and good management tend to prosper across various economic environments, especially inflationary ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. Examples like Adidas demonstrate resilience despite short-term challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:10">[00:36:10]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Valuation:** It is crucial to ensure that investment is not made at "bubble levels" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:50">[00:38:50]</a>. Valuing shares involves considering company growth, business quality, future growth potential, operating markets, and margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:54">[00:39:54]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks:** When a company buys back its own shares, it signals that management believes the shares are undervalued, sending a powerful message to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:42">[00:37:42]</a>. Historically, investing in companies that consistently buy back shares has yielded higher returns than the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:14">[00:32:14]</a>.
*   **Chinese Companies:** Companies like Alibaba have seen significant drops in valuation due to delisting threats and concerns about China's potential alignment with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:51">[00:43:51]</a>. Alibaba's valuation is at an all-time low (11-12 times earnings), making it potentially attractive despite geopolitical risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>.
*   **Franchise Businesses:** These businesses (e.g., Franchise Group) perform well in inflationary periods because their income increases with sales, while costs are absorbed by franchisees, leading to increased profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Fad" Investments:** It is dangerous to invest in what is fashionable at any valuation, as seen with companies like Robinhood, which went public at high valuations and then collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:40">[00:59:40]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current [[economic_indicators_and_their_implications | economic environment]], while challenging, presents opportunities for informed investors. The key is to understand how geopolitical tensions translate into economic impacts, identify sectors and companies that are resilient or poised to benefit, and maintain a long-term, disciplined investment approach that balances quality with valuation.

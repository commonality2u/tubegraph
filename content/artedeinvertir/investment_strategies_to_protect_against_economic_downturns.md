Global aid reached record levels after the 2020 crisis, which could have serious consequences for both the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Notable investors like Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio have warned of this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article outlines ways to protect investments and potentially benefit from this new economic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Current Economic Situation

Global aid has grown rapidly, reaching alarming levels in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. The Institute of International Finance reported that the total global debt—summing corporate, government, and individual debt—stands at $270 trillion, while the global Gross Domestic Product (GDP) is only $80 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This equates to over $35,000 per person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this, pushing debt levels to records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stated that when government debt exceeds 77% of its GDP, it significantly hampers future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Most developed countries, including Spain, Europe, and the USA, have surpassed this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This record debt coincides with historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### Negative Interest Rates and Market Dynamics

For the past five years, the economy has witnessed negative interest rates, a phenomenon that has occurred only once in the last 300 years of economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Central banks have consistently lowered rates to address crises, but having reached zero, this tool is no longer available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

In this "world upside down," people are paying to lend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, lending to the German government via 10-year bonds with a negative yield of 0.6% per year ensures a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Despite this, demand for these debt bonds (in dollars and euros) is extremely high, with trillions flowing into the market daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This is due to speculation: while holding a negative-yield bond to maturity guarantees a loss, daily trading allows for profit if the yield becomes even more negative or central bank actions cause the bond price to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This "stratospheric speculation" is prevalent in the debt market, which is significantly larger than the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. In the US, the debt market is estimated at $40 trillion, double the stock market's $20 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Consequently, developments in the debt market will heavily impact stocks and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Debt with negative interest rates globally reached a record $17 trillion in 2017, having skyrocketed since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Crises stemming from high debt levels are typically the most severe in the current economic system because credit is "the lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis, driven by sub-prime mortgage debt, had severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, unlike the milder 2000 tech bubble which did not involve significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Ray Dalio's Warning and Inflationary Triggers

Ray Dalio, who manages the world's largest investment fund, warned that the world will be "very different in the next five years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He indicated that once interest rates hit 0%, asset prices cannot receive an additional boost, and traditional economic stimulus tools from central banks will cease to be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Dalio posits that the stock market and other markets will have a greater effect on the economy than the economy on the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If the debt market begins to fall, credit flow will halt, leading to significant economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Debt crises are typically triggered by aggressive interest rate hikes, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Central banks have recently issued large amounts of new money to finance 2020 crisis problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This new money usually causes inflation, which is the primary variable central banks monitor when raising interest rates to balance the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Therefore, future inflation, likely due to money printing, could trigger a fall in the debt market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Monitoring inflation is critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Strategies for Individuals

### Managing Debt
*   **Long-term debts**: Ideally, these should be at a fixed rate to leverage current low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If inflation rises, home values may increase, but fixed mortgage debt costs will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.
*   **Short-term, high-interest debts**: Explore refinancing options, such as personal loans, to reduce high interest rates common on credit cards (25-30% annually) to more manageable rates (8-12%) in the current low-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Importance of Saving
Saving is crucial for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When credit stops flowing, liquidity becomes the most valuable asset, enabling investments at unprecedented prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## [[strategies_for protecting_investments_during_economic_crises | Investment Strategies During Economic Downturns]]

### Avoid Highly Indebted Companies
Avoid investing in companies with high debt, especially cyclical businesses like banks, construction companies, or airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Rising interest rates would increase their costs, potentially leading to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. While some believe banks benefit from rising rates, increased delinquency would offset this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Warren Buffett has reduced his investment in the banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

To check a company's financial situation and debt levels:
*   Consult the financial balance sheet section of its annual report on its website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   Use websites like marketskinner.com (finance section) for processed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.

### Avoid Investing Using Debt
Avoid using debt for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When the market cycle shifts and opportunities arise, credit will only be available to investors with solvent portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This is when strategic debt can be used to capitalize on market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

### Accumulate Liquidity
Warren Buffett has recently accumulated record levels of liquidity, reaching an impressive $140 billion in Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. He has accumulated almost $100 billion in new liquidity over five years, making Berkshire Hathaway likely the publicly traded company with the most cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. This strategy highlights the value of liquidity for future problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.

### Invest in Companies with Specific Qualities
Buy companies that possess:
*   **Good liquidity**: Essential for making acquisitions or investing in a business during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Attractive valuation**: Allows for potential capital appreciation.
*   **High growth potential**: Especially those that grow through acquisitions, as crises present more acquisition targets at better prices, with less competition due to credit tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Warren Buffett has repeatedly used this pattern during crises, including in 2000, 2002, and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### Investing Against Bonds or Debt
This strategy carries high risk and requires significant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. For the average investor, directly investing against bonds is complicated due to minimum operation size and market opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. However, inverse debt ETFs facilitate such operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **US Debt Bond**: LTE FE from Proshares (ticker: TVEFE) for the 20-year bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Its past performance has not been good, as maintenance costs limit benefits if the debt market doesn't fall within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **European Debt Market**: LT EFE from DWS (ticker: XSV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Similar to the US ETF, its performance during recent years has not been satisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Example Investment Opportunities (Stocks)

These examples meet the criteria mentioned above and offer potential realization even without a debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

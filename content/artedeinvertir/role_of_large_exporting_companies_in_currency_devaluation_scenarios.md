In periods of currency [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | devaluation]], large exporting companies can play a significant role in helping investors [[strategies_to_protect_savings_from_dollar_devaluation | protect their capital and savings]] and even generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. This is considered a potentially lucrative [[investment_strategies_to_hedge_against_dollar_depreciation | investment strategy]] to counteract the effects of a weakening domestic currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## How Exporting Companies Benefit

When a domestic currency, such as the US dollar, undergoes [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | devaluation]], companies that export their products abroad benefit because they theoretically receive foreign currency that is more valuable than the devalued dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. Meanwhile, their production costs, which are typically denominated in the domestic currency, remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This disparity leads to an automatic increase in their income or earnings per share, which often reflects in their [[strategies_for_investing_in_volatile_economic_environments | stock market]] performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

## Historical Precedent: Brexit

A practical example of this phenomenon occurred in 2016 during Brexit, when the United Kingdom voted to leave the European Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. The British pound plummeted by more than 10 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Initially, the stock market saw a decline, but a select group of large exporting companies in the United Kingdom experienced significant revaluations in the following weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

*   **Rolls Royce**: This UK company, which manufactures its products in the UK but exports them globally, appreciated by over 30 percent in just a few weeks after the pound's devaluation at the end of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline**: Similarly, the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline, another large UK exporter, saw its stock rise by more than 20 percent immediately after the pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

These examples demonstrate how the market quickly recognizes the advantage gained by exporters during currency [[strategies_to_protect_savings_from_dollar_devaluation | devaluation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities

Investing in large exporting companies can be a strategic move to [[strategies_to_protect_savings_from_dollar_devaluation | protect against currency devaluation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.

### Identifying Exporting Companies

To determine the percentage of a company's sales that are exported, investors can refer to the company's annual report for a breakdown of sales by region or country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Websites like MarketScreener.com also process and present this information in an understandable way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. For example, by searching for a company's ticker (e.g., XOM for ExxonMobil) and navigating to the "company" tab, one can find a "sales by region" section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### ExxonMobil

ExxonMobil (NYSE: XOM), the largest oil company in the world, is an example of a company that could benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It meets two key conditions for protection against currency [[strategies_to_protect_savings_from_dollar_devaluation | devaluation]]:
1.  **Raw Material Producer**: As a producer of raw materials like oil, its value tends to increase if the dollar's value decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
2.  **Exporter**: More than half of its products are exported outside the US, further benefiting it from a weaker dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. According to MarketScreener.com, only 35 percent of its production is sold in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.

Historically, with oil levels between $50 and $65, ExxonMobil has earned around $4 per share and paid a dividend of $3 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. If oil prices return to their historical average from current crisis-induced lows, the company's profits are expected to increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. Exxon has historically traded at a valuation of 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, suggesting a target value of $60 per share when oil normalizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Another valuation method, based on its historical dividend yield of 4%, suggests a target value of $75 per share, nearly double its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

### Facer (Pfizer)

Pfizer (NYSE: PFE), a leading biotechnology company, is another example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Warren Buffett has invested more than $135 million in its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. More than 50 percent of Pfizer's sales are outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. The company boasts high returns on equity, consistently above 20 percent, and has low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. Pfizer expects to earn around $3 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Historically, this sector trades at 18 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>, suggesting a target value of $54 per share, compared to its current trading price of $38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

### Other Major US Exporters

A list of the 10 largest exporting companies in the U.S. includes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>:
*   ExxonMobil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>
*   Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>
*   Johnson & Johnson <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>
*   Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>
*   Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>

These companies are considered high-quality and can perform well in various economic environments, even while trading at reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

Investing in these companies aligns with strategies to protect savings from [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | dollar devaluation]] and could benefit from the potential [[decline_of_the_us_dollar_as_world_reserve_currency | end of the dollar as a world reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:00">[00:37:00]</a>.

[[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Cathie Wood]], the new star of Wall Street, achieved a 170% return in 2020 and over 700% in the last five years with her main investment fund [00:00:05]. She founded her investment company, ARK Invest, in 2015 after leaving her previous job in investment banking [00:01:09]. ARK Invest has grown from managing a small sum to currently managing over $30 billion [00:01:15]. Her personal wealth is estimated to be greater than $500 million, accumulated in very few years [00:01:21].

## Investment Philosophy and Approach

[[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Cathie Wood]] defines herself as an investor in innovation and disruptive technologies [00:02:05]. Unlike traditional Wall Street investors who focus heavily on numerical financial and accounting aspects, she prioritizes companies that are revolutionizing or creating new sectors [00:02:09].

Her two basic premises for investing in a stock are [00:02:48]:
1.  The company must be revolutionary and transforming a mature sector (e.g., Spotify in music) or directly creating new sectors (e.g., Tesla, Teladoc) [00:02:52].
2.  The company must have high sales growth, even if it does not currently have economic benefits [00:03:13]. She believes many such companies will dominate their respective markets, reinvesting earnings for growth, similar to Amazon's early strategy [00:03:21]. For example, she would not invest in a traditional, high-quality company like NestlÃ© because it operates in a mature sector with limited growth capacity [00:04:04].

Her six favorite sectors to invest in are [00:04:30]:
*   Artificial intelligence [00:04:37]
*   Autonomous cars [00:04:39]
*   Robotics [00:04:40]
*   3D printing [00:04:41]
*   Genetics [00:04:42]
*   Financial technology (Fintech) [00:04:43]

## Market Outlook and Warnings

[[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] has recently warned investors about a "major bubble" and "enormous risk" in passive or indexed management, specifically mentioning main indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and MSCI World [00:04:48]. She is not the first to express this concern; [[Michael Burrys stock market predictions | Michael Burry]] also warned about a similar bubble that "could eclipse the financial crisis of 2008" [00:05:01].

She explains that an index like the S&P 500 is "full of average companies" and designed for an inflationary world [00:05:22]. However, [[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] believes the market is heading towards a deflationary scenario due to high technological innovation and significant cost reduction in many economic areas [00:05:34]. In this future scenario, when these indices perform poorly and the bubble bursts, the market will appreciate companies with a high innovative component and technological disruption, which are not typically included in these indices and would therefore be less harmed [00:05:47].

In a recent interview with CNBC, she stated:
> "I do not believe that we are in an equity bubble until we see a rotation of bonds towards equities, despite the attraction that these instruments have for the older population, younger investors, millennials, prefer to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies and housing, in fact, they are the sectors that we like the most for next year" [00:06:10].

She highlights that fixed income and bonds have seen the most money flow in recent years and where most experts agree there is a "tremendous bubble" [00:06:33].

## Key Stock Picks and Outlook

[[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] has a target return of at least 20% for the coming year on the [[key_stocks_in_cathie_woods_portfolio | stocks]] within her main investment portfolio [00:00:38].

Her main investments, with their respective weightings in her portfolio, include:

*   **Tesla (TSLA)**: 9% weighting, over $2 billion invested [00:06:57]. Listed at $850 per share at the time of the transcript [00:07:07]. Tesla is revolutionizing the mobility segment with electric and autonomous cars [00:07:11]. [[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] mentioned a target price for Tesla of $7,000 per share, which was before a company stock split [00:07:20].
*   **Roku (ROKU)**: Listed at $440 per share at the time of the transcript [00:07:44]. Roku is an innovative company in the smart TV segment experiencing high sales growth [00:07:54]. It's described as "the Google of smart TV" and helps advertisers and consumers [00:08:02]. Roku's systems and services hold the largest market share, ahead of companies like Microsoft or Amazon [00:08:22]. It's expected to grow more than 40% annually [00:08:30], despite not currently producing profits [00:08:35].
*   **CRISPR Therapeutics (CRSP)**: 5% weighting [00:09:06]. Listed at $200 per share at the time of the transcript [00:09:10]. This company operates in the genetics and DNA modification segment, one of her favorite sectors [00:09:14]. The company is in the development phase, with gene therapies that could cure hereditary diseases [00:09:21]. These are considered highly speculative stocks due to not yet generating income and having multiplied by more than ten times in less than two years [00:09:35].
*   **Square (SQ)**: 4.7% weighting [00:09:51]. Listed at $220 per share at the time of the transcript [00:09:55]. Square operates in financial technology, another favored sector [00:10:00]. The company offers online and physical payment systems for merchants at lower costs and with less bureaucracy than traditional banks [00:10:21]. It has multiplied by more than 20 times on the stock market in less than five years since going public [00:10:36]. Adyen, listed in Amsterdam, is noted as a similar European company [00:10:46].
*   **Teladoc Health (TDOC)**: 4% weighting [00:11:03]. Listed at $230 per share at the time of the transcript [00:11:07]. Teladoc has revolutionized the telemedicine segment with mobile applications, videoconferencing systems, and a staff of experts and doctors [00:11:14]. In less than four years, the company grew from billing $120 million to over $1 billion, equivalent to more than 80% annual growth [00:11:27]. The telemedicine segment alone in the US could be worth $250 billion in a few years [00:11:37], meaning Teladoc still represents a small fraction of the potential market [00:11:48]. Unlike some of her other investments, Teladoc has positive earnings and cash flow [00:12:00], though its valuation is high at over 100 times earnings [00:12:06].
*   **Invitae Holdings (NVTA)**: 4% weighting [00:12:37]. Listed at $55 per share at the time of the transcript [00:12:41]. Invitae is similar to CRISPR Therapeutics, making advances in genetics and DNA [00:12:47]. Unlike CRISPR, it already has revenue and is expected to grow more than 60% by next year [00:12:55]. The company has risen more than 500% since 2018 [00:13:05].
*   **Zillow Group (ZG)**: 3% weighting [00:13:10]. Listed at $140 per share at the time of the transcript [00:13:14]. Zillow is defined as a fully digital real estate agency, allowing users to buy, sell, rent, or finance housing through its platforms [00:13:20]. This drastically reduces costs and has allowed the company to grow at over 30% annually [00:13:33]. While it produces positive sales and profits, its valuation is very demanding at 100 times earnings, compared to the market average of 12 times earnings for this ratio [00:13:42].

[[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] has stated that it is possible to achieve annual returns of up to 50% when investing with a small amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This concept motivated many starting investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## The Advantage of Small Capital

In a 1999 interview with *Businessweek* magazine, [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] highlighted that not having a lot of money is a "very big structural advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He asserted:
> "I think I can make a 50 percent annual return if I managed less than a million dollars. I think I would be able to emphasize I guarantee it." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>

This contrasts sharply with his current returns, which have reduced over the years from 50% annually to around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. He has stated that 10% is a good result given the level of assets he currently manages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

### Why Small Capital Allows Higher Returns
[[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Buffett]] explains that with a small sum, his investment approach would be "completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Managing a small amount, such as $10,000, expands the universe of possibilities to thousands of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In contrast, investing $100 trillion leaves few alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Key Principles for Investing with Small Capital

### 1. Invest Time and Effort
High-return opportunities require active investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. They will not appear without diligent searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### 2. Focus on Small Companies (Small Caps)
To find anomalies and opportunities, investors must look for companies "off the map," particularly small, local businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
*   **Avoid Large-Cap Indexes**: The S&P 500 contains the best-analyzed companies, making it difficult to generate returns above 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.
*   **Explore Beyond the Top 500**: Of the over 30,000 companies listed in the U.S., the remaining 29,500 offer a higher probability of finding undervalued "local businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. These are often non-globalized or non-international companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### 3. Continuous Learning and Preparation
When asked what advice he would give a young [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] starting today, he replied he would do "exactly the same thing that I did 40 years ago, which is to learn as much as possible about all kinds of American stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Opportunity Meets Preparation**: Success in the stock market is a combination of opportunity and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Without preparation, opportunities cannot be identified or leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **"Start with the Letter A"**: When faced with thousands of listed companies, [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Buffett]]'s ironic response was to "start with the letter A" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This emphasizes the need to investigate all shares, build mental models, and learn about every industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

### 4. Focus on Low P/E Ratios
To generate extraordinary returns like 50% annually, it is essential to focus on investments that are "very, very cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Example**: A stock trading at $10 earning $1 per share has a P/E of 10, yielding an estimated return of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>. However, a stock earning $1 per share but trading at $2 has a P/E of 2, which could translate to an estimated 50% annual return (1/2 * 100%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## How to Discover Investment Opportunities

### Historical vs. Modern Tools
*   **Historically**: [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and secret stock purchase | Buffett]] used "Moody's manuals," thick books listing companies with historical data like price evolution, P/E ratios, sales, benefits, and business descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Today**: Free online resources like Yahoo Finance or Morningstar.com provide similar detailed financial information for listed shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.
*   **Screeners**: Modern tools called "screens" allow investors to filter stocks based on various parameters such as low P/E, growth levels, or profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Practical Steps for New Investors
1.  **Choose an Attractive Industry**: Select a sector like health, IT, technology, or transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  **Learn the Sector**: Read reports from the largest companies in that sector, as they provide detailed insights into its workings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
3.  **Search for Smaller Companies**: Once knowledgeable about the sector, look for smaller, potentially undervalued companies within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

### [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and secret stock purchase | Warren Buffett's Western Insurance]]
In his early career, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and secret stock purchase | Buffett]] found Western Insurance trading at $3 a share, while it was making $20 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He aimed to buy as much as possible, emphasizing that these opportunities are not widely publicized and must be sought out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Humanice (True Fund Example)
An investment fund managing a small capital of 9 million euros invested in Humanice, a micro-company with only 30 million euros in capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It was off analysts' radar and ignored by the market, yet it was a good business with little debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Humanice traded at 1.50 euros per share with projected earnings of 1 euro per share, resulting in a P/E ratio of less than two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The fund bought shares daily for four months, accumulating a position of about one million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Three years later, the shares traded at 6 euros, quadrupling the initial purchase price and generating a significant profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Korean Stocks (Deja Flor)]]
Around 2004, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Buffett]] was given a book on Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. After scanning it for several hours, he found interesting opportunities and invested $100 million across 20 Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. One example was Deja Flor, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Its earnings per share were consistently strong, and it had significant investments per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Buffett]] bought it at 38,000 won (about twice its profits), and the stock quickly appreciated to almost 240,000 won, multiplying his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

## Why This Strategy Persists
These types of opportunities have always existed in markets and will continue to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. As investors become successful and manage larger sums, they often outgrow the ability to invest in these illiquid, small-cap companies due to insufficient shares in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. Therefore, the field remains open for those with smaller capital. Success requires illusion, passion, curiosity, hard work, and a willingness to operate differently from most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

The stock market is often comprised of two large groups of stocks: [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | value stocks]] and [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | growth stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>. While "growth" is a factor in analyzing any stock, it holds significant weight in the [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation]] of certain companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

## Characteristics and Market Behavior

### [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Growth Stocks]]
[[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Growth stocks]] are typically companies that promise significant future cash flow, even if they don't generate much or any in the present <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>. They often belong to the technology sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.

*   **Sensitivity to Interest Rates and Inflation**: [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Growth stocks]] are highly sensitive to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. When bond yields rise, as seen when the 10-year US bond yield tripled from 0.5% to 1.6%, [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth stocks]] tend to decrease in [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | value]] because other investments offer more profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>. Rising interest rates and inflation expectations do not bode well for their [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Palantir is cited as an example of a high [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth stock]] that currently doesn't generate cash flow but is expected to in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. Popular [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth stocks]] like Tesla and those held by funds like Cathie Wood's investments are prone to correction during periods of high inflation or rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:51">[00:17:51]</a>.

### [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Value Stocks]]
[[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Value stocks]] are often described as more "boring" or "quiet" companies that generate significant cash flow in the current period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

*   **Performance in Certain Conditions**: When there is inflation and rising interest rates, [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | value stocks]] tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. These stocks are often overlooked by the market until conditions favor them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.
*   **Examples**: Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, defense stocks, are given as examples of [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | value stocks]] that are more ignored by the market but may become interesting with changes in market structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:50">[00:49:50]</a>. Consumer companies like Philip Morris are also considered [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | value stocks]] due to their stability and crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.

## Impact of Interest Rates and Inflation

The 10-year US bond yield is considered the benchmark for comparing almost any global investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. As Warren Buffett states, interest rates act like the force of gravity on stock markets, being the most crucial factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

*   **Rising Bond Yields**: When bond yields rise, [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth stocks]] tend to underperform because their future earnings are discounted at a higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Inflation Expectations**: A high money supply and people's desire to spend after economic reopenings can lead to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. This is supported by rising bond yields and commodity prices, which are at multi-year highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. If inflation materializes, central banks may be forced to raise interest rates, further impacting [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth stocks]] negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   **Market Rotation**: Current market trends suggest a period where [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | value stocks]] will continue to do well, while high [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth technology stocks]] may continue to fall if inflation materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>. However, if inflation does not translate into reality, bond yields could fall again, leading to a market rotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.

## Investment Strategy

Understanding the [[value_investing_vs_growth_investing | differences between value and growth stocks]] is crucial for [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | investment strategies]]. When interest rates increase, [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | value stocks]] tend to perform well, while [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth companies]] may perform poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Overall, the market usually compensates, leading to a positive effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>.

It is important to have a solid [[investment_strategies_for_longterm_growth | investment style]] that aligns with individual comfort levels, whether investing in [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | value]], commodity, or [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | growth companies]], ensuring the investment makes fundamental sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>. Overreacting to short-term market movements based on capital flow or investor sentiment should be avoided, as the long-term fundamentals of a company generally prevail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:43">[01:00:43]</a>.

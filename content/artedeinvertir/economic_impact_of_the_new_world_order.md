The renowned economist and investor [[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] posits that a [[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | new world economic order]] is emerging, which will precipitate an unprecedented economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He identifies three critical challenges that humanity is currently unprepared for <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>, describing them as the most significant of our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

According to Dalio, an economic war is brewing that will lead to the decline of the United States and its allies, favoring [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He predicts a drastic shift in the economic outlook within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>, which will have significant consequences for the value of money, investments, and currencies like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Influence

[[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] possesses substantial global economic influence and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He is a regular participant at the Davos forum meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> and is the founder of Bridgewater Associates, reportedly the world's largest hedge fund, managing over 100 trillion dollars in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His opinions are highly respected in financial markets, especially for his successful navigation through major economic crises like those in 2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Dalio has recently summarized his insights into this new scenario in his book, "The New World Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## The Three Forces of Change

In a CNBC interview, Dalio detailed the three "greatest forces" he has witnessed in his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. Historically, the simultaneous occurrence of these issues has led to economic recessions and significant shifts that have ultimately brought down empires and major global currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### 1. Class Struggle and Social Inequality

The first problem identified is a growing class struggle between capitalism and communism, and between the wealthy and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Dalio highlights the expanding social gap, where 1% of the U.S. population increasingly owns more wealth, while the poorest 50% own less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Recent inflation crises have exacerbated this divide, as those without assets like stocks or real estate are less protected against inflation's effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### 2. Excessive Debt

The second critical issue is the enormous amount of [[global_debt_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | debt]] accumulated by both the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Dalio notes a decreasing demand for U.S. debt, viewing American bonds as a very risky investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. He suggests two potential outcomes: either interest rates on existing debt will rise, or the state will be forced to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. He links this to the first problem, explaining that printing more money to solve recessions will only lead to higher inflation, further widening the gap between social classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### 3. Rise of China and US Decline

The third warning from [[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] concerns the [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | rise of China]] and the impending decline of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. This shift would significantly impact the value of the dollar and its status as a global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For the past 70 years, the U.S. has dominated the international political landscape by controlling institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, but this era is ending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Dalio illustrates this with a graph showing the U.S. entering a "decline phase," characterized by high [[global_debt_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | debt]] levels, social struggles, and currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Conversely, [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] is in an "ascending phase" of wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Recommendations for Investors

Given this complex environment, Dalio offers advice to small investors on how to navigate the challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>:

*   **Invest to counter inflation:** Investors must prevent their money from losing value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The only way to do this is to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. As money has been printed and new [[global_debt_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | debt]] created, asset values like stocks and gold have risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He strongly advises against holding what seems "safe" like liquidity or fixed income, as their value will likely decline in inflationary scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.
*   **Focus on real assets:** Real assets with constant demand, such as stocks, real estate investments, or gold, are expected to perform much better relatively in this new scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Diversify globally:** In a world of high uncertainty and risks, it is crucial to learn to diversify investments without reducing performance expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Good diversification can reduce risk by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Dalio advocates investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, aligning with his "four seasons" portfolio management theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Current Investment Strategy

Dalio's portfolio reflects his current economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>:

*   **Shift from bonds to stocks:** While he typically holds a significant portion of his portfolio in debt or long-term bonds, his main positions are now in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   **Preferred sectors:**
    *   **Technology:** His current preferred sector is technology, with investments in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
    *   **Stable/Defensive Consumer Companies:** He also favors stable or defensive consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.
*   **Sales/Avoided Sectors:** He is reportedly selling positions in the banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, due to their sensitivity to the economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Small-Cap Stocks:** Dalio has also invested in the Russell 2000 small-caps ETF (IWM), which aggregates the 2000 main small-cap companies in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. These stocks tend to perform better when interest rates drop and liquidity increases in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

The U.S. dollar, currently the world's most important currency, has begun a decline. An alliance led by China and the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa) aims to end the dollar's dominance as a world reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This shift is predicted to affect the value of currencies, savings, investments, inflation levels, and the cost of living globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## The Dollar's Current Dominance and Privileges

The dollar's status as the most important currency grants the United States significant privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Even for those who do not hold dollars, this impending change will have [[the_potential_impact_of_global_economic_changes_on_currency_and_assets | widespread effects]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

### Ability to Print Money Without Significant Inflation
A key advantage of owning the world's reserve currency is that the United States can print large amounts of new dollars without generating substantial inflation in its economy, due to constant international demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The value of currencies is determined by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Historically, during economic problems over the last 50 years, the U.S. has activated its dollar printer to solve crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For instance, to address the 2020 crisis, 23% of all dollars in circulation at that time were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Despite a slight recent inflation, this is minimal compared to other countries that have resorted to printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

In contrast, Argentina's Central Bank balance sheet increased by 80% between 2017 and 2018 to solve its crisis, leading to an enormous 60% annual inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The U.S. Federal Reserve's balance sheet, measuring money printing, grew over 120% from 4 trillion to 9 trillion dollars in less than a year and a half during the 2020 crisis, yet inflation currently stands at only 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This difference highlights why the U.S. has prospered after crises while countries like Brazil, Argentina, or China have been harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### Lower Interest Rates for Financing
The dollar's status allows the United States and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This provides a competitive advantage for their economies to prosper, as investors are reluctant to lend money to countries with weak currencies prone to depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This creates a virtuous circle where a stronger currency attracts more lending at cheaper rates, further reinforcing its strength <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## The Rise of BRICS as a Counter-Power

A new paradigm shift has begun quietly, with the roadmap to end dollar dominance established at the BRICS Summit in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Formation and Global Influence
Until recently, the G7, comprising the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, main European countries, and Japan, was the sole global power focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. A new power group, BRICS (Brazil, Russia, India, China, South Africa), has formed to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The BRICS group holds significant potential for success against the G7, as it accounts for 43% of the world's population, compared to the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. More countries are joining BRICS to escape dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

### Open Challenge to Dollar Dominance
The BRICS alliance openly states its plans to end subjection to the dollar's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. For instance, newly elected Brazilian President Lula da Silva stated that one of his objectives was to end the dollar's dominance, with Brazil often seen as a spokesperson for [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China's true intentions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This movement is expected to cause a significant "economic earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Currently, 62% of the world's money is represented in dollars, while G7 currencies like the Euro, Pound, and Yen are considered "franchises of the American dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### Trading in Local Currencies
The BRICS alliance proposes to trade within its territory using its own currencies, excluding the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. This strategy would boost the value and international demand for their currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Following the design of this new roadmap by BRICS countries, the dollar's value on the stock market has begun to decline sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. The Dollar Index, measuring the dollar's value against major currencies, plummeted over 13% in less than 9 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Since the start of the conflict, the Chinese yuan (remambi) has gained market share internationally, rising from 2% to 4%, dangerously nearing the Euro's market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Key Factors for Currency Hegemony and [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China's Strategy]]

While China possesses vast production capacity and advanced technology, and allied BRICS countries hold essential raw materials, the United States remains a world leader in many aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.

### The Role of Military Supremacy
A crucial factor determining global currency hegemony is [[role_of_military_power_in_global_currency_dominance | military supremacy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Historically, world reserve currencies have been associated with military power that guarantees economic security and currency prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>:
*   **Spain (1500-1700):** Its currency was the world reserve due to its military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **British Pound (1800-1900):** Gained dominance through Britain's military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **U.S. Dollar (Last 100 years):** Remains undisputed king due to its army <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

China is acutely aware of this factor and is investing heavily in its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. China's military spending is nearing that of the United States and is estimated to surpass it in less than five years, with an annual expenditure exceeding $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This military arms race is benefiting defense sector stocks listed on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

The U.S. maintains its military power through key private companies listed on the stock market, such as:
*   **Lockheed Martin:** Manufacturer of the F-22 Raptor (exclusive to the U.S.) and F-35 (sold to U.S. and G7 allies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics:** Manufactures advanced nuclear submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.
*   **Northrop Grumman:** Producer of the B-2 spy bomber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
*   **Raytheon:** Specializes in long-range Tomahawk missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

These companies have shown formidable stock market results due to high demand from G7 governments, manufacturing key elements for maintaining military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. They are also insulated from traditional economic crises, as defense spending budgets tend to be linear and constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

### BRICS Free Trade Area
China's second major strategy to force this change is to create a large, tax-free free trade area among all BRICS countries and those that join the alliance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. More than 60% of the world's population is projected to join this macro-area of international free trade promoted by China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. In contrast, the U.S. and G7 allies move slower and more bureaucratically; their past attempt to launch a similar free trade area (TPP) failed due to internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Potential [[the_potential_impact_of_global_economic_changes_on_currency_and_assets | Economic Repercussions]] and [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | Investment Strategies]]

Leading investors have warned about the dollar's future decline and have begun selling their dollar holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### Ray Dalio's Perspective and Gold Investment
Ray Dalio, a prominent investment fund manager, believes that China is in a phase of ascent while the United States is in decline, which will drag the dollar to its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. He advises investors to protect themselves from this dollar fall by [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investing in gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. According to Dalio, gold is the purest form of money because it cannot be printed out of thin air and will always protect against the long-term depreciation of other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

Gold has appreciated by an average of 9% annually over the last 20 years, even when measured against major currencies, and has shown low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

Ways to invest in gold:
1.  **Physical Gold:** Disadvantages include security and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Gold Mining Companies:** Can suffer operational problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
3.  **Gold ETFs:** Ray Dalio's preferred method. Examples include GLD (ticker: GLD) for U.S. investors and EGRN for European investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller's Perspective and TIPS
Stanley Druckenmiller, known for his expertise on currency values, also expresses a lack of confidence in the Federal Reserve and Biden's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. He views selling dollars and buying gold as a good bet, especially with Lula da Silva's stated objective to end dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Druckenmiller believes that a fall in the dollar's value would cause increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. In such a scenario, he finds U.S. inflation-protected bonds called TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) very interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. TIPS guarantee a return above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.

Ways to invest in TIPS:
1.  **Direct Purchase of the Bond:** Can be complex for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
2.  **ETFs Investing in TIPS:** Easier way to gain exposure. Examples include Charles Schwab ETF on TIPS (ticker: SCHP) in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. For European investors, [[blackrocks_influence_on_the_global_economy | BlackRock]] offers a similar currency-hedged ETF (ticker: ITPE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Broader [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | Investment Strategies]] for Dollar Decline
If the dollar's value drops, leading to inflation, holding liquidity or traditional bonds not protected against inflation is considered the worst idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. Historically, real estate and stock market investments have performed satisfactorily during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

Other smart ways to protect and benefit through the stock market include:
1.  **U.S. Exporting Companies:** Look for American companies listed in dollars with a significant export component to non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. When these companies translate foreign currency profits into dollars, their earnings would increase, leading to stock appreciation. Brexit serves as an example, where UK exporting companies like Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline rose sharply while the general stock market and currency collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
2.  **Companies with Exposure to the Chinese Economy:** Consider companies with high exports to China to benefit from its expected economic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Examples include casinos like Wynn and Las Vegas Sands, and technology/semiconductor companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.
3.  **Luxury Sector Companies:** These companies (e.g., Louis Vuitton, Hermes, Ferrari) are often denominated in euros or dollars, and Chinese consumers have become major buyers of luxury goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. An economic boom in China would increase their sales, translating into higher profits in euros or dollars, providing a hedge against a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. These companies tend to prosper in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

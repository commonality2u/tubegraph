The potential for the dollar to decline in value, exacerbated by central bank and government decisions, creates new [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment opportunities]] [00:00:03]. Experts like Ray Dalio, who manages Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest investment fund, predict the dollar will lose value and are selling the currency [00:00:11]. What happens to the dollar will affect economies and [[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | stock markets]] globally [00:00:23]. This article explores how to protect capital and savings from dollar devaluation, specifically focusing on [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_energy_sectors | investment opportunities in gold]] and certain types of bonds.

## Understanding the Dollar's Decline
The dollar is currently considered the global foreign exchange reserve, meaning its fluctuations impact other currencies and economies [00:00:57]. Data from the International Monetary Fund shows that 62% of the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars, potentially rising to over 70% when considering dollarized economies [00:01:11]. A significant fact highlighting its devaluation is that 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created in 2020 alone, for a currency with 200 years of history [00:01:28]. Since the recent crisis began, the dollar has devalued over 10% against the Euro in just nine months [00:01:42].

Most major currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by gold [00:01:54]. Before the 1970s, each new dollar had to be backed by a certain amount of gold, which controlled inflation and aggressive currency devaluation [00:02:02]. This changed with the Bretton Woods agreement in the early 1970s, giving the Federal Reserve the ability to print as many dollars as it wants [00:02:21]. Drastically increasing the supply of new dollars in circulation can lead to a fall in the currency's value, increased inflation, and economic collapse [00:02:38].

The M2 money supply, or the amount of dollars in circulation, has shown an uncontrolled increase since the beginning of the 2020 crisis [03:01:00]. The Federal Reserve, under Chairman Jerome Powell, has stated comfort with a higher level of inflation, indicating an intention to increase the money supply and devalue the dollar [03:31:00]. Historically, such monetary experiments have not worked, as seen with the Roman Empire, Germany in the early 20th century, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe [03:46:00]. In Zimbabwe, a 100 trillion dollar banknote was issued, and money became so worthless it was transported in wheelbarrows [04:06:00].

If you have money in fixed terms or uninvested, it will likely lose value due to inflation [06:46:00]. Similarly, [[the_risk_and_opportunity_in_investing_in_bonds_and_debt_markets | investments]] in fixed income or bonds are seriously affected by increased inflation or currency devaluation [06:54:00].

### Investing in Gold
One effective way to protect against currency devaluation is to invest in gold [08:10:00]. Gold acts like any other currency, but unlike fiat currencies, it cannot be created out of thin air [08:17:00]. The price of gold is denominated in dollars, so if there are more dollars in circulation and their price goes down, the price of gold will tend to rise [08:23:00].

Historically, investing in gold was complex due to buying, storing, and security costs [08:39:00]. However, in the [[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | stock market]], one can invest in gold through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that hold physical gold, offering a more effective and secure way to invest [08:47:00].

*   **Europe Example**: The iShares Physical Gold ETF (EGLN) is listed on the London Stock Exchange [09:03:00]. It trades at approximately 28 euros per share and has appreciated over 40% in the last two years [09:08:00].
*   **US Example**: The iShares Gold Trust (GLD) is listed in the US [09:17:00]. It trades at approximately 169 dollars per share and has also shown good performance in the last two years [09:20:00].

Ray Dalio has stated he is investing in gold [05:17:00]. Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller is also investing in gold [06:19:00].

### Investing in Inflation-Protected Bonds
Another strategy, as suggested by Ray Dalio, is to invest in "TIPs" (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) [09:28:00]. These bonds are specifically protected against inflation [09:34:00]. If the dollar falls and inflation increases, these bonds will appreciate in value based on that inflation [09:37:00].

A simple way to invest in these bonds is also through ETFs [09:44:00].

*   **US Example**: The iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) is listed in the US under the ticker TEIP [09:47:00]. It trades at approximately 126 dollars per share [09:51:00]. This ETF has appreciated over 10% so far this year due to the ongoing dollar devaluation and high inflation expectations [09:56:00].

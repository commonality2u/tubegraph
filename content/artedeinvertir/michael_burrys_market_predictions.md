[[michael_burrys_economic_predictions | Michael Burry]], recognized as one of the most expert investors, has a history of making accurate market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. He warned about the real estate market crisis in 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>, the "Coby issue" (COVID-19) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, and at the start of 2021, he predicted significant inflation, economic problems, and recession, which have since materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. His statements have often been dismissed initially but have consistently proven true <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a>.

## Current Market Outlook

[[michael_burrys_recent_stock_sale_and_market_outlook | Michael Burry]] has recently become active on Twitter again, sharing his current market vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He has been assertive in his forecasts, particularly in light of recent market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

He observes an indicator related to the percentage of shares trading above their 200-day daily average, which is a technical analysis perspective. He noted that currently, only 13% of shares are above this average, a relatively low number <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. For context, in a bull market, this figure is typically 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. At the lows of 2009, only 1% of stocks were in this positive psychological situation, and in 2020 during the lockdown, it was 2.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This suggests that further declines could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Recession and Corporate Profits

[[michael_burrys_economic_predictions | Michael Burry]]'s earlier prediction of a second phase driven by a "recession of profits" appears to be unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. An internal document from the Federal Reserve estimates that corporate profits could fall by 30% due to rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The Federal Reserve's stance, articulated at the end of August, indicates they will continue raising rates even if it leads to a recession, prioritizing the end of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

### Comparison to 2000 Dot-Com Bubble

[[michael_burrys_prediction_of_a_stock_market_crisis | Michael Burry]] has stated that the current environment feels similar to the middle or end of the year 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>. He points out that stocks generating significant free cash flow or profits are currently very cheap and "totally ignored" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. In contrast, "old momentum stocks" or "High flyers" (companies that performed well last year, e.g., Shopify, Roku, Palantir, Peloton, Beyond Meat, Nio) which were listed at very high multiples, are experiencing significant declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This mirrors the year 2000, where the Fed's rate hikes burst the bubble in such stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:42">[00:23:42]</a>.

He notes that the chronology is similar to 2000: an initial broad market fall, followed by a summer rebound, and then further declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>. In 2000, "safe" companies like Coca-Cola and McDonald's were the last to fall, which is also happening now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

## Investment Strategy

[[michael_burrys_investment_strategy_and_theories | Michael Burry]] believes that this period marks a resurgence for the "value investing style" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>. This strategy involves selecting stocks that are cheap in relation to their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>. He noted that in 2001, after a year of market decline, many cheap shares began to respond positively, leading to positive returns for funds selecting such shares, even as the broader market had negative yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:10">[00:51:10]</a>.

### Warning on Passive Investing

[[michael_burrys_investment_strategy and theories | Michael Burry]] has been warning for some time about a bubble in passive investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. He explains that this bubble, inflated over the last decade, will not deflate in just six or nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. He highlights that indices like the S&P 500 or Nasdaq are skewed, with performance often driven by only a few dominant stocks (e.g., Apple, Microsoft, Google) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. This concentration means these indices may not fulfill their original diversification function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:42">[00:20:42]</a>. He notes a significant imbalance since 2008, with large capital flows into passive investing compared to active investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.

### Opportunities in Small/Medium Companies

[[michael_burrys_investment_strategy and theories | Michael Burry]] sees many opportunities in medium and small companies (small caps), which he believes are "very cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:06">[00:21:06]</a>. He points out that companies growing more than large firms, with similar or better business models, trade at significantly lower valuations (e.g., 8-10 times earnings) compared to larger index-listed companies (double the valuation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:15]</a>. He suggests that if capital starts flowing into these undervalued small and medium caps, it could lead to a "very good decade for that style of investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>.

## Market Bottom Indicators

[[michael_burrys_prediction_on_the_end_of_the_current_crisis | Michael Burry]] suggests that the current bear market is nearing its end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Historically, bear markets last an average of 365 days (one year), and the current one has been ongoing for nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. This implies the market *should* reach a low point by the end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>.

Market bottoms are typically obvious, marked by notable events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:14">[00:53:14]</a>. For example:
*   In 2020, the market bottomed when the Federal Reserve announced it would inject necessary liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:26">[00:53:26]</a>.
*   In 2018, the Fed's acknowledgement of having gone too far with rate hikes led to a market low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>.
*   In 2016, a secret meeting of central banks (ECB, Fed, Bank of Japan) to support the system also marked a turning point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.

Therefore, the speaker suggests that a clear shift in the Federal Reserve's stance, indicating a potential danger from their current actions, could signal a market bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>.

The global financial system faces a significant challenge as a new economic scenario approaches, which is expected to affect everyone equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This impending economic disaster has raised concerns about the potential for a total collapse of the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Warnings from Janet Yellen

Janet Yellen, the current director of the American Treasury and former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, has expressed serious concerns about this developing [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. Yellen oversees an entity that manages over four trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>, and her deep knowledge of the economy and [[factors_influencing_global_financial_markets | financial markets]] makes her opinion vitally important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

She has stated that if a solution is not found in the coming weeks, it could cause irreversible damage to the American economy and to global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Yellen has warned that the [[current_global_debt_crisis and its impact on the economy | debt ceiling problem]] could mean the total collapse of the financial system, leading to terrible consequences for both stocks and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. She considers the periodic creation of self-manufactured crises by putting an arbitrary debt ceiling as "tremendously irresponsible," especially during recovery from a deep crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

## The US Debt Ceiling Crisis

The United States government consistently spends more money than it earns, resulting in a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. To finance this spending, new debt is issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. For many years, a limit has been established on how much the United States can go into debt, and this limit is now about to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

As a result, Janet Yellen has begun taking "desperate measures" to address the problem, including significantly cutting investments in pension and health plans, and suspending government investments for employee retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. These measures amount to a spending cut of over 200 billion American dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. The Treasury warns that there is "considerable uncertainty in the use of extraordinary measures" and that these only provide "limited time to maneuver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.

### Market Indicators of Risk

[[stock_market_volatility_and_the_impact_of_global_events | Financial markets]] are already pricing in a potential bankruptcy of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDs), which are insurance policies against government debt default, have seen their price to insure American government debt multiply by more than nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. This indicates that the risk of the United States defaulting on its debt is considered "enormous for the financial markets and especially for the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Potential Consequences of a US Default

If the United States were to default on its debt, it would be akin to "gravity ceasing to exist," leading to "total chaos and a financial collapse" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### Global Financial System Impact
The entire [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | global financial system]] is interconnected with American debt, which represents the largest asset class internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:00">[04:20:00]</a>. The total American debt has grown exponentially to 30 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:00">[04:33:00]</a>. A collapse of this asset class would have a "chain effect" because millions of entities, including banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans, hold enormous amounts of these treasury bills and bonds, which were previously considered the safest investment worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This situation is compared to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but "multiplied by 30 times" due to the significantly higher balance of total US debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>.

### Asset Class Impacts
A default would harm a multitude of investments, but also cause a select group to rise on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:00">[05:19:00]</a>.
*   **Dollar bonds and fixed income** would collapse, as investors would lose confidence, leading to enormous capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Stocks and equity investments** would fall sharply, with the exception of a select group <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.
*   The price of **gold** would likely rise sharply, providing a safe haven, as its price is measured against the American dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

### Economic Impacts
A White House report details that a default would mean:
*   Loss of more than 2 million jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:22:00">[06:22:00]</a>.
*   An additional cost of over 750 billion dollars annually in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>.
*   The dollar and the stock market would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>. The White House estimates potential drops of up to 45% in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions and Their Market Implications

The most viable solution would be an agreement between Republicans and Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. However, current proposed solutions are desperate, including the possibility of minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. This concept, though seemingly comical, is real due to a legal loophole allowing the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. Such coins could be deposited with the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to continue paying expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>.

While this solution could work in the short term, it would not send a message of stability to [[factors_influencing_global_financial_markets | financial markets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>. In this scenario, the value of the dollar, bonds, and stocks would continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

## Timeline and Outlook

Janet Yellen has warned that the "extraordinary measures" adopted by the Treasury are likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. This suggests that a collapse of American debt could be "just around the corner" and a matter of weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

Previous debt limit scenarios in 2011 and 2013, even when temporary solutions were reached, still led to high [[stock_market_volatility_and_the_impact_of_global_events | market volatility]] in the following weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

## Investor Protection Strategies

In response to this [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risk]], many investors are betting against American debt and the stock market, anticipating historic falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   **Gold** is expected to benefit as a safe haven asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDs)** can be purchased by large investors to protect against default risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   Not all stocks would decline; those related to the **gold sector**, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs** which increase in value when the market goes down, are being considered for tactical short-term protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. An example is the ProShares Short S&P500 (SH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. However, these instruments have historically performed poorly in the long term as the stock market tends to revalue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

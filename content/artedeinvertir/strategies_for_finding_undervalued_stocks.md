Warren Buffett has stated that it is possible to generate high annual returns, up to 50%, with a small amount of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. In a 1999 interview with *Businessweek* magazine, Buffett emphasized this point, claiming he could achieve a 50% annual return if he managed less than a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. He views having little money to invest as a "very big structural advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Buffett's own returns have naturally decreased over time as his capital grew, from 50% down to 10% annually, stating that 10% is a good result for him given his current asset level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. With a small sum, his "universe expands," offering thousands of possibilities, unlike managing hundreds of billions of dollars which has fewer alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. To find these opportunities, one must "move a lot of rocks" and look for "anomalies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Where to Look

Undervalued opportunities are generally found in companies "off the map," including small, local companies that are performing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### Focus on Small Caps
It is crucial to focus on [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | small companies]], often referred to as "small caps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Large Companies (e.g., S&P 500):** Out of over 30,000 companies listed in the US, only about 500 are in the Standard and Poor's index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. These are the most analyzed and well-known companies, making it difficult to generate annual returns above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   **Small Companies:** The remaining 29,500+ companies offer a higher probability of finding undervalued "local businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. "Local" implies they are not globalized or international, and thus are not typically part of major indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Essential Strategies

### 1. Invest Time and Effort
Finding these opportunities requires significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. They will not simply appear on their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. By researching numerous companies (e.g., five), one might identify one or more exceptional investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### 2. Learn and Prepare
Success in the [[stock_analysis_and_investment_strategies | stock market]] is a combination of opportunity and preparation; luck does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Extensive Knowledge:** Learn as much as possible about all kinds of American stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, covering different businesses and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This knowledge is crucial for identifying opportunities when they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   **Historical Research:** In the past, investors like Warren Buffett would manually scan through "Moody's manuals" â€” thick books containing detailed information on listed companies, including historical prices, P/E ratios, sales, benefits, and business descriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This process of investigating all shares helps build mental models and learn about various industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.
*   **Modern Tools:** Today, free online platforms such as Yahoo Finance or Morningstar.com provide similar information, allowing access to historical data like sales, profits, and ownership details <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Stock Screens:** Modern tools like "screens" allow investors to filter stocks by various parameters such as low P/E ratios, growth levels, or profit margins, making the scanning process more efficient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### 3. Industry Specialization (Initial Step)
To avoid feeling overwhelmed, it is recommended to start by choosing an attractive industry (e.g., health, IT, technology, transportation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Learn as much as possible about that specific sector, starting with reports from larger companies for detailed insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Once a strong understanding is developed, then look for smaller companies within that sector for potential undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### 4. Focus on Low P/E Ratios
To generate extraordinary returns, it is essential to focus on investments that are very cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   A stock trading at $10 with earnings of $1 per share (P/E of 10) might yield around 10% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   However, finding a stock earning $1 per share but trading at $2 (P/E of 2) could potentially yield a 50% annual return (1/2 * 100%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This is a theoretical value and can vary, but it highlights the importance of a low P/E for high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

### 5. Buy as Much as Possible
When a promising [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | investment opportunity]] is identified, particularly in a micro company with little debt and ignored by the market, the strategy is to "buy as much as possible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. This means accumulating a significant position, constrained only by the liquidity of the stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

### Western Insurance
Warren Buffett identified Western Insurance, which was trading at $3 per share but making $20 per share, indicating a significant undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He sought to buy as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Humanes
An example from a fund managing 9 million euros (a "small sum") involved Humanes, a micro-company with a capitalization of merely 30 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. It was barely followed by analysts and off the radar of many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The company was profitable, had low debt, and was simply ignored by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Humanes was trading at 1.50 euros per share, with projected earnings of 1 euro per share for the following year, resulting in a P/E ratio of less than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The fund bought shares daily for four months, accumulating a position of about one million euros at 1.50 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. Three years later, these shares traded at 6 euros per share, multiplying the purchase price by four times and generating a significant profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Korean Stocks (2004)
Around 2004, Warren Buffett spent five or six hours scanning a book on Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He found several interesting opportunities and decided to invest 100 million dollars, divided among 20 of these stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.
*   **Daehan Flour:** One example was Daehan Flour, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Its earnings per share in recent years ranged from 2,800 won to 23,800 won, and it had 100,000 won per share in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The stock was trading at 38,000 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Buffett noted that one could "make money buying stocks like this at twice the profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. He achieved a very good return, as the stock quickly appreciated from 38,000 Korean won to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Conclusion
These situations have always existed in the markets and will continue to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Success requires "illusion, passion, curiosity," hard work, and doing things differently from other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. The challenge is not in the scarcity of opportunities but in the diligence and preparation of the investor.

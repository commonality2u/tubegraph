The current global economic landscape is undergoing a significant transformation, influenced by a new economic reform known as "The Great Economic Reset" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This reform is expected to affect everyone equally, regardless of whether they invest in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. It has garnered support from powerful figures worldwide, including heads of government and prominent businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This article explores how to protect capital and savings in this new scenario, or even benefit from it through various [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Understanding The Great Economic Reset

The Great Economic Reset movement is spearheaded by the World Economic Forum (WEF), an organization founded by Klaus Schwab <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The WEF, supposedly a non-profit NGO, includes influential members such as China's President Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and George Soros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

The most public aspect of the WEF is the annual Davos World Economic Forum, held in January in the Swiss Alps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Access to this event can cost between $13,000 and $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The Davos Forum 2021 was held to launch this new economic reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

This economic "recipe" is presented as a response to the current global crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, proposing a complete transformation of society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Klaus Schwab has even published a book detailing his future plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While presented as beneficial, some proposed reforms may not be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The reforms primarily focus on three areas: social, economic, and environmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, within a capitalist system, new economic measures are central to these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

## Key Reforms and Their Investment Implications

### 1. Increased Taxes

One of the primary proposals is an increase in taxes for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is mainly due to governments' increased indebtedness following the recent crisis, necessitating more tax collection to repay debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. Additionally, increased taxes will boost sectors recommended by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

This mechanism is already underway in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve president and now Secretary of the Treasury, holds significant economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. President Joe Biden's economic plan aligns with many of the Great Economic Reset's reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Yellen has stated that the recovery plan will prioritize raising taxes on the wealthy, who benefited from 2017 tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. She even proposed taxing unrealized profits in the stock market, which could discourage [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | investment in the stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

The 2017 tax cuts in the US led to accelerated profits for the S&P 500 between 2016 and 2018, contributing to a bullish stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Reversing these cuts could have an opposite, negative effect, with some analysts predicting a 15-20% drop in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

However, some [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investments in equities]] may not be affected by these theoretical tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### 2. Environmental Focus and Carbon Emissions

The Great Economic Reset promotes "zero emissions balance," leading to significant aid for the renewable and clean energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. New taxes will discourage polluting energies and generate funds for cleaner alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. The Davos 2021 forum agenda is heavily focused on renewable energies and carbon emissions, with prominent guests like Bill Gates and Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The Biden administration has committed over $2 trillion in aid to the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This explains the strong performance of this sector in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

Conversely, investment in highly polluting energies like oil and coal is discouraged, which is reflected in their poor stock market performance in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

New [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investment opportunities]] have emerged in related areas:
*   **Electric Cars:** e.g., Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>
*   **Wind Generation:** e.g., Gamesa, Siemens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>
*   **Solar Energy:** e.g., Jinko Solar, Canadian Solar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>

For broader exposure, ETFs related to clean energy are available. The Nasdaq Clean Energy ETF (ticker: CELS), listed in the US, has risen over 300% in under two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. European alternatives, like the iShares Global Clean Energy, also show excellent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.

### 3. The Fourth Industrial Revolution (New Technologies)

This reform aims to promote new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The Davos forum dedicates an entire day to this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. The European Union's official website shows plans for over 140 billion euros in aid for innovation and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This forces governments and companies to invest in new technological projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This explains why the Nasdaq and technology stocks have been top performers in recent years, significantly benefiting from this "fourth industrial revolution" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Large American technology companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are among the most advantaged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. Their taxes are often declared abroad, potentially mitigating the impact of US tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

#### Investment Opportunity: Qualcomm (QCOM)

Qualcomm (ticker: QCOM) is a leading American technology company specializing in microchips and processors, especially for smartphones (Snapdragon processors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. It holds over 140,000 patents worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The Great Economic Reset promotes 5G technology, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to benefit from this growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. Qualcomm also earns significant royalty income from licensing its patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Valuation: Qualcomm is expected to produce around $9 billion in free cash flow, placing its current valuation at about 20 times earnings, which is below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. With a moderate 10% annual growth over the next 3-5 years and trading at 25 times earnings, its target value could exceed $250, offering interesting potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

#### Investment Opportunity: Equinix (EQIX)

Equinix (ticker: EQIX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) with a special tax regime in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. REITs that pay most of their profits as dividends to shareholders do not pay corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This means Equinix would not be negatively affected by a tax increase on traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Unlike typical REITs that focus on properties or office buildings, Equinix specializes in building and renting data centers that house large processors for information storage and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Many of its clients are major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

Equinix is set to benefit tremendously from the "fourth industrial revolution" as the amount of data processed and transported online is expected to increase exponentially, and Equinix provides this critical infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Its adjusted profits (FFO) tripled from $700 million in 2014 to $2.1 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

Valuation: Equinix shares currently trade at a demanding valuation of around 30 times earnings, justified by the high predictability of its business and practically assured growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. With an expected growth of at least 15% over a three-to-five-year view, its value could reach $1,400, a significant potential compared to its current $770 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### 4. Socially Committed Companies (ESG Criteria)

The Great Economic Reset promotes investment in socially committed companies, adhering to what is known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Traditionally, companies prioritized shareholders, but this new approach aims for all parties interacting with the company—social, environmental, and people—to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.

[[investment_strategies_in_changing_economic_conditions | Investment strategies in changing economic conditions]] have seen exceptional performance in companies meeting ESG criteria set by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. This is an area of the market attracting significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. Companies in the S&P 500 that meet ESG requirements have significantly outperformed those that do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. High-quality companies like Visa, UnitedHealth, and Procter & Gamble meet these sustainability criteria and are experiencing significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

### Investment Opportunity: Gold

The measures proposed by the Great Economic Reset are inflationary, requiring new money to be printed and governments to incur debt to finance large investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In an [[investment_opportunities_in_inflationary_environments | inflationary environment]], gold is an asset that tends to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Ray Dalio, a regular member of the Davos forum and manager of the world's largest investment fund, holds significant amounts of gold in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Protecting Capital and Benefiting

Despite the new measures imposed by politicians, the world generally tends towards progress and wealth generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. One of the most effective ways to capitalize on and benefit from this economic progress is through long-term [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investment in equities]] and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>. This provides a general framework for [[investment_strategies_for_uncertain_economic_times | investment strategies for uncertain economic times]] and [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | investment strategies during economic uncertainties]], helping navigate the changing economic conditions.

> The "Event 201" simulation, which occurred in October 2019, four months before the global crisis of 2020, involved government leaders, scientists, and multinationals. Its significant similarities to the actual crisis have fueled many conspiracy theories about the World Economic Forum's plans for an economic reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.

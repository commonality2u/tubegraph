## Ray Dalio's Economic Outlook

[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]], founder of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund (managing around $170 trillion), has made some "shocking statements" regarding the economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a> He believes the economy could face a situation worse than 2008, potentially resembling the Great Depression of 1929, when the market dropped 82%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>

He identified three key long-term factors that could impact investments:
1.  **The Rise of China and the Yuan as an Alternative Currency** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>
    *   China's GDP is projected to surpass the US by 2026-2027, potentially becoming the world's largest economy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>
    *   This could lead to a paradigm shift as the US dollar is the world's reserve currency, allowing the US to print money without immediate negative consequences. <a class="yt=timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
    *   The dollar's market share has declined from 66% in 2014, as confidence wanes due to continuous money printing and the rise of alternatives like the Yuan, Yen, and Euro. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>
    *   China and the Asian region are seen as areas of significant future growth due to lower taxes and a more pro-capitalist stance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>
2.  **Growing Economic Inequality** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
    *   The wealthiest 1% in the US increased their share of national wealth from 10% to over 20%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>
    *   Conversely, the poorest 50% saw their share drop from 20% to less than 14%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>
    *   This inequality can lead to the rise of populist politicians with communist tendencies, which could result in higher taxes and more business regulations, negatively impacting the economy and stock market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>
    *   Historically, periods of high taxes (like 1938-1950) were "terrible for the stock market." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>
3.  **Unprecedented Financial Experiment (Money Printing)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>
    *   There is a tremendous amount of money printing (global liquidity) happening, impacting the S&P 500. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>
    *   The correlation between global liquidity and the S&P 500 has been high in recent years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>
    *   This level of money printing is even greater than in 2008, leading to inflation reflected in rising real estate prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>

## Investment Strategies

### Ray Dalio's Approach: The All-Weather Portfolio
[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]]'s strategy, known as the "All-Weather Portfolio" or "Four Seasons Portfolio," involves investing in a diversified range of assets including stocks, bonds from emerging countries, commodities, and inflation-protected bonds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a> This portfolio is designed to perform well across various economic scenarios, whether economic growth is rising or falling, and inflation is rising or falling. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a> While he acknowledges a current liquidity bubble in fixed income, his portfolio generally aims for predictable annual returns of around 7%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>

### Warren Buffett's Approach: Quality and Liquidity
[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s strategy is simpler and more replicable for small investors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a> He does not short the market or bet against it with derivatives, as this can lead to consistent losses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>
Key aspects of his approach:
*   **Accumulating Liquidity**: [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_and_insights | Warren Buffett]] has consistently warned about expensive markets (e.g., 1969, 1999) and has accumulated significant liquidity ($130 billion in recent years) to take advantage of future opportunities during market volatility. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>
*   **Investing in High-Quality Companies**: He invests in "very good companies of high quality" that provide essential goods or services, are not cyclical, and have low debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>
*   **Prudent Valuations**: He avoids investing in excessively valued companies. When prices drop, he uses his liquidity to buy more. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>
*   **Volatility as a Friend**: [[investor_advice_and_insights_from_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] views market volatility as an opportunity to buy good companies at "ridiculous prices." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>
*   **Focus on Stocks over Bonds**: He generally recommends stocks over bonds, considering bonds to be in a "bubble" with very high valuations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>
*   **Intrinsic Value**: Risk in a stock is not determined by how much its price moves but by the difference between its intrinsic value and the buying price. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>

## Anti-Crisis Investment Ideas (Examples)

The following companies are highlighted as examples of businesses that tend to perform well during economic crises and offer long-term value, aligning with [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | successful investors']] philosophies:

### McDonald's (MCD)
*   A fast-food company whose sales often increase during crises as people seek cheaper dining options. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>
*   During the 2008 crisis (2007-2010), McDonald's operating profit increased, and its stock price rose from $45 to $70. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>
*   It is considered an "anti-crisis" stock that behaves well fundamentally and in the stock market during downturns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>
*   It grows by opening new locations (approx. 2% annually) and increasing sales at existing stores (approx. 3% annually), with good performance against inflation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>
*   Estimated annual return (combining current yield, store growth, and same-store sales growth) is around 9%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>

### GD Integrated Facilities Services (Head)
*   A smaller Canadian company (ticker: HEAD) that provides essential building maintenance services (security, cleaning, HVAC, electrical, telecom). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>
*   Its services are recurring and essential, so companies continue to pay for them even during crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>
*   Sales and operating cash flow grew by an average of 20% annually since 2008, even growing during the 2008-2009 crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>
*   Contracts are linked to inflation, allowing price increases without proportional cost increases (due to less unionization in US/Canada). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>
*   As a smaller company, it benefits from mergers and acquisitions during crises when other companies are cheaper. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>

### AutoZone (AZO)
*   A stable, safe company that sells car spare parts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:55">[00:29:55]</a>
*   In crises, people tend to repair older cars instead of buying new ones, which benefits AutoZone's business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>
*   During the 2007-2010 crisis, its earnings per share increased by 13-27% annually. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>
*   Its stock price increased from $120 in 2007 to $150 by 2010, while the overall market dropped significantly (55%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>
*   Expected annual return is estimated between 9% and 15%, based on store openings, sales growth, and current profitability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:38">[00:33:38]</a>

### Fairfax Financial Holdings (FFH)
*   Led by Prem Watsa, known as the "[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] of Canada," this company operates insurance businesses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:59">[00:33:59]</a>
*   It invests the "float" (premiums advanced by policyholders) in publicly traded or private companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:07">[00:34:07]</a>
*   Watsa maintains a cautious economic view and frequently buys hedges (derivatives) to protect against market downturns, allowing the stock to rise even when the S&P 500 falls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:30">[00:34:30]</a>
*   During the 2008 crisis, Fairfax's stock rose by almost 99% while the market was still down 16% in 2010. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>

### Open Text (OTEX)
*   A company that provides software for businesses to securely store their information (e.g., medical reports, industrial plans). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>
*   Companies will not stop paying for this essential service, making it resilient during crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>
*   Sales and profits increased significantly from 2006-2010 due to both organic growth and acquisitions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:10">[00:37:10]</a>
*   Like Head, it grows through acquisitions, which are cheaper during crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>
*   Over 80% of its revenue is recurring from licenses and maintenance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:13">[00:38:13]</a>
*   The company has a clear target to reach $1.1-1.2 billion in free cash flow by 2024, implying significant future growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>

### Samsung Electronics (SSNLF)
*   A large Asian company, particularly strong in microchips and RAM memory manufacturing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:16">[00:47:16]</a>
*   The global shortage of microchips benefits Samsung, with record sales and an estimated tight market for 1-2 more years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:19">[00:47:19]</a>
*   Korean stocks like Samsung were historically cheap due to poor shareholder treatment, but this has changed, with increased share buybacks and dividends, leading to market recognition. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:53">[00:46:53]</a>
*   It is currently trading at a reasonable 10x earnings and possesses significant liquidity, making it potentially cheaper than competitors like Micron. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:27">[00:48:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>

### Moody's (MCO)
*   A credit rating agency, part of an "oligopoly" with Standard & Poor's. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>
*   Companies seeking to issue bonds at lower interest rates must be rated by at least two of the three main agencies (Moody's, Fitch, S&P). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>
*   This creates a high-margin, essential service business, as the fee charged is small compared to the interest savings for bond issuers. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:04">[00:50:04]</a>
*   Moody's does not suffer significantly during crises; in fact, debt issuance increases during economic downturns, benefiting the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:41">[00:51:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>
*   It benefits from global debt growth (5% annually) and its ability to raise client prices (another 5% annually), plus share buybacks (3-4% rector's ment), leading to expected returns of 13-15%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:04">[00:52:04]</a>

### Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)
*   Manages private equity funds, similar to investment funds, charging clients a percentage and investing their own capital alongside. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>
*   The company has a plan to reach $5/share in profit by 2024-2025, and these types of companies often trade at 20x earnings, implying a path to $100/share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>
*   The sector is growing because private equity funds offer a good alternative for institutions (insurance, governments, pension plans) to generate stable returns as fixed income becomes less attractive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>
*   Brookfield has a strong track record of fulfilling forecasts, with assets under management growing significantly. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:43">[01:18:43]</a>

### Other Mentioned Companies
*   **ACS (ACS)**: A Spanish construction company considered cheap (approx. 10x earnings), with a generous dividend yield (7-8%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:31">[01:32:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>
*   **Green Brick Partners (GRBK)**: A US homebuilder focused on southern states with high growth expectations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:17">[01:32:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:27">[01:32:27]</a> The US housing market currently has historically low inventory, suggesting several years of strong building demand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>
*   **The St. Joe Company (JOE)**: The largest landowner in Florida, benefiting from population migration and teleworking trends that are driving up real estate prices in the state. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:37">[01:25:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:50">[01:25:50]</a>
*   **NVR (NVR)**: Considered one of the best US construction companies, with a unique business model that has allowed it to grow steadily even during the housing crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>
*   **Kindred Group (KIND-SDB.ST)**: An online gaming (sports betting) company that has performed well since the crisis, benefiting from the shift to online and operating in regulated markets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>
*   **Pollard Banknote (PBL)** and **NeoGames (NGMS)**: Companies involved in traditional and online lottery. NeoGames benefits from the authorization of online lottery in US states, with strong growth potential. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:08">[01:09:08]</a>
*   **Caixa (HK: 2120)**: A Chinese company providing building maintenance services in a rapidly growing sector due to population growth, GDP growth, and government mandates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>

### General Investment Philosophy
The speaker advocates for an [[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | investment style]] that is low-risk and generates predictable returns, focusing on "asymmetric investments" with very little downside and significant upside. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a> This approach helps maintain mental and emotional security, allowing investors to hold large positions in a concentrated portfolio of 8-10 high-quality companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:02">[01:40:02]</a> This is contrasted with speculative investments like Virgin Galactic, which are difficult to value and carry high risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:08">[01:33:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a> The goal is to build a portfolio that can perform well in various market conditions, allowing for peaceful sleep without constant stress. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:13">[01:52:13]</a>

It is emphasized that investing is not a casino; it has a "science behind it," where real businesses are reflected in the stock market, and good business performance typically leads to positive stock performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:49">[01:43:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:53">[01:43:53]</a>

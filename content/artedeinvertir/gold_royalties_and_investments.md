The [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_bonds | gold]] sector generally performs well during periods of [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | inflation]], including gold futures, physical gold, and gold mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:25">[09:34:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:13:58">[22:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:16:32">[22:16:32]</a>.

## Challenges with Traditional Gold Mining Companies
Traditional gold mining companies can be problematic because if [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | inflation]] does not occur, gold prices and mining company stocks may perform poorly, experiencing significant declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:21:20">[22:21:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:25:20">[22:25:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:26:59">[26:00:34]</a>. Historically, from 2007 to 2021, gold mining companies have shown a negative return, making it challenging to invest in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:58:39">[25:58:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:00:34">[26:00:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:08:44">[26:08:44]</a>.

## Gold Royalty Companies: A Solution
A segment of the gold sector, known as gold royalty companies, has historically performed very well on the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:30:17">[22:30:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:32:38">[22:32:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:20">[22:36:20]</a>.

### How They Work
Gold mining companies often face significant difficulties securing traditional financing for their projects, as banks are usually reluctant to provide capital due to a lack of trust and high demands for money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:36">[22:42:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:43:24">[22:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:50:52">[22:50:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:05:40">[23:05:40]</a>.

Gold royalty companies specialize in providing this financing. They possess greater expertise than traditional banks in assessing the value of mining projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:09:05">[23:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:32:15">[23:32:15]</a>. In return for financing, gold mining companies pay them with a percentage of future gold production from the mine, not in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:07:07">[24:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:11:32">[24:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:19:40">[24:19:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:22:20">[24:22:20]</a>. This creates a win-win scenario where mining companies secure financing and royalty companies benefit from a stream of income tied to gold production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:12:00">[24:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:15:00">[24:15:00]</a>.

### Key Characteristics and Advantages
Gold royalty companies, such as Franco-Nevada, Same Store Gold, and Royal Gold, operate as an oligopoly where three or four major players dominate the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:12:00">[23:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:13:30">[23:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:17:40">[23:17:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:21:40">[23:21:40]</a>.

They align with [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]]'s "toll bridge" metaphor for good [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:15">[10:00:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:25:24">[24:25:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:46">[24:28:46]</a>:
*   **Initial Investment ('Old Dollars')**: They make their initial [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] (financing mines) with "old dollars," meaning the bulk of the capital outlay is in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:43:24">[24:43:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:45:50">[24:45:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:50:00">[24:50:00]</a>.
*   **No Recurring Large Investments**: Unlike mining companies that constantly need to invest in new production, royalty companies do not have to finance new mines, allowing their income to rise without increasing costs due to [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:40:09">[24:40:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:49:50">[24:49:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:09:40">[25:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:46">[25:10:46]</a>.
*   **Predictable Cash Flow**: Mines produce a relatively predictable amount of gold, which contributes to stable revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:33:04">[24:33:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:05:08">[25:05:08]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**: As [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | inflation]] rises, the value of the gold royalties they receive increases, while their fixed costs remain largely the same, leading to soaring profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:10:46">[25:10:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:12:00">[25:12:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Performance in Varied Environments**: These companies can perform well in various economic conditions, including periods of low [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | inflation]] or sideways/bearish gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:40">[24:44:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:46:50">[24:46:50]</a>. For example, Franco-Nevada's shares went from $30 to $60-$80 during 2014-2018, a period of low [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:23:42">[25:23:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:34:25">[25:34:25]</a>.

### Performance of Franco-Nevada
Franco-Nevada, since its inception on the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] (around 2007), has delivered an average annual return of 20%, outperforming the NASDAQ, S&P 500, gold itself, and traditional gold mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:41:40">[25:41:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:44:00">[25:44:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:57:30">[25:57:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>.

> [!INFO]
> From 2013, Franco-Nevada has multiplied its value by 20 times, representing an average annual growth rate of 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:09:40">[59:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="59:13:30">[59:13:30]</a>.

The company's revenue has grown from $400 million to $1.2 billion, an 11% annual growth rate, and its normalized profit has grown at 15% annually, leading to its strong [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:59:18">[26:59:18]</a>.

The sector of gold royalty companies is considered desirable for [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | investment]], as most companies within it tend to perform well on the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:20:44">[26:20:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:22:20">[26:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:31:00">[26:31:00]</a>.

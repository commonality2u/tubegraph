Learning to invest effectively often involves studying and applying the techniques of some of the world's [[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | most successful investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This article explores the [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investment strategies and philosophies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> of legendary Wall Street investors David Tepper and Bill Ackman, offering [[investment_strategies_and_advice | advice]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> on how to navigate challenging market conditions.

## David Tepper: The Contrarian Billionaire

David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, boasts one of the best track records in money management over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. His success led him to accumulate a fortune of $12 billion, returning all client capital last year to focus solely on his own [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. Over three decades, he generated an impressive annual return of 25% for clients, surpassing even [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a> returns during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

### Tepper's Core Strategy: Buying in Panic

Tepper is renowned as one of Wall Street's "bravest printers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. Similar to [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>, he is among the first to buy stocks during times of widespread market panic when other investors are hesitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>. His best years for returns consistently followed these periods of market panic, allowing him to invest at highly attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>. He publicly recommended investing in years like 2001, 2009, and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

### Insights from a CNBC Interview

In a recent telephone interview with CNBC, Tepper shared his perspective on the market:
*   **Market Outlook**: He suggested the market could fall an additional 10-15% if investor panic persists due to economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. However, he added that if the US Congress approved a package of measures, it could signal "the end of the falls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>.
*   **Selective Investing**: When asked if he was buying shares, Tepper responded, "What shares?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. This highlights his belief that investors should not buy just any stock, regardless of how much it has fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quality**: He emphasized investing in "good companies" with a solid competitive position and low debt, as weaker, indebted companies may not survive economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. Such companies are expected to emerge stronger, increasing their market share and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.
*   **Current Buys**: Tepper disclosed buying stocks in the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a> and large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. These companies meet his criteria of strong competitive positions and no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### Example: Airbus (AIR)

Airbus, listed in France under the ticker A&R, is an example of a company fitting Tepper's criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **High Quality, Temporary Problem**: It's a high-quality company currently at the "epicenter of the storm" due to reduced airline activity, making its shares unpopular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] often advises investing in such companies when temporary problems offer attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>.
*   **Oligopoly**: The commercial aviation business is an oligopoly dominated by Boeing and Airbus, a trend expected to continue for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>.
*   **Predictable Business & Low Debt**: Airbus has a highly predictable business with an order book of 8,000 aircraft, equivalent to seven years of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. It also maintains a liquidity surplus of $12 billion, or 20% of its market capitalization, after discounting debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Historically, high-quality, predictable growth companies like Airbus rarely trade below 20x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. With current earnings around €6 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>, a normalized P/E of 20x suggests a valuation of €120 per share once the crisis subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>. Looking 5 years ahead, potential earnings of €8 per share could lead to a valuation near €200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:00">[10:34:00]</a>.

### Example: United Healthcare (UNH)

United Healthcare (UNH) is a leading company in offering private healthcare plans in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.
*   **Defensive Oligopoly**: It operates in a defensive oligopoly controlled by four companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. People rarely cancel health insurance, making it resilient during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. The company increased sales and profits even during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
*   **Low Debt & Consistent Growth**: United Healthcare has low debt and is expected to grow 5-10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: With recent earnings of $15 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>, and expected earnings over $20 per share in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>, a target P/E of 20x for such a high-quality, predictable business suggests a valuation over $400 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>.

## Bill Ackman: From Bear to Bull

Bill Ackman, another legendary Wall Street investor, has generated annual returns exceeding 16% for his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He has accumulated a personal fortune of over $1.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Ackman has gained a reputation for effectively navigating bearish periods, notably losing only 13% with his fund in 2008 while the S&P 500 lost almost 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

### Aggressive Buying Amidst Market Shift

In a statement to investors on Friday, March 27th, Ackman declared a shift from being "super bearish" to "bullish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Consequently, he began aggressively buying shares of Hilton, Restaurant Brands, and Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

### Example: Restaurant Brands International (QSR)

Restaurant Brands International (QSR) owns iconic brands like Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a>. Its shares fell 50% from their highs due to the economic shutdown impacting restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Resilient Business Model**: Fast food stocks historically provide excellent returns as more people eat out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Their low-priced menus make them resilient during economic crises; McDonald's, for example, increased sales during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:33:00">[13:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>.
*   **Royalty-Based Operations**: Restaurant Brands International primarily receives royalties from franchisees rather than operating restaurants directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:45:00">[13:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:51:00">[13:51:00]</a>. This business model requires less investment and is considered superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>.
*   **Debt and Risk Mitigation**: While the company carries some debt, like other resilient fast-food chains, the US government's commitment to help small business owners has mitigated part of this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation and Growth Potential**: The company generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:09:00">[15:09:00]</a>. Compared to its $11.7 billion market capitalization, this represents an attractive 8x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:00">[15:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:25:00">[15:25:00]</a>. Fast food companies rarely trade below 15x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. With projected earnings returning to $2.4 billion, a 15x multiple yields a target value of $80 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:00">[15:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. The plan to increase restaurants from 26,000 to 40,000 in the next five years could boost profits from $1.4 billion to $2 billion annually, leading to a target value of $120 per share in 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:14:00">[16:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:30:00">[16:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.

The world of the stock market and investments has gained significant popularity over the last two years, attracting many new participants and, unfortunately, unscrupulous individuals looking to exploit others through sophisticated deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is crucial to understand these methods to [[common_scams_in_stock_market_investments | avoid them in time]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## How Recommendation Scams Work

One prevalent [[common_scams_in_stock_market_investments | scam]] involves false [[stock_investment_advice | recommendations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This method targets investors by:

1.  **Contact Acquisition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>: The scammer obtains email or telephone contacts of a large group of investors, for instance, 10,000 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.
2.  **Dividing Groups and Opposite Recommendations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>:
    *   The group is divided into two (e.g., 5,000 investors each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
    *   One group receives a recommendation for a stock to go up (e.g., Amazon) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.
    *   The second group receives the opposite recommendation, that the same stock will go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Since the stock market allows benefiting from both rises and falls, one recommendation will always be "correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  **Repeating the Process** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>: At the end of the week, the scammer takes the group that received the "approached" recommendation (e.g., 5,000 investors) and divides them again into two smaller groups <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This process is repeated over several weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
4.  **Creating the Illusion of Expertise** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>: After approximately four weeks, a small subset of the original contacts (e.g., 625 out of 10,000) will have received a "perfect recommendation" week after week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. These individuals will believe the scammer is an infallible expert, like the "new [[investment_advice_and_strategies_from_top_investors | Warren Buffett]] of the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

## The Payoff Phase of the Scam

Once trust is established, the scam typically proceeds in one of two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:

1.  **Selling "Magical Recommendations"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>: The scammer will demand a significant sum of money for the right to continue receiving these "magical" [[stock_investment_advice | recommendations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
    *   **Outcome**: The recommendations provided will yield mediocre or below-average results, as the scammers are not genuine experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
2.  **Money Management Scheme** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>: Investors are asked to deposit money into an account that the scammer will manage, promising to multiply it with their "miraculous abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   **Outcome 1**: The deposited cash disappears within weeks, and the scammers cease all contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   **Outcome 2**: The scammers operate the money through brokers affiliated with their dubious organization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. By generating numerous operations and commissions, the investor's money is ultimately lost in favor of these brokers or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> If someone promises you high returns on the stock market without risk, or asks you to attract new people to their "business opportunity" to increase your returns, exercise extreme distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. Such scenarios are often signs of a scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Always seek entities regulated by the highest stock market authority in your country for investing your money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.

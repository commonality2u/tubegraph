The world of the [[stock_market_scams_and_how_to_detect_them | stock market and investments]] has seen a significant increase in popularity over the last two years, attracting many new individuals interested in these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This surge has also drawn unscrupulous people looking to acquire others' money through complex deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. Scammers' methods have become increasingly sophisticated, making it crucial to understand their techniques to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## How Recommendation Scams Work

One of the most dangerous [[stock_market_scams_and_how_to_detect_them | scams]] in the world of [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investments]] is based on false recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This method targets individuals interested in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

The process typically unfolds as follows:
1.  **Contact Acquisition**: The scammer obtains email or telephone contacts of a large group of potential investors, for example, 10,000 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.
2.  **Dividing Groups and Conflicting Recommendations**: These contacts are divided into two groups (e.g., 5,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. One group receives a recommendation that a stock (like Amazon) will go up, while the other group receives the opposite recommendation, that the stock will go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Since the stock market allows benefiting from both rises and falls, one of these recommendations will inevitably be correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
3.  **Repeating the Process**: At the end of the week, the scammer identifies the group whose recommendation was correct (e.g., 5,000 investors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This successful group is then divided again into two smaller groups (e.g., 2,500 each), and the process is repeated with new, conflicting recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
4.  **Creating the Illusion of Expertise**: After approximately four weeks, out of the initial 10,000 individuals, a smaller group (e.g., 625 people) will have received a perfect recommendation week after week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These individuals will then believe the scammer is an extraordinary expert, akin to the "new [[investor_advice_and_insights_from_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]]" of the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### The Scam's Execution

Once trust is established, the scam begins, typically with two options:
*   **Payment for Continued Recommendations**: The scammer may demand a large sum of money for the right to continue receiving these "magical" future recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. The recommendations received afterwards will likely yield mediocre or below-average results, as the scammers are not legitimate experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Depositing Money for Managed Accounts**: Alternatively, victims may be asked to deposit money into an account that will be managed by the scammer, promising miraculous multiplication of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In this scenario:
    *   The deposited cash may disappear within weeks, with no further contact from the scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   The scammers might operate the money through affiliated brokers of dubious reputation, generating many operations and commissions, ultimately leading to the loss of all the victim's money in favor of these brokers or organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

## General Warning Signs to Avoid Scams

While recommendation scams have a specific pattern, several general red flags apply to all [[stock_market_scams_and_how_to_detect_them | investment scams]]:

*   **Promises of High Returns Without Risk**: Be extremely wary of anyone who promises high returns on the stock market without any risk. This simply does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.
*   **Recruitment for "Exponential" Benefits**: If increasing your returns also requires you to attract new people to a "business opportunity," your distrust should be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This is a common characteristic of [[pyramid_schemes_in_stock_market_investments | pyramid schemes]], which are often disguised with a product or service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.
*   **Unrealistic Daily/Monthly Returns**: Promises like "1% daily" or "15% monthly" are completely unrealistic, equating to an annual return of 3700% or multiplying capital by 37 times in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Such systems do not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.
*   **Unregulated Entities**: When choosing a company to invest your money, ensure it is regulated by the highest stock market authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For example, in Spain, the CNMV is the highest regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **"Infallible Methods" or Trading Robots**: Claims of infallible methods to beat the market, often adorned with luxury items, or offers of "trading robots" that generate automatic profits consistently, are typically scams <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Real powerful algorithms are developed by large institutions (e.g., Bank of America, JP Morgan) for their own benefit and are not sold to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **[[fake_wealth_management_advisory_companies | Fake Wealth Management Advisory Companies]]**: Be cautious of companies that contact you by phone using high-pressure sales techniques, especially if they offer to deposit money into an account in your name to demonstrate their method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. These are often manipulative tactics using falsified statements and colluding brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Unverifiable Credentials**: Be wary of individuals claiming to be professional investors who managed funds in exotic jurisdictions (like Panama or Cayman Islands) or who claim to manage a "family office" without established legal figures for managing others' money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. These individuals often lack the necessary qualifications and experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> The most important thing for avoiding falling into the net of these scammers is not letting yourself be carried away by greed and thinking that no one is going to give you something in return for nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

If you are planning to invest, this information is crucial as you are likely to encounter such scammers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

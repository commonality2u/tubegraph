The Great Economic Reset is a new economic scenario proposed by the World Economic Forum that is expected to affect everyone globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This movement aims for a total transformation of society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Its proponents claim it is an idyllic and beneficial reform, though some aspects may not be positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Origin and Key Figures

The concept of the Great Economic Reset is largely attributed to Klaus Schwab, the founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The WEF is described as a non-profit NGO that includes some of the most powerful people in the world, such as heads of government and prominent businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Notable members include Xi Jinping, Vladimir Putin, Joe Biden, Bill Gates, and George Soros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

The most visible aspect of the WEF is the annual Davos World Economic Forum, held every January in the Swiss Alps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Access to this event can cost between $13,000 and $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The Davos Forum 2021 was a key event where global leaders met to launch this new economic initiative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The stated excuse for this economic reform is the ongoing global crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Klaus Schwab has also published a book outlining his future plans for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Core Reforms

The Great Economic Reset focuses fundamentally on three areas: social, economic, and environmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. Given the capitalist system, all reforms revolve around new economic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Tax Increases

One of the primary proposals is a significant increase in taxes for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.
This is driven by two main reasons:
1.  **Government Debt**: Governments have become highly indebted following recent crises and need more tax revenue to repay debts issued to support the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Sector Promotion**: Increased taxes will fund sectors recommended by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

This tax increase mechanism appears to be underway in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve president and incoming Treasury Secretary, has stated that the recovery plan will prioritize raising taxes on the wealthy, who benefited from 2017 tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Yellen even suggested taxing unrealized profits in the stock market, which could discourage investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

Donald Trump's 2017 tax cuts led to accelerated profits for S&P 500 companies and a bullish stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Reversing these cuts could have an opposite, negative effect, with some analysts estimating a 15-20% drop in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Focus on Environment and Carbon Emissions

The Great Economic Reset promotes environmental initiatives, particularly the concept of "zero emissions balance" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. This involves:
*   Providing substantial aid to the renewable and clean energy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   Creating new taxes to discourage the use of highly polluting energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The Davos 2021 forum agenda extensively covered renewable energies and carbon emissions, with attendees like Bill Gates and Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The Biden administration has committed over $2 trillion in aid to the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This focus has led to strong performance in this sector on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

The plan also discourages investment in polluting energies like oil and coal, which have performed poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This has created new investment opportunities in areas like electric cars (e.g., Tesla), wind generation (e.g., Gamesa, Siemens), and solar energy (e.g., Jinko Solar, Canadian Solar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

ETFs related to clean energy, such as the Nasdaq Clean Energy (ticker CELS) listed in the US, have seen significant demand, rising over 300% in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. European equivalents like the Eye Search Global Clean Energy have also performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### The Fourth Industrial Revolution (New Technologies)

Another reform is the promotion of "the fourth industrial revolution," which emphasizes new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The Davos forum dedicated an entire day to this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. The European Union's official website shows major aid allocated for innovation and technological development, totaling over 140 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This forces governments and companies to invest in new technological projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

This focus has significantly benefited the Nasdaq and technology stocks in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Large American technology companies like Facebook, Google, and Amazon are among the most beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. These companies are considered to have high profits, good growth prospects, and are less negatively affected by potential US tax increases due to declaring taxes abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

#### Investment Opportunity: Qualcomm

Qualcomm (ticker QCOM) is a leading technology company listed in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. It specializes in microchips and processors, especially for smartphones with its Snapdragon processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Qualcomm holds over 140,000 patents worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

The Great Economic Reset's agenda promotes 5G technology, positioning Qualcomm to benefit from this growth phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The company also earns significant income from licensing its patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Valued using free cash flow, Qualcomm's current valuation is around 20 times earnings, which is below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. With moderate growth of 10% per year and a target of 25 times earnings, its value could reach over $250, a significant realization potential from its current $160 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

#### Investment Opportunity: Equinix

Equinix (ticker EQIX) is a real estate investment trust (REIT) listed in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. REITs have a special tax regime in the US: if they pay the majority of their profits as dividends to shareholders, they do not pay corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This means Equinix would not be negatively affected by potential tax increases on traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

Unlike typical REITs that buy and rent properties, Equinix specializes in building and renting data centers that house processors for storing and processing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Many of its clients are major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>. Equinix is poised to benefit from the Fourth Industrial Revolution due to the exponential increase in data processing and transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Its adjusted profits (FFO) tripled in less than six years, from $700 million in 2014 to $2.1 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. Although trading at a demanding valuation of 30 times earnings, this is justified by the business's predictability and assured growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. With expected growth of at least 15%, its value could reach $1,400 from its current $770 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.

### Promotion of Socially Committed Companies (ESG Criteria)

The Great Economic Reset also promotes investment in companies that are socially committed, aligning with Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Traditionally, companies prioritized shareholders, but this new approach aims for all stakeholders (social, environmental, and people) to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Companies meeting ESG criteria, as set by the World Economic Forum, have shown exceptional performance and are attracting significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. S&P 500 companies meeting ESG requirements have outperformed those that do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. Examples of high-quality ESG companies include Visa, United Health, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

### Event 201 and Conspiracy Theories

A controversial event that has generated distrust towards the World Economic Forum and the Great Economic Reset is "Event 201," which occurred in October 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. This simulation, involving government leaders, scientists, and large multinationals, coincidentally had enormous similarities to the global crisis experienced in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>. This has led to numerous conspiracy theories about the WEF's plans for an [[Economic Recession Indicators and Predictions | economic reset]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

### Inflationary Measures and Gold

The proposed measures of the Great Economic Reset are considered [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflationary]] because financing large investments often requires printing new money and increasing government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In an [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflationary]] environment, gold tends to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Ray Dalio, a regular at the Davos forum and manager of the world's largest investment fund, coincidentally has significant investments in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.

## Personal Advice

Despite new measures imposed by politicians, the world generally tends towards improvement and wealth generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. One of the most effective ways to capitalize on and benefit from this economic progress is through long-term investment in stocks and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.

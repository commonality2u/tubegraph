[[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]] holds a concentrated portfolio exceeding $40 billion, with 80-90% of it in just six stocks, including John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. This article explores his [[investment_opportunities_related_to_agriculture | investment opportunities related to agriculture]] in the company.

## Bill Gates's Investment Rationale
[[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]] has maintained a very bullish outlook on food production in recent years, citing potential shortages and the planet's increasing population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. Beyond investing in agricultural equipment companies like John Deere, he is also one of the largest landowners in the United States, actively accumulating farmland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This strategy aligns with [[bill_gates_reasons_for_investing_in_farmland | Bill Gates's reasons for investing in farmland]] and his belief in long-term trends affecting basic necessities.

## Market Leadership and Technological Edge
John Deere, an industrial machinery company, represents 3.7% of [[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]]'s portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. A common element in [[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]]'s investments is targeting market leaders, not second or third-best companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. John Deere holds a significant market share compared to competitors like ACO or Case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, with surveys indicating that 60% of American farmers utilize their machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Its leadership is attributed to its technological capacity, quality-price ratio, and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

### Integration of Artificial Intelligence
Despite being in a traditional sector like agriculture, John Deere is significantly benefiting from [[fourth_industrial_revolution_and_technological_investments | technological advances]] and Artificial Intelligence (AI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The company manufactures self-piloted tractors where farmers can mark land via GPS, allowing the tractors to work autonomously, even returning to storage sheds after completion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. These intelligent systems can detect objects or animals and automatically stop, sending alerts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. This technology provides a significant competitive advantage, enabling John Deere to charge more for products that save farmers time and labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Developing such advanced systems requires substantial investment, which John Deere, with its financial strength, can finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. The company spends nearly $2 billion annually on research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Business Cyclicality and Financial Health
The agricultural machinery business is cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. Farmers tend to delay new machinery purchases when raw material prices are low or their earnings are down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. However, when economic conditions improve and farmers are profitable, they are more willing to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Since the COVID-19 pandemic, the inflation crisis has significantly benefited food and raw material prices, leading to a strong rise in John Deere's stock, from which [[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]] has benefited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

Despite cyclicality, John Deere has consistently been a profitable company, generating cash flow through various economic cycles due to prudent management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. For dividend investors, it is one of the stocks that has continuously increased dividends for over 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, with a 64% increase since 2020, paid quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Profit margins from equipment sales have risen to 15% (from 7-8% in 2013), with some suggesting this is an "overinvestment" period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. However, a scenario similar to 2000-2007, where high profitability lasted for many years, could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. [[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]] appears to hold a positive view on this future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Future Outlook and Valuation
The agricultural equipment sector is estimated to grow at a rate of 7% annually, more than double the general economy's 3% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. As a strong brand, John Deere could grow even faster than the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. [[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]] is likely eyeing growth of over 10%, combined with dividends or share buybacks, to achieve a double-digit shareholder return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

Currently, John Deere's valuation has dropped to only 11 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, close to its COVID-19 pandemic lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. While it previously traded at up to 25 times earnings, its current valuation is considered attractive given its strong fundamentals and the positive outlook for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>. The company's strategy allows it to not only grow sales but also expand profit margins, leading to higher earnings per share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>. This aligns with [[influential_investment_figures | Bill Gates]]'s preference for companies with strong growth plans in terms of profit, even if sales growth is more moderate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a>.

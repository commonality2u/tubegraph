He has begun divesting a large portion of his stock portfolio, indicating a belief that a [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risk]] could be more severe than recent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Predictive Role and Economic Outlook

Bill Gates has a history of accurately forecasting economic challenges. In 2019, he warned of a crisis similar to a [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | recent one]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. His investment foresight is also notable, with early investments in companies like Novavax and BioNTech, and a prediction that Pfizer and BioNTech would develop a solution to the "current problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>.

He currently holds only 2% of his assets in Microsoft shares, having significantly diversified his wealth into other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. His deep understanding of the economy and technology sectors has led many investors to closely monitor his financial movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Identified Threats and Concerns

During an annual security conference in Munich, Bill Gates outlined factors causing him concern:
*   **Future Pandemics** He anticipates another pandemic with a different pathogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
*   **Distrust in Governments** He is concerned about the public's distrust in governments, which could hinder rapid responses to future crises, requiring action in less than six months instead of two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   **Social Media Division** Social networks are seen as contributing to division within society and the [[impact_on_global_financial_markets | economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
*   **Bioterrorism** A significant worry is terrorist attacks involving smallpox strains that could be spread in public places <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He has called for governments to establish a common fund of over $1 billion annually for monitoring this [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Response to Risks

Bill Gates' investment actions reflect his concerns about these [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Transparency rules in the United States require investors with over $100 million to disclose their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

His recent portfolio adjustments include:
*   **Massive Selling of Shares** He has sold 12 of his 18 stock holdings and has not purchased any new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This accelerated sale is attributed to a belief that "we may not yet have seen the worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   **Divesting from Cyclical Companies** Sales have focused on cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere, which are sensitive to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.
*   **Reducing Tech Exposure** He sold all his Google shares, with Microsoft being the only remaining tech holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. This move has been successful, as the Nasdaq technology index plummeted over 30% in the first five months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Previously, he sold all his Alibaba shares before their significant decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.
*   **Exiting [[transport_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | Transportation Sector]]** He sold shares in UPS, FedEx, and Canadian Pacific Railway, realizing excellent profits from these investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
*   **Betting Against Tesla** Bill Gates has begun betting against Tesla shares, possibly due to their high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. Tesla shares have plummeted more than 50% on the stock market recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

## Protected Investments

Despite his cautious stance, Bill Gates maintains a portfolio of companies in predictable and defensive sectors, aiming to minimize the impact of an [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | economic crisis]] and counteract [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. These include:
*   **Ecolab (ECL)**: A company focused on water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection services, known for its high competitive advantage and consistent earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. It has shown resilience in crises like 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Waste Management (WM)**: The leading garbage collection company in the United States, operating in a predictable, crisis-resistant sector that benefits from trends in waste recycling and environmental protection <a class="yt>00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola FEMSA**: The national bottler of Coca-Cola for Mexico, categorized as a defensive and predictable business aligning with his conservative investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.
*   **Farmland**: Bill Gates has become the largest landowner in the United States, a move that proved successful just before the recent rise in food prices and global [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

He has also recently sold shares of Walmart, which suffered from supply chain issues and [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

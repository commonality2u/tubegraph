This article provides an [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | analysis of specific stocks]] and sectors, drawing insights from prominent investors and market trends. The speaker emphasizes how looking at what the best investors are currently buying can generate investment ideas for stocks with interesting potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. However, it is crucial for individuals to conduct their own [[analyzing_stock_opportunities | analysis]] and monitoring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Investment Strategy Overview
The speaker's approach involves:
*   **Learning from Top Investors**: Observing what investors with the best historical results are purchasing, as these stocks have likely passed a filter of someone who understands the market well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>.
*   **Understanding the "Why"**: Not just knowing *what* they are buying, but *why* they are investing in those particular stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Disclosing any personal holdings in discussed stocks for full transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Popular Stocks Among Top Investors
Several prominent stocks are identified as being popular among "strong hands" or "best investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>:

### Financial and Payment Services
*   **Visa / Mastercard**: These are considered very good companies with great competitive advantages, capable of yielding a return between 10% and 15% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. The speaker's funds hold both Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Marsh & McLennan Companies**: An insurance broker recognized as one of the best companies in its sector, often generating good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The speaker's funds also hold this stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **Wells Fargo**: This bank is highlighted because the financial sector is one of the few that remains cheap or trading below its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. It has performed well in the last nine months, starting from a "ridiculous valuation point" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>.
    *   **Valuation Metrics**: When analyzing banks, metrics like net income, book value, and tangible book value are used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Wells Fargo has a return on tangible book value of 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
    *   **Current Standing**: It is currently trading at 1.1 times its tangible book value, suggesting it could be worth more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Expected earnings per share could reach $4.50 in two years, potentially leading to a valuation range of $60 to $75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. The company returns money to shareholders through share buybacks and dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.

### Technology and E-commerce
*   **Amazon**: While large technology companies haven't seen significant growth in the last year compared to smaller tech stocks, Amazon is a great company that has benefited from accelerated online shopping adoption during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. It is estimated to be trading at 12-15 times free cash flow, which is considered undervalued for its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>. The speaker's funds hold Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:11">[01:13:11]</a>.
*   **Alibaba**: A highly popular stock, notably bought by Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner) and Li Lu, who Munger considers the "Warren Buffett of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. The company is expected to grow at 20% in 2022-2023 and has no debt, holding $100 billion in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>. It is valued by free cash flow per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Currently trading at less than 20 times earnings, which is considered cheap given its quality and growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.## Analysis of Specific Stocks and Sectors

*   **Alibaba**: A highly popular stock, notably bought by Charlie Munger (Warren Buffett's partner) and Li Lu, who Munger considers the "Warren Buffett of China" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. The company is expected to grow at 20% in 2022-2023 and has no debt, holding $100 billion in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>. It is valued by free cash flow per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:52">[01:18:52]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Currently trading at less than 20 times earnings, which is considered cheap given its quality and growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>. Its current value could be around $270 per share, with potential to reach $350 in 2-3 years and $500 in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:56">[01:19:56]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: Possesses a strong competitive advantage with deeply integrated products (Office, Windows, gaming) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:59">[01:22:59]</a>. Its migration to a cloud-based business model has allowed for more aggressive price increases and expanded margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.
    *   **Growth Drivers**: Sales growth (over 10% annually), margin expansion (from 30% to 41%), and share buybacks (3-5% per year) contribute to significant earnings per share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:31">[01:24:31]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Expected to earn $16-18 per share by the end of 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:51">[01:26:51]</a>. With a typical trading multiple of 25 times earnings, this suggests a target price of $400-$500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:10">[01:27:10]</a>.
*   **Facebook / Google**: Mentioned as large technology companies often inquired about, with their [[analysis_of_specific_stocks_in_the_healthcare_and_technology_sectors | analysis]] and valuations discussed in previous webinars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Facebook was identified as the most popular stock this quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:38">[01:27:38]</a>.

#### Healthcare
*   **UnitedHealth**: Considered one of the best insurers in the US healthcare sector, a very high-quality and predictable company that grows through an aging population and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:08">[01:21:08]</a>.
*   **CVS Health (CVX)**: People were wary of healthcare companies due to Amazon's initiatives, but these companies have strong competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. Historically, companies like CVS traded at 15-20 times earnings, but recently fell to 8 times, now rebounding to 10 times, still offering upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>. Debt reduction from acquisitions is expected to boost earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>.

### Smaller, Less Known Companies
Private investors have an advantage over large funds in investing in smaller, less known companies, as these can offer better results due to managing less capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

*   **PAR Technology (PAR)**: A company providing terminals for restaurants and managing data in the cloud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:52">[01:30:52]</a>. The speaker's fund started buying it at $15, and it's now at $65 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:22">[01:31:22]</a>.
*   **Up and Group (UPG)**: An industrial services company focused on fire safety systems and building maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:15">[01:34:15]</a>.
    *   **Business Model**: Provides critical, non-cyclical services with recurring revenue, growing organically at 5-7% annually, plus acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Expected to generate $1.50 free cash flow per share this year, with a reasonable valuation of 20 times, leading to a current share value of $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. With projected growth, free cash flow could reach $2.50-$3.00 by 2025, yielding a target price of $38-$60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:09">[01:39:09]</a>.
*   **Baidu**: A Chinese technology company similar to Alibaba, but even cheaper and with significant return potential, despite slightly lower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:14">[01:41:14]</a>.
*   **ASOS**: Mentioned as a high-growth stock that loses money, illustrative of companies requiring significant marketing investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. The valuation of such companies is highly volatile due to uncertain profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:30">[01:44:30]</a>.
*   **Barry Global (BERY)**: A plastic packaging manufacturing company, a seemingly "boring" sector, yet highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:23">[01:51:23]</a>.
    *   **Competitive Advantages**: Local businesses due to high transport costs for finished products, making it difficult for new competitors to enter controlled territories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>.
    *   **Performance**: Strong free cash flow growth (from $240M to $940M) and adjusted EPS growth (from $1 to $5 in 7 years), averaging 20% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:21">[01:53:21]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Trading at a low 10 times free cash flow, while comparable technology companies with similar growth trade at 40-50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:54">[01:53:54]</a>. Expected free cash flow of $10-11 by 2025 could yield a valuation of $150-$165, more than double its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:11">[01:55:11]</a>.
*   **DGT**: An IT/software company, specifically dealing with spin-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:10">[01:57:10]</a>.

*   **Nagarro (NA9)**: A German small-cap IT/software company that has seen significant price appreciation, likely due to its upcoming inclusion in the DAX index for small companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Index inclusion leads to forced buying by ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>.
*   **TMMT Group**: A restaurant company that initially saw a decline due to pandemic lockdowns, especially in Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:47">[01:14:47]</a>. However, its US operations have performed better than pre-crisis levels as smaller competitors went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:47">[01:15:47]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Expected to earn $120-$130 million, trading at 11-12 times earnings, below its historical average of 16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>. With continued growth, earnings could reach $250 million in 5 years, suggesting a valuation of $160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:54">[01:16:54]</a>.
*   **Miquel y Costas**: A Spanish company producing thin paper for tobacco and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:11">[01:32:11]</a>. While one segment is declining, the company compensates through margin improvements and market share gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:34">[01:32:34]</a>.

*   **Aman**: A French computer engineering company that secured a large contract, expected to increase sales by 3-4% and potentially profits by 10-15% by utilizing idle engineers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:10">[01:41:10]</a>.
*   **NKTX (Biopharmaceutical)**: A biopharmaceutical company in its development phase, making it very difficult to analyze due to lack of current income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:58">[01:50:58]</a>.
*   **Cameco (CCJ)**: A uranium company that has performed well due to leverage to the rising price of uranium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.
*   **Lockheed Martin / Northrop Grumman**: Defense companies that manufacture unique, irreplaceable products like fighter jets and ballistic systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:16">[02:09:16]</a>.

*   **Ford Motor Company / General Motors**: Automobile companies are generally considered a "bad business" due to cyclicality, capital intensiveness, high competition, and low-profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>. They trade at low multiples (8-10 times earnings) and grow little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:18">[02:18:18]</a>. They have recovered recently due to pent-up demand and increased disposable income post-confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:53">[02:38:53]</a>.
*   **Ashford Hospitality Trust (AHT)**: A hotel REIT with a problematic management structure where a third-party company, belonging to the founding family, extracts significant money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:20">[02:18:20]</a>. It has high debt (13 times ratio), which poses a risk of capital increases and dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:47">[02:19:47]</a>.
*   **Rent-A-Center (RCII)**: A company that rents goods to customers, often with very high interest rates (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:45">[02:40:45]</a>. While it can generate temporary profits, there is a risk of default on credits given, which can dismantle the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:16">[02:41:16]</a>. It is currently trading at 10-12 times EBITDA and shows good liquidity, with no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:07">[02:44:07]</a>.

### Sector-Specific Insights

*   **Financial Sector**: Generally cheap and has performed well recently, driven by low valuation points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Momentum indices are shifting towards financial stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.
*   [[analysis_of_specific_stocks_in_the_healthcare_and_technology_sectors | Healthcare Sector]]: Despite concerns, companies often have strong competitive advantages, making them difficult to compete against <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>.
*   **Technology Sector**: Large tech companies have been stagnant recently, while smaller, more expensive tech companies have driven Nasdaq's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. The market can be short-term focused, avoiding stocks with perceived poor future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:47">[01:28:47]</a>.
*   **Industrial Services**: A stable and growing sector, exemplified by Up and Group, providing recurrent, non-cyclical services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>.
*   **Packaging Sector**: Considered stable with competitive advantages due to the high cost of transporting finished plastic products, leading to local manufacturing and regional monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>.
*   **Automotive Sector**: A cyclical, capital-intensive business with high competition and low-profit margins, typically trading at low multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:11">[02:18:11]</a>.
*   **Pharmaceutical Sector**: Requires detailed [[analysis_of_key_investments_and_market_conditions | analysis]] of patent declines, which can significantly impact valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:51">[02:08:51]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials**: Companies in this sector have high leverage to the commodity price, meaning a small increase in the raw material price can lead to a much larger increase in company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:09">[02:18:09]</a>.

### General Investment Concepts

*   **Market Dynamics**: Momentum indices rebalance, sometimes excluding technology stocks and including financials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Passive investment and index inclusion can cause forced buying and price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Focus on key metrics like Earnings Per Share (EPS), Free Cash Flow (FCF), Book Value, and EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:19">[01:24:19]</a>. Always consider future potential, not just current figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:05">[01:10:05]</a>. High growth companies without current profits have wider valuation ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:30">[01:44:30]</a>.
*   **Cautionary Notes**: Avoid "bots" and "pyramid schemes" that promise free money or guaranteed high interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a>. Be wary of paying more than 10-15 times sales for a company, as this rarely leads to long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:11">[02:12:11]</a>.
*   **Spin-offs**: These can be interesting investment opportunities, and websites like "Spin-Off Investing" track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **Transparency and Audited Background**: For investment education, seek trainers with audited track records and professional licenses (e.g., CNMV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:02">[02:23:02]</a>.

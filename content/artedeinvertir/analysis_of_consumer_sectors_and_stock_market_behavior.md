Navigating a weak economy and identifying suitable investment opportunities requires understanding how different sectors perform during periods of difficulty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This article focuses on consumer sectors and their behavior in the stock market, particularly highlighting businesses resilient to economic downturns.

## Investing in Crisis-Resistant Sectors

When the economy is weak or facing difficulties, it is best to invest in businesses considered crisis-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Investing in quality companies with recurring income and low debt is always a winning formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. These companies tend to experience smaller declines during market crises and can serve as a source of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

### Sector Performance in Economic Cycles

According to data published by Fidelity, different sectors perform better or worse depending on [[analyzing_economic_cycles_and_market_trends | economic cycles]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

*   **During a Recession**:
    *   **Stable Consumption**: Sectors like food, beverages, and clothing, which cater to basic needs and regular human consumption, perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Utilities**: Companies providing water and electricity consumption also do well because people must continue consuming these services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:24:00">[03:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Healthcare**: The health sector is generally unaffected by recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **During a Recovery**:
    *   **Real Estate**: This sector, which typically declines the most during a recession, tends to perform best during recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
    *   **Financial Sector**: Also affected by economic downturns, the financial sector tends to recover strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

These stable sectors are often preferred by smaller investors due to their lower volatility, which can lead to fewer mistakes and greater calm, even if their market performance lags slightly during upturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

## Case Study: Ahold Delhaize (Supermarket Sector)

Ahold Delhaize is a supermarket company listed in Europe that demonstrates strong crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.

*   **Crisis Performance**: During the 2008-2012 financial crisis, when the overall market fell by 60%, Ahold Delhaize remained largely sideways or experienced only minor drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. This stability allowed investors to use it as a source of liquidity to pursue other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model**:
    *   Predominantly operates in the United States (major market leader on the East Coast in terms of food supermarkets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
    *   Has a large market share in Europe, particularly in Belgium, France, Germany, Greece, and Italy, often holding the number one or two position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.
    *   Benefits from economies of scale, allowing for negotiating power with suppliers and higher profit margins (e.g., private label products account for 45% of sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:39:00">[04:39:00]</a>.
    *   Achieved an average sales growth of 7% and aims for 4% sales growth annually, with earnings per share growing faster due to share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>.
    *   Demonstrates predictable profits, even growing during crisis periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>.
*   **[[valuation_and_performance_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | Valuation and performance of specific stocks and sectors | Valuation]]**: Ahold Delhaize is trading at 12 times earnings, offering a potential shareholder return of 11%, including a 3% dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:00">[04:31:00]</a>. This is significantly lower than competitors like Walmart, which trades at 38 times earnings despite slower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>.

## Case Study: British American Tobacco (Tobacco Sector)

British American Tobacco (BAT) is another stable consumption company that exhibits crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

*   **Crisis Performance**: During the massive global stock market crisis from February 2008 to April 2009, when the market dropped 60%, BAT only fell 13% (10% if dividends are included) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. The company maintained or increased profits during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.
*   **New Categories**: While traditional tobacco consumption has seen declining volumes, price increases compensate for this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. Significant growth comes from new categories:
    *   **Vaping**: Growing at 20% annually until 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
    *   **Oral Tobacco (e.g., nicotine pouches)**: Also growing at 20% annually, offering a more convenient consumption method in various locations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:00">[05:28:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. These new categories, while initially incurring losses due to investment, are now reaching profitability and are expected to significantly boost earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.
*   **Financials and Valuation**: BAT is trading at historic lows of 8 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 16-25 times, and offers an 8% dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. The company aims to generate $50 billion in accumulated free cash flow by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:00">[05:40:00]</a>.
*   **Hidden Asset**: BAT holds a 20% stake in ITC Limited, a major consumer company in India. This stake is valued at approximately $15 billion and contributes to BAT's overall value, making its adjusted valuation even more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:40">[01:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:13">[01:03:13]</a>.

## Other Relevant Consumer/Healthcare Investments

Several other companies within consumer and healthcare sectors demonstrate interesting characteristics for investors.

*   **Wex**: A stable company that recently announced share buybacks, indicating management believes it is undervalued. Historically, such businesses traded at 20 times earnings, but Wex is currently at 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:31">[01:12:31]</a>.
*   **Celsius**: While popular among investors, the energy drink company faces challenges from established giants like Monster and Red Bull, which have significant distribution advantages. This can limit long-term growth and lead to market saturation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:02">[01:13:02]</a>.
*   **PIF (Fragrance Manufacturing)**: A world leader in fragrance manufacturing, producing for many famous brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:42">[01:21:42]</a>. It has a strong competitive advantage and healthy financials (ROE of 20%+), but its IPO occurred at high valuations (25 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:19">[01:23:19]</a>. Caution is advised with IPOs as companies often go public at their peak performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:01">[01:24:01]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Sector**: Companies like United Health Services, Levans, CNA, HCA, and Universal Health have been identified as having crisis-resistant characteristics and currently trading at attractive valuations (e.g., 11-13 times earnings for Levans, CNA, HCA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:33">[01:19:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:26">[01:20:26]</a>. These companies provide essential services, making them less susceptible to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a>.

## General Investment Principles

In volatile market environments, it is crucial to avoid debt for investment purposes, especially when markets are at their highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Maintaining liquidity and having a portion of the portfolio in long-term bonds can be beneficial, as these can be sold to capitalize on opportunities when assets become cheaper during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. As Warren Buffett advises, the number one rule of investment is to not lose money, as avoiding losses ultimately leads to long-term profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:37">[01:33:37]</a>.

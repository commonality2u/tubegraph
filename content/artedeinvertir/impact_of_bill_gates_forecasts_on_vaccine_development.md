[[Bill Gates]] has played a significant role during recent global health crises, both through his forecasts and his investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His movements and statements are closely monitored by investors globally due to his typically accurate vision of the future economy and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Predictions and Warnings
[[Bill Gates]] has been noted for his foresight regarding global health events:
*   He warned that a pandemic similar to recent experiences was highly likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.
*   He also cautioned about a lack of preparedness for such an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   His deep knowledge of the biotechnology sector allowed him to predict which company would be the first to develop a successful vaccine against the initial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.
*   In a CNN interview, [[Bill Gates]] explained the insufficient provision of quality vaccines to poorer countries by richer nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. He warned that variants would return to wealthier countries because the problem wasn't tackled swiftly enough <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This, he stated, would necessitate the development of "second-generation vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.

## [[Bill Gates Investment Strategy and Portfolio Changes]]
Recent public disclosures of [[Bill Gates]]' [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | investment portfolio]] reveal a significant shift, suggesting preparation for a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This represents a radical change in his [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. His investment decisions are considered more indicative of his future economic vision than his public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Focus on Vaccine Stocks
[[Bill Gates]] has concentrated 70% of his investments within the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation portfolio into just three stocks that produce vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This new [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_in_vaccine_stocks | investment strategy]] has led many investors to question if it reflects a negative outlook on the ongoing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

The three primary stocks he has invested in are:

*   **BioNTech (BNTX)**: [[Bill Gates]] began investing in BioNTech in late 2019, just six months before the crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. BioNTech, in collaboration with Pfizer, was the first company to launch an effective vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. The company anticipates a demand of one million doses per year from 2022 onwards, making this a potentially recurrent business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **CureVac (CVAC)**: [[Bill Gates]] invested in CureVac in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. CureVac is a German company collaborating with large pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline on "second-generation vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This investment is considered more speculative as CureVac is in a development phase and not yet profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.
*   **Vir Biotechnology (VIR)**: [[Bill Gates]] invested in Vir Biotechnology in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Vir Biotechnology is developing solutions against multiple variants, including the Delta variant, with high effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. They are also developing an inhaled vaccine solution, potentially making application easier and increasing public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Similar to CureVac, Vir Biotechnology is in the development phase and not yet profitable, making it a speculative investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

These three companies are leading the development of "second-generation vaccines," which are expected to be more sophisticated and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Rationale for [[Bill Gates Focus on Defensive Investments and Sectors | Investment Focus]]
[[Bill Gates]] explained in an interview with CNBC that a return to normalcy hinges not on first-generation vaccines, but on the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. He noted that many companies are working towards this goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. These statements, combined with his recent [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | portfolio movements]], indicate which companies are best positioned to develop these future vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Investing in biotechnology companies during their development phase is risky and volatile, requiring significant knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. However, successful ventures can yield substantial financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>.

Small-cap companies, often overlooked by larger investors, present unique opportunities, especially during periods of market volatility and high inflation. Warren Buffett's recent advice, though general, can be effectively applied to the [[Investment strategy for small caps | small-cap]] market to identify strong [[Identifying good investment opportunities | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Current Market Environment and Small Caps

Warren Buffett has warned that inflation may persist longer than anticipated, and the economy is "quite overheated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. He advises caution against accumulating cash, gold, or Bitcoin, stating that stocks are the safest long-term bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This perspective suggests that equities, including small caps, can better resist inflation and potentially offer excess returns above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

During market downturns, like the S&P 500's nearly 20% correction, [[Analyzing Stock Opportunities | investment opportunities]] arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Historically, significant negativity in the market, such as the levels seen in 2008-2009 or even exceeding 2020 pandemic lows, has often preceded periods of market recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:58">[03:59:58]</a>. The current environment, marked by high inflation expectations, makes finding bargains more likely, especially among the 490 companies (excluding the top 10) in the S&P 500 that are trading below their historical average values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Principles for Identifying Quality Businesses

Warren Buffett advises investors to focus on fundamental principles rather than market timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. His key tips for [[Analyzing company fundamentals for investment | evaluating smallcap stocks]] and other investments include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>:

*   **Buy Good Businesses**: Focus on companies with strong underlying quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>.
*   **Low Capital-Intensive Businesses**: These businesses are better positioned to withstand inflation and crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:35">[01:38:35]</a>.
*   **Predictable Businesses**: Companies with stable operations and clear future prospects are preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:40">[01:38:40]</a>. This can often be verified by examining their behavior during past crises, like 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:43">[01:38:43]</a>.
*   **Good Management**: Assess the company's leadership and their decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:59">[01:38:59]</a>.
*   **Return Money to Shareholders**: Companies that regularly engage in share buybacks or pay dividends are favorable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage (Moat)**: Look for businesses with a "gigantic" competitive moat, which allows them to maintain pricing power and market position without excessive government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:07">[01:39:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:13">[01:39:13]</a>.

### The Problem with "Stock Options"

Warren Buffett has repeatedly warned about the misleading nature of "adjusted profit figures" in many technology companies, which often exclude stock-based compensation (SBC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:58">[02:50:58]</a>. SBC, where employees are paid in company shares instead of cash, dilutes earnings per share (EPS) if the number of shares increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. He argues that SBC is a real expense, and accounting for it can drastically alter valuation multiples (e.g., Amazon's P/FCF jumps from 36x to 150x, Uber's from 20x to 56x when adjusted for SBC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:48">[03:10:48]</a>. This highlights the importance of scrutinizing reported earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:05">[03:07:05]</a>.

## [[Small cap vs large cap companies | Small Caps vs. Large Caps]] Performance

Historically, small companies have demonstrated higher growth in earnings per share compared to large companies. From 2004, small companies (S&P 600) saw their profits multiply by 10x, while large companies (S&P 500) multiplied by 5x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:48">[01:41:48]</a>. Small caps tend to be more sensitive to the economic cycle, falling more significantly during downturns but also recovering faster and performing better in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a>.

In current high-inflation scenarios, small caps and emerging market stocks tend to perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:57">[01:36:57]</a>. Their valuations, especially in regions like the US, Canada, Italy, Germany, France, and the UK, are currently "ridiculous," trading near crisis lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:34">[01:42:34]</a>. The S&P 600, a small-cap index, is trading at approximately 12.4 times earnings, which is a valuation level last seen in 2011, and lower than the historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:16">[01:35:16]</a>. This makes them a "good breeding ground" for future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:27">[01:37:27]</a>.

Several companies mentioned demonstrate the application of these principles:

*   **Dassault Syst√®mes**: A software company specializing in computer-aided design. It operates in an oligopoly, has a high competitive advantage, is not capital-intensive, and offers 95% recurring revenue from licenses. It exhibits consistent growth (double-digit for decades) and expanding margins, making it highly resilient to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:48">[02:28:48]</a>.
*   **Fair Isaac Corporation (FICO)**: Dominates the credit quality database market in the US, holding 74% market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:27">[00:59:27]</a>. This company benefits from a powerful network effect and high switching costs for banks. Its business is stable, predictable, and highly profitable due to its "monopoly" position and ability to raise prices without government regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:26]</a>.
*   **Malibu (MBUU)**: A recreational boat manufacturer benefiting from the aging population in the USA and recent increased interest in outdoor activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. While moderately cyclical, it has shown strong growth and good margins, often returning money to shareholders via buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:12">[02:11:12]</a>.
*   **ASML Holdings (ASML)**: A leader in microchip manufacturing equipment. It possesses unique technology, making it an essential supplier in an oligopolistic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. Despite the cyclical nature of the broader microchip industry, ASML's dominant position allows it to maintain high margins and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>.
*   **FlatexDeGiro (FTG)**: A low-cost broker with an ambitious growth plan. It has seen a significant increase in profits, benefiting from new market entrants, though its sustainability requires careful monitoring of market share and cost advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.
*   **Novo Nordisk (NVO)**: A leading company in diabetes medication manufacturing. It holds an oligopoly position with strong brand recognition and benefits from increasing global demand for its products.

*   **Asbury Automotive Group (ABG)**: A large car dealership chain. Its profitability is driven not just by new car sales, but significantly by parts, repairs, and used car sales, which tend to be countercyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. The company also pursues strategic acquisitions to fuel growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.
*   **Berry Global (BERY)**: A predictable business, confirmed to be robust against inflation. It maintains its expected earnings and has shown consistent profit growth and shareholder returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:37">[01:37:37]</a>.

## [[Analyzing stock market investments | Investment Strategy for Small Caps]]

Success in [[Evaluating smallcap stocks | small-cap investment]] requires a long-term mindset (3-5 years or more) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:34">[00:40:34]</a>. Investors should focus on understanding a company's future earnings, management, and competitive advantages, rather than predicting short-term market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>. Diversification is crucial to mitigate risks inherent in individual stock choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:30">[03:00:30]</a>.

Valuation should involve applying a "reasonable" multiple to future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>. While the discounted cash flow (DCF) method is often taught in academia, large investors typically rely on the multiples method, focusing on historical averages and sector comparisons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:19">[01:10:19]</a>.

*   **Emotional Control**: In bear markets, every sale can appear smart, and every purchase can seem like a mistake due to immediate losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:16">[01:17:16]</a>. However, focusing on the long-term value offered by good prices is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.
*   **Geographic Focus**: When investing, consider stable economies and currencies, primarily in the United States, Canada, the United Kingdom, and Western Europe (France, Germany, Italy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: Understanding fundamental business models, competitive dynamics, and financial analysis is essential for identifying true opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:53">[01:50:53]</a>.

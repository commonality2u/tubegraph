The 2030 Agenda is presented as a major economic and social reform with significant implications for savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This new plan, which is already underway, has the support of influential figures such as [[impact_of_bill_gates_predictions_on_global_economics | Bill Gates]], Bill Clinton, the majority of state presidents, and the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Its overarching motto is "you will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Origins and Evolution

The 2030 Agenda has mutated under various names, including "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It originated from the core of the Davos Forum (World Economic Forum), which convenes powerful individuals like [[impact_of_bill_gates_predictions_on_global_economics | Bill Gates]], [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions_and_their_implications | Ray Dalio]], and global businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This forum debates economic policies that are subsequently implemented at a local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Designed in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, the agenda is now entering its "most critical phase" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Many experts believe its policies could be causing the current [[economic_indicators_and_their_implications | crisis]] and high levels of [[interest_rate_hikes_and_economic_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

The agenda is symbolized by a pin with 17 colored sections, each representing an objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, including collaboration among nations, reducing [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | inequality]], and alleviating poverty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Klaus Schwab, head of the Davos Forum, leads efforts to modify the new [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | economic and social reality]] through these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. Ida Auken, a Danish politician, summarized the economic vision: "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

## Economic Predictions for 2030

The World Economic Forum's promotional video, "Eight predictions for the world in the year 2030," highlights several concerning forecasts:

*   **You will own nothing and you will be happy** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>: This prediction suggests a shift where individuals will rent rather than own necessities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This change is already evident:
    *   Most cars are financed or rented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, with 70% of vehicles sold in the US being financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.
    *   Many rent iPhones from Apple rather than owning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
    *   Homes are often mortgaged or rented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
    *   Movies are accessed via monthly subscriptions (e.g., Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.
    *   Companies like BMW are now offering features like heated seats or adaptive headlights via monthly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Such initiatives, if supported by political and economic powers, could become the new standard, forcing consumers to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Historically, these actions would be considered monopolistic abuses of the consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, but they are now approved and encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

*   **The United States will no longer be the world's leading power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>: This prediction suggests a shift in the global power balance, with a decline in the US due to debt accumulation and rising political populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The dollar's market share has already dropped from 70% to 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>, being replaced by other currencies, especially the [[rising_economic_influence_of_china and its impact | Chinese yuan]] and other Asian currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions_and_their_implications | Ray Dalio]] summarized this in his book, "The New World Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Corporate Beneficiaries of the New Economic Model

This shift from ownership to subscription/rental models is proving "tremendously beneficial" for a small number of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

*   **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Founded by [[impact_of_bill_gates_predictions_on_global_economics | Bill Gates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, Microsoft's stock price multiplied more than ten times after 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. This surge coincides with its strategic shift from selling perpetual software licenses (e.g., Office for $300) to a monthly rental model (e.g., $100 annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. While initially seeming cheaper, this model ensures constant cash flow and allows for more aggressive price increases over time, extracting significantly more revenue from clients over their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Despite being fined for monopolistic practices 20 years ago, such behavior is now approved due to its alignment with the 2030 Agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

*   **Adobe (ADBE)**: Similar to Microsoft, Adobe's stock has multiplied over 12 times since changing its economic model in 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Adobe offers indispensable products like Photoshop and PDF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. The shift from a $1,000 one-time license to a $50 monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a> generates more lucrative long-term revenue and consistent cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This change dramatically increased its earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

*   **Automotive and Other Sectors**: Financial divisions of car companies like Volkswagen and Renault are often more profitable than manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The technology sector, in particular, is rife with companies benefiting from this shift, often holding "almost monopolistic" positions and flourishing profits, without facing investigations for consumer abuse as they align with the objectives of the powerful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

## Environmental Policies and Economic Impact

Predictions 5 and 6 of the World Economic Forum's agenda focus on protecting the environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. However, the proposed method is "totally radical," aiming to eliminate fossil fuels without a clear, strategic energy transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Measures like price limits on gas or oil are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

This battle against fossil fuels, coinciding with the 2030 Agenda's implementation, is seen as a major cause of the current [[global_debt_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | inflation crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The lack of planning in the energy transition has led to high energy prices due to reduced investment in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>. Investment in oil exploitation and production has fallen by 60% since policies began to change, from $600 billion to less than $200 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. High [[economic_indicators_and_their_implications | inflation]] disproportionately affects the average class and historically causes high levels of [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | poverty and social inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities

Despite the broader economic challenges, some sectors and companies are benefiting from these shifts:

*   **Oil and Gas Companies**: These companies have been star investments in 2022, as high energy prices have led to significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
*   **Occidental Oil (OXY)**: Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, aggressively invested over $10 billion in Occidental Oil months before prices soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Occidental Oil is a leading company in oil extraction and processing in regions like the Permian Basin and the Gulf of Mexico, boasting low extraction costs and large reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. It currently trades at six times earnings, below its historical average, and offers significant shareholder returns through dividends and buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

Many companies benefiting from these rental or subscription models have seen their valuations drop in the first half of the year due to market fear, potentially presenting new investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

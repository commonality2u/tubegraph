The [[impact_of_the_2030_agenda_on_investment_strategies|2030 Agenda]] is described as potentially the biggest economic and social reform in decades, poised to equally affect everyone regardless of their investment habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. It is expected to have serious implications for personal savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The agenda is already underway, with its first consequences beginning to be experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Origins and Support

The [[impact_of_the_2030_agenda_on_investment_strategies|2030 Agenda]] has mutated under various names, including "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. It originated from the Davos Forum (also known as the World Economic Forum), which convenes powerful global figures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This forum debates economic policies that are later implemented locally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Key supporters of the agenda include:
*   Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   Bill Clinton <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>
*   The majority of presidents of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>
*   The United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>
*   [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy|Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   Some of the most powerful businessmen globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>

The agenda was designed in 2015, and its most critical phase is now being entered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. Many experts and economists suggest that its policies could be a cause of the current [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy|economic crisis]] characterized by high levels of [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy|inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Core Ideology and Slogans

The motto of this global campaign is "you will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. This sentiment is echoed in statements by politicians like Ida Auken of Denmark, who summarized the economic part of the new global agenda with: "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

The World Economic Forum has published a promotional video titled "Eight Predictions for the World in the Year 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The first prediction states: "You will own nothing and you will be happy. You will be able to rent anything you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Economic Implications and Predictions

The [[impact_of_the_2030_agenda_on_investment_strategies|2030 Agenda]] aims to modify the way people invest and save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Shift from Ownership to Rental Model
A significant economic change is the shift from owning things to renting them or paying for them long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This change is proving beneficial for a small number of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Examples include:
*   Cars: Many people rent or finance cars with monthly fees instead of outright ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. In the US, 70% of vehicles sold are financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   Technology: iPhones are often rented from Apple for a monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   Housing: Most people have mortgages or pay monthly rent for their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Entertainment: Movies are accessed via monthly subscriptions like Netflix, rather than purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

Companies are increasingly offering rental products. For instance, BMW announced monthly fees for features like heated seats ($15/month), artificial sports sounds ($99/month), and adaptive headlights ($10/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Such initiatives, when encouraged by political and economic powers, could become the new standard, forcing consumers to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Historically, these actions would be considered monopolistic abuse of consumers, but they are now aligned with the [[the_great_economic_reset_and_its_implications|Great Economic Reset]] and [[impact_of_the_2030_agenda_on_investment_strategies|global objectives]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

Companies like Microsoft and Adobe have successfully adopted this subscription-based model:
*   **Microsoft (MSFT)**: From 2013, Microsoft shifted from selling perpetual licenses to charging monthly rents for products like Microsoft Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. This change transformed the company from a "boring" stock to one that multiplied its shares by more than ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. While an initial license might cost $300, a monthly fee of $100 annually, paid for life, extracts far more money over time (e.g., $3,000-$7,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **Adobe (ADBE)**: Similarly, Adobe, after changing its economic model in 2012, has seen its stock multiply by over 12 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. It now charges a small monthly license fee ($50) for products like Adobe PDF and Photoshop, which is more lucrative in the long run than a one-time license fee ($1,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>. This has led to a significant increase in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

This model, coupled with almost monopolistic competitive positions, allows profits to flourish, and these practices are not investigated for consumer abuse because they are approved by political powers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.

### Global Power Shifts
Prediction number 2 from the World Economic Forum states that "The United States will no longer be the world's leading power and a small number of countries will replace them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. This risk has been highlighted by influential figures like [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy|Ray Dalio]] in his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. In this scenario, the dollar would cease to be the most important currency, and the US would decline due to accumulated debt and political populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Data from the International Monetary Fund shows the dollar's market share has dropped from 70% to 60%, being replaced by other currencies, particularly the Chinese yuan and other Asian currencies where growth is concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Energy Transition and [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy|Inflation]]
Predictions number 5 and 6 of the [[impact_of_the_2030_agenda_on_investment_strategies|2030 Agenda]] aim to protect the environment, but the proposed method is "totally radical" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. It proposes completely eliminating fossil fuels without a clear, strategic energy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, and even suggests establishing price limits on gas or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

This approach is believed to be a major cause of the current global [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy|inflation crisis]], driven by high prices of fossil fuels like oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. High [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy|inflation]] disproportionately affects the average class and has historically led to increased poverty and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

Since the implementation of the [[impact_of_the_2030_agenda_on_investment_strategies|2030 Agenda]], there has been a "battle against fossil fuels" with an unplanned energy transition, leading to high energy prices due to lack of investment in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Investment in oil exploitation and production has fallen by 60% from $600 billion annually to less than $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

Despite the market collapse in 2022, oil and gas companies have been a "star investment" due to high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. Warren Buffett notably began aggressively investing in Occidental Oil (OXY) months before oil prices soared, investing over $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>. This company, a leader in oil extraction and processing in regions like the Permian Basin and Gulf of Mexico, trades at six times earnings, below its historical average of ten times earnings, and returns profits to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

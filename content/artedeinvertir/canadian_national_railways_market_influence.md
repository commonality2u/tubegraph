Canadian National Railway (CNI) holds a significant position in Bill Gates' investment portfolio, representing 15.7% of his holdings, making it his third-largest concentration. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>

## Business Overview and Market Dominance
Canadian National Railway is recognized as one of the dominant rail transport companies in Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a> It recently merged with Kansas City Southern, a U.S. company, to create a North American axis, strengthening its presence across the southern area of Canada and connecting to the Texas/Gulf of Mexico region for raw material transportation and export. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>

Rail transport remains a cost-effective method for shipping very heavy merchandise that does not require next-day delivery by air or road, offering a very low cost for large volumes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a> This mode of transport is expected to continue existing for such applications. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:50">[00:27:50]</a>

The company primarily transports raw materials such as coal, iron ore, copper, and aluminum, as well as oil in adapted wagons, and some industrial merchandise. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a> They also transport grains, fertilizers, forestry materials, and intermodal containers (standardized containers loadable on both trains and ships). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:23">[00:29:23]</a>

## Market Influence and Competitive Advantages
The railway sector has become highly concentrated, with practically three or four listed companies controlling almost all the business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a> This consolidation allows them to set prices and exert a strong dominant force in the market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>

Unlike other industries, these businesses are considered non-cyclical because the volume of transportation is consistently needed due to human consumption and predictable demand for raw materials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:16">[00:28:16]</a>

Canadian National Railway's expansion to connect with the strategic Gulf of Mexico port terminals is a significant competitive advantage, enabling ship exports to the rest of the world. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:46">[00:28:46]</a> The difficulty in building parallel railway lines or obtaining licenses creates local monopolies, a characteristic highly favored by investors like [[warren_buffett_investment_strategies|Warren Buffett]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:15">[00:29:15]</a>

Canadian National Railway holds a 14% market share, with other major players including Union Pacific (also listed) and BNSF (privately owned by [[warren_buffett_investment_strategies|Warren Buffett]]). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a> The success of all companies within this sector suggests a very good underlying structure for profitability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>

## Financial Performance and Outlook
The company's stock has shown impressive growth, multiplying almost 100 times in 25 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a> It exhibits very low volatility and has remained predictable, with corrections not being very large even during crises like 2008. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:14">[00:30:14]</a>

Canadian National Railway consistently pays a solid and growing dividend, a common characteristic among Bill Gates' investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a> The company also actively engages in share buybacks, setting a record year in 2022. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a> This strategy increases earnings per share and shareholder ownership. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>

Canadian National Railway has a plan to reach higher earnings per share in the next three years, expecting annual profit growth between 10% and 15%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a> While sales saw a slight drop in 2023 due to lower raw material prices and increased operating costs, the company is forecast to recover and achieve record profits in the coming years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:12">[00:34:12]</a>

## Valuation
The company's valuation stands at 20 times earnings, which aligns with its historical average over the last five years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a> During times of crisis or fear, the valuation has historically reached a floor around 16 times earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a> Bill Gates tends not to overpay for stocks, preferring companies with stable growth and predictable returns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:13">[00:35:13]</a>

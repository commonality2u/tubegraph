**Ray Dalio**, known as the manager of the world's largest investment fund, has issued a new warning about the future economic landscape, stating that the future "could change significantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His recent portfolio adjustments show him selling shares and adopting a "much more defensive" investment strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

Dalio is renowned for successfully navigating numerous market crises over the past 20 to 30 years, often experiencing very low losses during downturns and good returns during market upswings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. He gained significant recognition for [[economic_disaster_warning_by_ray_dalio | predicting the financial crisis in 2008]], even warning the U.S. government, though they did not heed his advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>. This history leads the market to pay close attention to his statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>.

## Key Economic Concerns

Dalio's warnings stem from several interconnected issues:

*   **Political Polarization in the U.S.**
    He points to a "tremendous political polarization" between Republicans and Democrats in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>, even mentioning the "risk of civil war" as a somewhat excessive, but notable, concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. This internal struggle is something to monitor for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Shift in Global Power**
    He highlights a rotation of global power from the United States to China, which could lead to future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This is part of his concept of a [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | new world order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. In this new order, he has suggested the dollar "could cease to be the world reserve" currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Policy and Inflation**
    Dalio warns that central banks, including the Fed, are changing their policies from "easy money" and low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. He believes that policies of printing money and giving it to people will have "serious consequences in the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
    *   **[[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | High Inflation]] and Difficult Financial Conditions** Investors must adapt to a future where central banks no longer provide "free money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Instead, there will be periods of "high inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a> and "much more difficult financial conditions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Interest Rate Hikes** An emergency Fed meeting occurred, and one Fed member indicated interest rates in the U.S. could reach 1% by July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This would imply four rate hikes in upcoming Fed meetings, a scenario the market hadn't fully priced in, leading to recent volatility and drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. Inflation data has shown the highest levels in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.
*   **Speculation in Crypto and Tech Stocks**
    Dalio has also commented on the "madness" seen in the crypto world and certain technological stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

## Market Outlook

In a video on February 10th, Dalio discussed how investors need to prepare for "much lower" rates of return in the markets than in the past, potentially 3% to 4% compared to historical rates of 8% to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:00">[05:02:00]</a>. He also suggested these lower returns would come with a "much higher level of risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. He explicitly warned that the world "could change in a quite alarming way in the next five years" due to new financial conditions, the new world order, and internal U.S. struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

Dalio's right-hand man, James, explained that the "Fed's put" (the Federal Reserve's intervention to support the market) is unlikely to occur until the S&P 500 experiences falls of 15% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. This suggests that the Fed may view further market corrections as healthy to adjust overvaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>. The S&P 500 has corrected about 9% from its maximum, while the Nasdaq and small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 have corrected closer to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## Dalio's Portfolio Adjustments

Reflecting his [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | economic predictions]], Dalio has made significant changes to his portfolio:
*   He has sold approximately 90 shares entirely and reduced his weighting in nearly 300 other shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   **Sales:** He sold almost all of his shares in emerging countries' ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. Historically, emerging market and technology shares tend to correct more during volatility, as they are considered riskier assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** His purchases, which are proportionally smaller than his sales, have been in "defensive shares" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. These include companies like Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which are expected to perform better if the market corrects significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. While they rise slower in a bull market, they tend to fall much less in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>. This demonstrates a clear shift to a "very defensive" portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

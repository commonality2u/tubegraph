Michael Burry, known for his prediction of the 2007-2008 financial crisis, has made a significant bearish investment in [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. This bet, valued at approximately $500 million, constitutes a substantial 40% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Bearish Bet on Tesla

Burry's investment strategy often involves complementing his value stock approach with macroeconomic bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. His latest large bet against [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] is structured through put options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>.

### Rationale for the Bet
Michael Burry previously explained in tweets that the entire automobile industry's earnings were around $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. He argued that even if [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] achieved 10% to 20% of these profits, it would not justify a valuation exceeding $20 or $30 trillion (which he indicated was approximately 95% less than its current capitalization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. He also anticipates that other manufacturers will develop autonomous car software, challenging [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]]'s upside from software licensing and autonomous driving technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

### Investment Structure
The bearish position on [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] is implemented using put options, specifically drawing attention to January 2023 contracts with a strike price around $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>
> [!INFO] Option Strategy
> Put options allow an investor to profit if the underlying asset's price falls, with the potential for substantial gains while limiting the maximum loss to the premium paid for the options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. This creates an "asymmetrical" investment where one can lose a small amount but win a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:00">[06:32:00]</a>.

At the time of analysis, [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] was trading around $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. If the stock were to fall to $150, for example, a $400 put option could yield $250 per share. Given that option contracts typically represent 100 shares, and a $400 put might cost around $65, this represents a potential multiplication of the investment by four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

Burry's use of options is considered an "intelligent way" to operate, as it limits his potential losses if the stock were to continue rising (as it has for other short-sellers who lost significantly when the stock multiplied) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.

## Market Context and Challenges for Tesla
The market's enthusiasm for high-growth technology stocks, including [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]], has been a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
Recent data indicated poor reception of orders for [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] in China, a market considered crucial for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>
> [!WARNING] Speculative Behavior
> The current market environment exhibits behaviors seen in past [[analysis_of_the_current_stock_market_bubble | bubbles]], with significant speculation in stocks that lack current profits or have high valuations, which are very sensitive to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>. Investors should understand the risks involved in these "speculative stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

While many investors have attempted to short [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] in the past and suffered significant losses as the stock rose dramatically, Burry's option-based approach aims to mitigate this unlimited downside risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

Michael Burry, the renowned investor featured in the movie *The Big Short*, has issued his latest warning, indicating that the current crisis has "only just begun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He has even specified a level he believes the stock market could reach before the crisis potentially ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Credibility and Past Forecasts

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry]] gained fame for accurately predicting the dot-com bubble crisis, which he views as similar to the current situation, earning him respect for his current opinions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a>. He also successfully predicted and profited from the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. Furthermore, he took advantage of the market downturn in 2020 during the virus confinement, buying cheap shares, including GameStop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:04">[01:56:04]</a>. Since retiring to manage only his own money, his returns have exceeded 20% annually over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.

He reactivated his Twitter account after a suspension by the SEC due to concerns about market manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:04">[02:29:04]</a>. In a tweet, he pointed out that his previous warnings about inflation, rising rates, and bubbles in areas like high-growth stocks, cloud computing, renewable energy, and cryptocurrencies, have largely been fulfilled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:04">[02:48:04]</a>. He noted that despite being called a "doomsayer" then, he is "warning them" now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:04">[03:04:04]</a>.

## Current Market Outlook: The Bear Market Warning

[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Michael Burry]] characterizes the current market as a typical bear market, frequently experiencing "bear market rallies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:04">[03:12:04]</a>. A bear market rally occurs when the stock market temporarily bounces back during a downturn before continuing its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:04">[03:21:04]</a>. Many investors tend to buy during these rebounds, mistakenly believing the crisis is over and that losses will be recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:04">[03:39:04]</a>.

He highlights that the 2020 crisis was atypical, with a V-shaped recovery that fostered a belief among investors to "buy the dip" immediately after falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:04">[03:53:04]</a>. However, he emphasizes that this is not typical for bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:04">[04:32:04]</a>. In the crises of 2000 and 1929, there were ten false market recovery attempts (bear market rallies) exceeding 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:04">[04:32:04]</a>. The 2008 crisis also saw this pattern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:04">[04:34:04]</a>. During the dot-com bubble collapse, there were cycles of two months of decline followed by one month of rise, leading many to exhaust liquidity and incur debt, only to see the Nasdaq fall an additional 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:04">[04:54:04]</a>.

These rallies are often fueled by investor psychology, where people believe the worst is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:04">[05:37:04]</a>. However, true market bottoms are characterized by large capital outflows, desperation, an economic recession, and central banks facilitating economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:04">[05:47:04]</a>. Currently, central bankers are making economic conditions difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:04">[06:02:04]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys prediction of a stock market crisis | Michael Burry's Specific Market Predictions]]

[[Michael Burrys prediction of a stock market crisis | Michael Burry]] has projected how much the stock market could fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:04">[06:14:04]</a>. He often uses technical analysis, which he says accounts for 5% of his investment style, combined with valuation ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:04">[07:39:04]</a>.

Based on historical paradigms and his calculations, [[Michael Burrys prediction on the end of the current crisis | Michael Burry]] estimates that bear markets typically end 13-17% below the previous crisis's minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:04">[08:11:04]</a>. He believes the current market, despite recent interruptions, is still in a bull market that is now in a decline phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:04">[08:23:04]</a>.

He predicts the S&P 500 could bottom out at a Price-to-Earnings (PER) ratio of 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:04">[08:35:04]</a>. This PER 9 valuation coincides with the S&P 500's bottom in 2009 and would also be 15% below the minimum of the 2020 virus-induced market low, and 10% below a previous maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:04">[08:45:04]</a>.

This implies the S&P 500 could reach 1,860 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:04">[09:06:04]</a>, representing an additional 50% drop from current levels, largely based on valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:04">[09:12:04]</a>. Currently, the S&P 500 averages around $200 per share in earnings and trades at approximately 3,900 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:04">[09:25:04]</a>. In a recession, earnings typically fall by 20-30%, potentially to $150-$160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:04">[09:37:04]</a>. Applying a multiple of 15-16 times earnings to this reduced profit would result in an S&P 500 valuation of around 2,400 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:04">[09:44:04]</a>.

[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] believes that market volatility, characterized by large daily increases and decreases (e.g., 3% up one day, 3% down the next), is related to market peaks and valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:04">[10:52:04]</a>. High volatility during a rise is often associated with peaks, while high volatility during a fall can signal a market bottom as capital flows from fearful sellers balance with new inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:09:04">[11:09:04]</a>.

## Reasons for [[Michael Burrys Economic Predictions | Burry's Economic Predictions]]

*   **Bear Market Rallies**: The current market is characterized by false rallies that trap investors, similar to past major crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:04">[03:16:04]</a>.
*   **FED Policies**: The Federal Reserve's aggressive tightening and difficult economic conditions could lead to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:04">[12:38:04]</a>. There are rumors the FED might welcome a recession to cool inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:04">[13:08:04]</a>.
*   **Overvaluation**: Jim Chanos notes that past bubbles had identifiable overvalued stocks with market caps of $2-5 billion, but current obscene levels include companies with $30-40 billion market caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:04">[13:59:04]</a>. Cryptocurrencies, for example, reached a total market capitalization of $1.5 trillion, similar to the size of the 2000 dot-com bubble ($2 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:04">[14:41:04]</a>.
*   **Declining Profits & Funding Issues**: Many high-growth, non-profitable companies are seeing compressed margins and investors are no longer providing more money, nor are banks willing to finance their losses, leading to a "dead end" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:04">[15:13:04]</a>. This "tsunami" in the Nasdaq is dragging down other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:04">[15:32:04]</a>.
*   **10-Year Bond Yield**: [[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Warren Buffett]] referred to the 10-year bond as the "force of gravity" in finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:04">[29:29:04]</a>. When the bond yield was at 1%, a PER of 90-100 times earnings was justified for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:45:04">[29:45:04]</a>. With the bond yield now at 3%, this is equivalent to a PER of 33, making stocks with higher PERs seem expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:04">[30:17:04]</a>. Rising bond yields pull down stock valuations, disproportionately affecting more expensive, higher-risk, or non-profitable stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:04">[30:51:04]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys recent stock sale and market outlook | Michael Burry's Portfolio Adjustments]]

[[Michael Burrys recent stock sale and market outlook | Michael Burry]] is primarily creating liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:04">[16:16:04]</a>. In Q3 2020, his declared portfolio value with the SEC was $300 million, peaking at $1.8 billion invested through derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:04">[16:40:04]</a>. However, in his latest report, he has dismantled almost everything, investing only $75 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:04">[17:07:04]</a>. This suggests he holds very few long shares and may have taken short positions against the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:04">[17:19:04]</a>.

His remaining portfolio is concentrated in highly defensive shares, with the top three stocks accounting for almost 75% of his limited holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:45:04">[17:45:04]</a>.

### Key Stock Purchases

*   **Bristol Myers (BMS)**: A pharmaceutical company, seen as highly resistant to crises and less affected by inflation because healthcare products are essential and prices can be increased through contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:50">[42:50]</a>. It has a robust shareholder treatment program, increasing dividends and buying back shares, reflecting a valuation below its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19">[43:19]</a>. Despite some declining products due to patent expiry, new products are increasing sales more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53">[43:53]</a>. Bristol Myers generates $16 billion in cash flow annually, with $15 billion available for distribution after reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:23">[45:23]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics**: A defense company with aerospace (Gulfstream private jets), maritime defense, combat systems (tanks), and technology divisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07">[48:07]</a>. While it has seen modest growth in billing over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:26">[49:26]</a>, its shares have not dropped, doubling since 2020 lows, possibly due to increased defense spending expectations given geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:49">[49:49]</a>. It currently trades at a high valuation range (19 times earnings), above its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:39">[50:39]</a>.

## Other Investor Perspectives

*   **George Soros**: Believes that in bear markets, most money is lost by those who buy on the decline, increasing their positions during false rallies with the illusion that hyper-overvalued stocks will recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:04">[06:20:04]</a>.
*   [[Bill Gates predictions on economic threats | Jim Chanos]]: Notes that the current situation differs from past bubbles because market capitalizations of bubbled stocks have reached "obscene levels" of $30-40 billion, compared to $2-5 billion previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:04">[13:59:04]</a>. He describes the current market as a "tsunami" and a "minefield" for many stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:04">[15:04:04]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and advice for stock market success | Investment Strategies and Advice]]

The speaker emphasizes that investors will inevitably face a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:21:04">[20:21:04]</a>. The attitude taken during these key moments will determine an investor's long-term career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:37:04">[20:37:04]</a>. The stock market is an excellent wealth-generating mechanism over 30-50 years, as demonstrated by [[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:04">[20:48:04]</a>. Many people quit after losing money in a bubble, but taking control, learning, and facing bear markets bravely can change one's mentality and make them "invincible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:54:04">[21:54:04]</a>.

Key advice includes:
*   **Education and Learning**: Understand how to analyze businesses, identify risks, and value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:04">[22:55:04]</a>.
*   **Avoid Emotional Decisions**: Often, the correct action in the market is the opposite of what one's emotions suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:04">[23:03:04]</a>. Selling everything during a decline out of fear is often a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:16:04">[23:16:04]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective**: Focus on how businesses will perform in five years, rather than short-term volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:20">[42:20]</a>. Volatility is normal, and temporary losses are part of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:21">[30:21]</a>.
*   **Understand Valuation**: Look for companies with reasonable valuations, good growth prospects, and strong management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:57:04">[37:57:04]</a>.
*   **Beware of "Revolutionary" Companies**: Many companies promoted as revolutionary, especially in fintech or AI without a solid profit model, can be dangerous investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:04">[01:07:04]</a>.
*   **Protect Against Inflation**: Investing in productive assets, as [[Michael Burrys investment strategies against inflation | Warren Buffett]] advises, is the only way to protect purchasing power against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:25">[01:23:25]</a>. Holding cash leads to a "silent robbery" of purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>.
*   **Recognize Opportunities**: Bear markets (like the current one, with Nasdaq down ~25% and Russell 2000 ~27% from highs) present opportunities that occur every 5-10 years to acquire quality assets at lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:04:04">[24:04:04]</a>.
*   **Permanent vs. Temporary Loss**: The real risk in the stock market is permanent loss, not temporary declines due to market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:27]</a>.

In conclusion, the market is in a complex season where the FED must raise rates to control inflation, which may lead to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:33">[01:32:33]</a>. However, even if interest rates rise significantly, solid companies with low debt, stable business models, and attractive valuations will become cheap, attracting capital and eventually ending the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:12">[01:35:12]</a>.

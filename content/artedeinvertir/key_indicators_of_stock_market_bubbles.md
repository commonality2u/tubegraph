Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest hedge fund manager with over $100 trillion in assets under management, has identified six key indicators that historically warn of potential problems in the market, including a [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market bubble]] and potential crisis, as seen in the 1920s leading to the 1929 crash, and the dot-com bubble leading to the 2007 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Dalio's knowledge of the market is extensive, demonstrated by his minimal losses during the 2008 crisis, when much of the market lost over 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Six Advanced Indicators

Dalio uses these six indicators to monitor [[economic_indicators_and_their_impact_on_stock_markets | economic situations]] and the [[analysis_of_the_stock_market_environment | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### 1. General Bullish Sentiment

This indicator assesses whether there is a widespread belief that the [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stock market]] will continue to rise, making it an excellent investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. The danger lies in the lack of new capital if everyone has already invested, as short-to-medium term market rises are driven by capital flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Historically, periods of pessimism (e.g., 2020, 2022) have coincided with the best market recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

Current observations show:
*   Inflows to American equity funds are over $150 billion in a single month, surpassing the 2021 bubble levels of meme stocks and disruptive tech stocks which saw $70 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.
*   BlackRock published an article suggesting the global economy will no longer experience boom-and-bust cycles, which is reminiscent of similar claims made just before the 1929 Crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   Optimism is at its highest, with many participants not expecting a common 10% market correction in the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.

### 2. New Buyers (Stock Market Tourists)

This indicator looks for the entry of "stock market tourists"â€”individuals who invest without knowledge, simply because they see others making money in a rising market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. This signals exhaustion, as there is little new capital to inject into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. "Smart Money," or market insiders (company directors with high knowledge of company performance), typically do the opposite of the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Historical and current observations:
*   Insider purchases spiked during market downturns like the 2020 COVID correction, indicating opportunities when stock prices were cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>.
*   Currently, insiders are selling shares at their highest levels in the last 10 years, while the general public's money inflows are at record highs across all financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   The percentage of investors believing the market will continue to rise is at an all-time high in the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   American investors have almost 60% of their portfolios allocated to stocks, an all-time high, compared to around 30% during financial crises when stocks were cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

### 3. Unrealistic Future Conditions/Corporate Profit Expectations

This indicator questions whether stock prices discount unrealistic future conditions, particularly regarding corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>. While corporate profits typically drive [[company_earnings_and_stock_market_trends | stock market]] movements, unrealistic expectations can lead to problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

Current observations:
*   Analysts' estimates for S&P 500 profit growth over the next five years are nearly at historical highs, at 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   Historically, S&P 500 profits have very rarely grown at a rate greater than 11%, with the average annual growth between 1980 and 2020 being 5.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   Expectations often become unrealistic after significant market rises, as seen before the dot-com bubble or pre-COVID in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

### 4. High Valuations

This indicator examines whether valuations are high according to traditional metrics that have been effective for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

Current observations:
*   The S&P 500's P/E ratio of 25 implies a profitability of 4%, which is lower than the profitability of short-term bills (4-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. Historically, market corrections tend to occur when short-term bills offer higher returns than the [[analysis_of_the_current_stock_market_bubble | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   Valuing by cash flow, traditional metrics suggest an annual profitability of only 2%, contradicting investor expectations of double-digit returns (10-18%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   The current S&P 500 valuation is around 17 times Cash Flow (or almost 30 times Free Cash Flow), implying an expected 10-year return of only 10% based on historical data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:20">[00:18:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:44">[00:18:44]</a>.
*   The "Magnificent Seven" and other mega-cap stocks are trading at an average of 45 times earnings, with some like Tesla at 189x and Amazon/Apple at 50x and 30x respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. These historically traded at 20-25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.
*   While the S&P 500's largest and most famous companies peaked at 24 times earnings (before a 40% fall), they are currently at 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   Conversely, small and medium-sized companies, less famous and less followed, are valued around or below their historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:21:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:49">[00:22:49]</a>.

### 5. Financing Purchases with Debt

This indicator checks whether market purchases are being financed excessively with debt, which can deepen corrections due to liquidation effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>.

Current observations:
*   Margin debt levels are currently lower than in 2021 (when meme stocks and cryptocurrencies surged) and are comparable to 2017 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:10">[00:24:10]</a>.
*   This indicator does *not* suggest a problem, as people are generally investing money they possess, rather than borrowed funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

### 6. High Future Commitments

This indicator measures high future commitments, such as in derivatives or futures purchases, using Dalio's "Babel Couch" indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>.

Current observations:
*   Currently, the "Babel Couch" indicator is at 50%, which is the historical average of the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.
*   This is significantly lower than levels of 80% or 100% seen during the 1929 and 1990s bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.
*   This indicator does *not* suggest significant problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>.

## Conclusion on Indicators

Of the six indicators, four of the most important ones suggest caution, while two (financing with debt and high future commitments) do not indicate problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>. This suggests a need for investors to be aware of existing market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:23">[00:25:23]</a>.

## Investment Advice in the Current Environment

Given the current market conditions, Dalio and other major investors advise:
*   **Monitor valuations:** Even if the overall index is expensive, building a solid portfolio is possible by finding lesser-known companies with attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>.
*   **Avoid using debt:** Be cautious with leveraged investing, especially when the market is at its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:49">[00:25:49]</a>.
*   **Invest in stable, predictable businesses:** Focus on companies with good management that offer good returns and allow for peaceful sleep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.
*   **Seek opportunities outside the top stocks:** There are many valuable opportunities beyond the top 10 or 50 most well-known stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:03">[00:26:03]</a>.

### Examples of Opportunities

The market currently exhibits a divergence where new participants are attracted to short-term gains from highly rising, often expensive, stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. However, more solid, common-sense investment strategies focusing on good, not-too-expensive stocks have underperformed recently due to this euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.

Examples of companies that illustrate the opportunities outside the most expensive market segments include:

*   **Uber:** Despite being a large tech company, it has corrected recently and is growing at nearly 20% annually with good competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:24">[00:26:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. Its valuation is significantly lower than its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Capgemini:** A European IT services company that has corrected due to European election instability and trade tariff fears, despite solid earnings growth and being a potential beneficiary of artificial intelligence implementation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:45">[00:29:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:37">[00:30:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:10">[00:31:10]</a>. It is trading well below its historical average valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>.
*   **Jackson Financial:** A US company in variable annuities, offering predictable, recurring revenue from long-term pension planning, and trading at a significant discount to its sector average due to complex accounting and a "boring" sector perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:30">[00:42:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:05">[00:48:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:59">[00:49:59]</a>.
*   **Dollar General:** A discount company that experienced recent difficulties but is stabilizing, with growth estimates affirming a recovery and potential for margin improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:06">[00:51:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:32">[00:51:32]</a>.
*   **Teleperformance:** Despite analyst criticism, this company makes strategic acquisitions that generate significant long-term value, even in a market fearful of AI's impact on its services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:45">[00:52:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:13">[00:53:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:34]</a>.
*   **Google (Alphabet):** Considered by some as the least expensive among the "Magnificent Seven," with strong growth, hidden assets (like Waymo and Android), and a critical position in AI development due to its vast data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:36">[00:59:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.
*   **Tinexta:** A small Italian company in consulting services that has seen its valuation collapse due to temporary political uncertainty in Europe, despite a high-predictability growth trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:29">[01:00:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:19]</a>.
*   **Volkswagen / Mercedes:** European automotive companies whose stocks have plummeted due to market negativity and higher interest rates impacting car sales, but their fundamental performance doesn't show a collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:56">[01:03:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:49">[01:04:49]</a>.

These examples highlight opportunities in the market when focusing on strong businesses with reasonable valuations, rather than following the euphoric segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:07">[01:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:42">[01:03:42]</a>. Investors should cultivate independent thought and avoid being "stock market tourists" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:19">[01:06:19]</a>.

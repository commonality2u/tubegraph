The world faces significant economic risks from rising food and energy prices, which contribute to global [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] and have historical precedents for causing societal unrest [00:10:52].

## Food Crisis
The price of food has reached a 10-year high, posing a substantial risk, particularly for developing countries where food is a primary expense [00:11:02]. Historically, spikes in food prices have led to internal rebellions and conflicts [00:11:10].

*   **Historical Context:** In 2008 and 2011, soaring food prices contributed to internal rebellions, such as the Arab Spring, which saw revolts across Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, and Libya, even escalating into armed conflicts [00:11:33]. The food price index nearly doubled during these periods [00:12:18].
*   **Current Situation:** Global food prices in 2021 have returned to levels seen in 2011, indicating potential for renewed tensions if prices remain high [00:12:54].
*   **Economic Impact:** While not significantly affecting consumption in major global economies, high food prices create headlines and public reactions [00:12:30]. This issue is assigned a risk level of 2 out of 10 [00:12:44].
*   **Relation to [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | Inflation]]:** The rise in food prices contributes to overall [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], which can reduce consumer disposable income and lead to decreased consumption [00:13:25].

## Energy Crisis
The [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | energy crisis]] is another major concern, with European gas prices, for instance, multiplying nine times from their minimums [00:28:37].

*   **Price Increases:** Energy prices, including Brent oil, liquefied gas, German energy, and coal, have seen increases of 400% to 800%, a situation not observed in years [00:29:47].
*   **Impact on Consumers:** The rising cost of electricity and energy acts as a "tax" on consumers, as it is an essential expense [00:29:19]. This reduces money available for discretionary spending like vacations, restaurants, or car purchases, which typically drive business profits and stock market performance [00:29:29].
*   **Investment Implications:**
    *   **Energy Companies:** Energy companies benefit from an [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] scenario, making them a popular investment sector with good performance in recent months [00:30:22].
    *   **Cyclical Nature:** Energy companies are cyclical. When prices rise, dormant oil and gas wells are reactivated, a process that takes three to six months [00:30:37]. Similarly, when prices fall, extraction is halted [00:30:57].
    *   **Supply Issues:** Reduced investment in oil and gas in recent years, partly due to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) factors, has led to insufficient supply to meet demand, driving prices up [00:31:32].
    *   **Consequences:** A permanent season of high energy prices would contribute to [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], leading to higher interest rates, which is identified as one of the main risks for an [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | economic crisis]] [00:31:48]. This scenario also leads to market volatility [00:32:00].
*   **Transportation Crisis:** Directly linked to energy costs, transportation prices (e.g., bulk freight, container costs) have also skyrocketed [00:32:03].
    *   **Container Costs:** Prices for containers from the US to China have increased 6 to 10 times since March 2020 [00:32:32].
    *   **Impact on Businesses:** High transport costs reduce company profit margins [00:33:44], leading to lower stock market prices [00:33:33].
    *   **Transitory Nature:** The transportation crisis is considered a transitory risk, as it stems from a destruction of transport capacity during lockdowns, followed by a rapid economic reopening [00:33:50]. The market needs time to build or convert more ships and airplanes to meet demand [00:34:03]. This risk is assigned a level of 3 out of 10 [00:34:34].

## Mitigating Factors for Crises
To navigate periods of high [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] and economic uncertainty, it is crucial to invest in businesses with specific characteristics [00:15:31]:

*   High return on invested capital [00:15:36]
*   High profit margins [00:15:38]
*   Non-cyclical operations [00:15:41]
*   Reasonable valuations [00:15:43]
*   Lower capital intensity (e.g., technology, consumer staples) [00:16:23]
*   Ability to easily raise prices without losing customers [00:16:57]
*   Provide essential services that people cannot do without (e.g., telecommunications, utilities) [00:20:06]

Sectors like [[energy_and_raw_material_markets_under_geopolitical_tensions | energy and raw materials]] and real estate may perform well during [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], but they carry higher risks and volatility if [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] does not persist [00:15:49].

The current economic landscape has raised concerns among many investors about a potential new crisis in 2021, following a difficult year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Prominent investors like Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Michael Burry have issued warnings and advice regarding the future of the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article explores the new risks affecting the economy and stock market, methods to protect investments, and analyzes investment opportunities in high-growth stocks, particularly during periods of [[investment_strategies_during_market_uncertainty | market uncertainty]] and [[investment_strategies_for_economic_crises | economic instability]].

## Current Market Risks and Investor Concerns

Recent news of a mutated problem capable of faster transmission has caused panic among investors, leading to flight cancellations, border closures, and new containment measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This has particularly affected stocks related to the current crisis, such as airlines, hotels, and catering companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The effectiveness of current remedies against new variants remains uncertain, contributing to significant [[investment_strategies_during_market_uncertainty | market uncertainty]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

Adding to the complexity, new economic stimulus measures approved in the US were much lower than anticipated (around $900 billion, half of market expectations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The Federal Reserve and these stimulus measures were crucial for the 2020 recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Warnings from Major Investors

*   **Warren Buffett:** He has urged the American government to increase stimulus measures to avoid an economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Buffett emphasizes the importance of providing liquidity to families and corporations during times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Stanley Druckenmiller:** He expressed concern about "absolute euphoria" in the markets, stating that "after the party comes the hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Druckenmiller believes the next 3 to 5 years will be "very, very complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Bull markets often end when euphoria appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Joel Greenblatt:** He warned of significant market euphoria, noting that in 2020, buying every company that lost money in 2019 but had a market capitalization over a billion dollars would have yielded an impressive 65% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This indicates that the basic principles of investment, where companies must produce profits to justify valuation, are being forgotten <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Signs of Market Euphoria

One of the biggest signs of current euphoria is that the traded volume of options has, for the first time, been greater than the traded volume of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Options are leveraged instruments that involve debt, meaning their value rises much faster when the market climbs but falls much more rapidly, potentially losing all value, when the market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Goldman Sachs data shows that the volume of traded options reached record levels, up to $400 billion, over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.

## Valuing High-Growth Stocks with Current Losses

While investing consistently in companies that lose money typically leads to negative or lower returns, exceptions exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Companies like Amazon or Netflix produced losses for years before becoming highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

A three-step method can be used to value high-growth companies that are currently producing losses:

1.  **Estimate Future Sales:** Project the company's sales in three to five years, assuming a growth rate lower than its current rate (e.g., if growing at 40%, assume 30% for future estimates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. This accounts for the natural slowdown as companies gain scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.
2.  **Estimate Future Profit Margins:** Determine the potential profit margins once the company reaches a maturity phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. Look at comparable mature companies in the same sector (e.g., Toyota/Volkswagen for auto, Microsoft/Google for tech/software) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. This provides a future profit figure that, when divided by outstanding shares, yields earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier:** Apply an appropriate profit multiplier (P/E ratio) to the calculated future earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
    *   For good industries with expected continued growth (e.g., technology), a multiplier of 30 to 40 times earnings might be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
    *   For more cyclical industries (e.g., automotive), a lower multiplier of 15 to 20 times profits might be more suitable, even with growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## Case Studies: High-Growth Stocks

### NIO (NIO)

*   **Description:** The Chinese version of Tesla, trading under ticker NIV at $48 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It multiplied by more than 12 times in 2020, despite having losses in the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
*   **Valuation using 3-step method:**
    1.  **Future Sales:** Estimated at $47 billion for the next two years, with potential to reach $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.
    2.  **Net Profit Margins:** Based on companies like Volkswagen or Toyota (around 6%), NIO could achieve $3 million in net profit from $50 billion in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>. This results in future earnings per share of around $2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
    3.  **Valuation Multiple:** Applying a multiple of 15 times for the automotive sector, the intrinsic valuation is around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** Based on this method, NIO appears to be trading above its fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, a strong conviction that NIO could reach $100 billion in sales could justify a higher value of up to $80 per share, implying $4 profit per share at a 15-20x multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. High-growth investments have a wider range of possible outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA)

*   **Description:** A highly popular stock that multiplied by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. It had losses in 2019 but began generating profits in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 index propelled shares to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Michael Burry's Stance:** Investor Michael Burry (featured in "The Big Short") declared he is investing against Tesla due to its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. He noted Tesla's market capitalization of over $600 billion is higher than other traditional automobile manufacturers, despite Tesla generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Market Valuation per Vehicle:** Bloomberg compared the market value per vehicle produced for electric vs. traditional manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Tesla is assigned over a million dollars per vehicle, while Volkswagen is assigned $10,000, Toyota $25,000, and BMW $26,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** Investing against a stock can be extremely dangerous and requires significant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. While Tesla's current profits are low, it has the capacity for drastic future increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Investors should conduct a detailed study of the company's evolution rather than investing solely based on recent price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Palantir Technologies (PLTR)

*   **Description:** Listed in the US under ticker PL, priced at $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. It has more than tripled since its listing three months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Palantir is a high-growth technology company with unique technology for analyzing large amounts of data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. It is currently in a phase of producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.
*   **Valuation using 3-step method:**
    1.  **Future Sales:** Expected to invoice around $1.4 billion in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Assuming a conservative 40% annual growth (less than current 50%), sales could reach $7.5 billion in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    2.  **Net Profit Margins:** Based on mature technology companies like Microsoft, Oracle, or Google (20-25% margins), Palantir could achieve potential profits of $1.8 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. With approximately 1.75 billion shares, this translates to earnings per share of $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
    3.  **Valuation Multiple:** Applying a 30x multiplier (common for high-quality technology companies), the fair value for Palantir is around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** The current stock market price largely incorporates the expectation of future benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This simplified method offers a wide range of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. A firm conviction in Palantir's very high growth over 10-15 years could justify a higher intrinsic value and interesting realization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Alibaba (BABA)

*   **Description:** Listed in the US under ticker AVE at $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.
*   **Recent Events:** The Chinese government launched an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. Some speculate this is a message to founder Jack Ma, who has been critical of the Communist Party's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. In jurisdictions with fewer investor rights, such actions can lead to stock market losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.
*   **Financials:** From a financial perspective, Alibaba's current valuation is attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Its intrinsic value could potentially be double the current price, with significant future growth expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.
*   **Conclusion:** Unlike other investments, the financial factor is currently less relevant for Alibaba in the short and medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Monitoring the evolution of the situation and the company's cooperation with government guidelines is crucial for future progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Protecting Investments from New Risks

In these situations, investing with common sense is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. Investing against the market or waiting 100% in cash are not good ideas, as inflation would erode capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:13">[00:18:13]</a>.

Here are three key pieces of advice for investors in 2021:

1.  **Maintain Liquidity:** Have some liquidity in the portfolio (10-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Statistically, the market corrects at least 10% every year, providing opportunities to capitalize on with cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
2.  **Invest with Conviction:** Only invest in companies where you have strong conviction and have conducted an in-depth analysis to confirm it's a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Even in a euphoric or expensive market, good [[investment_strategy during a stock market crisis | investment opportunities]] can always be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
3.  **Monitor Major Investors:** Observe how major investors (like Stanley Druckenmiller or Michael Burry) are positioning their portfolios in response to new risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. For example, Druckenmiller's main investments include high-growth, high-profit margin companies like Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Michael Burry's main investments focus on Google, Pfizer, and pharmaceutical company ACWT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. Information on these portfolios can often be found for free online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

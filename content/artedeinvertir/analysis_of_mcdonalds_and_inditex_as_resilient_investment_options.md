## McDonald's (MCD)

McDonald's is a globally recognized company listed in the US under the ticker MCD. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a> Over the last 40 years since its public listing, McDonald's has delivered significant returns, multiplying its value by over 1,000 times. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a> A small investment of $1,000 decades ago would be worth over $1 million today. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:00">[06:23:00]</a>

### Business Model: A Real Estate Powerhouse

A key insight into McDonald's success, explored in the movie "The Founder," is its focus on the real estate business rather than solely being a restaurant business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>

*   **Franchise Model:** McDonald's does not directly operate most of its restaurants. Instead, franchisees run them and pay McDonald's a commission or royalty on each sale. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:45:00">[06:45:00]</a> This model requires minimal investment and yields high margins for the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:55:00">[06:55:00]</a>
*   **Real Estate Ownership:** In addition to franchising, McDonald's strategically owns the land and buildings where many of its restaurants are located. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a> This provides several advantages:
    *   Ability to periodically increase rents for franchisees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>
    *   Greater control over franchisees. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>
    *   Long-term appreciation of real estate assets, which can be financed with low-cost debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>
*   **Income Composition:** The majority of McDonald's income comes from real estate rentals. Last year, out of over $11 billion in franchisee income, $7.5 billion was from renting real estate properties. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a> Royalties from food and drink sales constitute a smaller portion of their revenue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a> This structure leads to the saying that McDonald's is primarily a real estate business. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>

### Resilience and Future Prospects

McDonald's business model demonstrates resilience across various economic environments.

*   **Economic Stability:** Even in challenging years like 2008, McDonald's achieved positive results, with shares only falling 20% while the broader market dropped up to 60%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>
*   **Current Crisis Impact:** The company is minimally affected by crises, as over 70% of its income comes from rents, which franchisees must continue to pay regardless of restaurant operational status. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a> While royalties from sales were impacted by temporary closures, McDonald's strong pick-up and delivery services helped mitigate losses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a> Sales are estimated to drop by only 12% for the current year but are expected to rebound by over 15% the following year, quickly restoring profitability and earnings per share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>
*   **Growth Drivers:** McDonald's, though mature, grows through:
    *   Expansion into emerging countries with growing middle classes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>
    *   Opening new restaurants. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>
    *   Price increases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
    *   Share buyback programs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>
*   **Valuation:** McDonald's shares rarely trade cheaply due to the business's strong characteristics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a> They trade at a P/E of 22 times future earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:13:00">[09:13:00]</a> Earnings per share are projected to grow between 7% and 12% annually. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a> This suggests a 5-year target price between $250 and $320 per share, offering interesting potential for a high-quality company that also pays a high dividend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>

## Inditex (ITX)

Inditex, listed under the ticker ITX in Spain, is the owner of the famous Zara clothing stores and is considered one of Spain's best-listed companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:00">[12:39:00]</a> Founded by Amancio Ortega, Inditex achieved tremendous success with its fast fashion concept, making Ortega one of the wealthiest individuals globally. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>

### Business Model and Competitive Advantages

Inditex possesses a highly resilient business model supported by strong competitive advantages:

*   **Distribution, Design, and Culture:** The company excels in distribution, design, and its overall business culture. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>
*   **Online Adaptation:** Unlike some rivals, Inditex has successfully adapted to the digital era, with over 20% of its sales now online. Its online system is recognized as one of the world's best by experts. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>
*   **Property Ownership & Debt-Free:** A significant advantage for Inditex is that it owns most of its retail premises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:37:00">[13:37:00]</a> This removes the pressure of paying rents, which can drive other retail companies to bankruptcy. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a> Additionally, Inditex has no debt, ensuring its long-term viability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:00">[13:47:00]</a>

### Future Growth and Valuation

Inditex, while mature, has inherent capabilities for future growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:53:00">[13:53:00]</a>

*   **International Expansion:** There is significant room for international expansion. For example, Germany, with twice Spain's population and greater purchasing power, only has 80 Zara stores compared to Spain's over 300. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a>
*   **Comparable Sales:** Monitoring "comparable sales" or "same-store sales" is crucial for retail companies. This metric excludes new stores to assess true growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:00">[14:15:00]</a> Inditex's comparable sales have been solid and consistent over time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a> The company projects comparable sales growth of 4% to 6% in the coming years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:00">[14:49:00]</a>
*   **Overall Growth Projection:** Adding new store openings to comparable sales growth could bring total annual growth to almost 10%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:00">[14:57:00]</a>
*   **Valuation:** Inditex shares typically do not trade at attractive valuations due to the market's awareness of its high quality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:00">[15:18:00]</a> When stores fully reopen, Inditex is estimated to earn over one euro per share, resulting in a current P/E of 24 times earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:26:00">[15:26:00]</a> This is a demanding valuation but is justified by the company's quality. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:34:00">[15:34:00]</a> Future performance will be driven by earnings per share growth rather than multiple expansion. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>
*   **Dividend:** Inditex also pays a 3% annual dividend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>
*   **Target Price:** Based on projected growth and dividends, a 5-year target price is estimated between 35 and 45 euros per share, offering interesting potential from the current trading price of 24 euros. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:02:00">[16:02:00]</a> This is for a company with no debt, strong competitive advantages, and good future prospects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:13:00">[16:13:00]</a>

## Conclusion

Both McDonald's and Inditex are presented as high-quality companies with resilient business models that can withstand economic challenges. Their strategic advantages, such as McDonald's real estate holdings and Inditex's property ownership and debt-free status, position them well for future growth and profitability, even in volatile markets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:00">[13:35:00]</a> The analysis of specific investment opportunities for these companies suggests they are worth attention.

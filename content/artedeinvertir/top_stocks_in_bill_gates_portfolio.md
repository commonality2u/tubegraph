While widely known for co-founding Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, he is also recognized as an exceptional investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. His investment portfolio is substantial, exceeding $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> and heavily concentrated, with 80-90% of its value in just six stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. As of the time of the transcript, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] holds a fortune of $110 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, with this portfolio representing half of his total investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Philosophy
[[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] consistently invests in market leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, avoiding second or third-best companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This approach contributes to the success of his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. His portfolio demonstrates a preference for predictable businesses with strong market positions and visible growth plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. He tends to focus on companies with double-digit profit growth, even if sales growth is lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. Another key characteristic is his aversion to overpaying for shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>, often investing when valuations are reasonable or below historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates' Focus on Defensive Investments and Sectors]] is also evident, as many of his holdings are in essential, less cyclical industries. His investment style is concentrated, typically avoiding holding 30-40 different shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>.

## Top Holdings by Portfolio Weight

### 6. John Deere (3.7% Weight)
John Deere, an industrial machinery company, accounts for 3.7% of the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] has shown a strong bullish stance on food production in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, citing concerns about potential shortages and population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. Beyond investing in agricultural equipment companies, he is one of the largest landowners in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

John Deere is a clear market leader in its sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>, with approximately 60% of American farmers utilizing its machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. The business is cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, with farmers delaying new machinery purchases during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>, but it has always been profitable and cash-flow positive, ensuring survival through economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Since the Covid-19 pandemic, rising food and raw material prices have benefited John Deere, leading to a strong rise in its stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. The company has continuously increased dividends for over 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>, with a 64% increase since 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Profit margins from equipment sales have increased to nearly 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, with some believing this is due to overinvestment, though similar periods of high profitability have lasted for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. John Deere is also benefiting from artificial intelligence and technological advancements, such as self-driving tractors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, which provide a significant competitive advantage over smaller rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The company invests nearly $2 billion annually in research and development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. The agricultural equipment market is projected to grow at 7% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>, more than double the economic growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] likely anticipates more than 10% growth from John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. The stock currently trades at 11 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>, a valuation close to its Covid lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.

### 5. Caterpillar (4.3% Weight)
Caterpillar is the fifth-largest company in the portfolio, with a 4.3% weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. The company benefits from significant tailwinds in its three main markets: general construction, mining, and public works/infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. There is a current investment deficit in these areas, particularly in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Both presidential candidates, Biden and Trump, have expressed intentions to modernize U.S. infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

Caterpillar is the leading company in its machinery sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>, and its investment in technology is likely to further increase its competitive gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Despite being cyclical, it has paid attractive dividends, similar to John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The company's historical numbers have improved, with 20% growth in 2021 and 16% in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>, rebounding from a downward cycle in raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Profit margins are stable around 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Caterpillar is considered a "dividend king" or "dividend aristocrat" due to its consistent dividend payments for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. In 2022, the company saw record share buybacks of $4.2 billion, indicating management believes the shares are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Increased infrastructure spending in the U.S. is expected to continue through 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>, driving demand for Caterpillar's equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>. The mining sector also presents opportunities due to potential metal shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Furthermore, oil and gas exploration and production spending is projected to increase dramatically by 2025-2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>, a sector where Caterpillar is a major machinery supplier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. The company anticipates sales reaching $72 billion (from current $60 billion) with expanding margins due to economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Caterpillar can potentially grow profits by 20-25% annually when factoring in share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The stock currently trades at 13 times earnings, below its 5-year average of 18 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>, making it an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

### 4. Waste Management (14.5% Weight)
Waste Management holds a significant 14.5% of [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates' portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>. Despite its seemingly unglamorous business of waste collection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>, it has proven to be highly lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>. It is the market leader in a sector controlled by a few companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>.

This business is highly predictable and essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>. During the 2007-2011 crisis, Waste Management maintained its performance, not growing but also not decreasing, which the market highly values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. This contributes to its low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>. The waste collection market in the U.S. is projected to grow at 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. The company is making substantial investments (incremental capex of $500M-$1B in 2023-2024) in recycling and sustainable economy services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>, which are expected to accelerate growth from 2025 onwards, with EBITDA potentially increasing by $600-$800 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.

Waste Management's business plan forecasts 8-9% annual sales growth and even higher profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>. With share buybacks, earnings per share could grow by over 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>. As a more mature business, it also offers a strong dividend component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. Given its less cyclical nature, the market assigns a higher multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. It currently trades at 25 times earnings, which is around its recent historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:36">[00:25:36]</a>. This is considered a reasonable valuation for a company of its quality, not indicative of a bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>.

### 3. Canadian National Railway (15.7% Weight)
Canadian National Railway is the third-largest position in the portfolio, representing 15.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. It is a dominant rail transport company in Canada that recently merged with Kansas City Southern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>, creating a strong North American network connecting southern Canada with the U.S. Gulf of Mexico for raw material transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.

Rail transport is a cost-effective means for very heavy merchandise not requiring immediate delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>. With only a few companies controlling most of the business, they possess strong pricing power and market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:55">[00:27:55]</a>. These businesses have become less cyclical as the demand for raw material transport is relatively constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. Building parallel railway lines is extremely difficult due to regulatory hurdles, establishing these companies as local monopolies, a characteristic favored by investors like [[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>.

The stock has shown impressive growth, multiplying almost 100 times in 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a>, with low volatility, similar to Waste Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. Other strong companies in the sector, like BNSF (owned by [[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett]]) and Union Pacific, have also performed well, indicating a robust sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>. All companies [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] invests in, including Canadian National Railway, have a solid and growing dividend payment, often complemented by share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>. In 2022, Canadian National Railway had a record year for share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>. The company aims to reach $10 in earnings per share within the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>, projecting 10-15% annual profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:17">[00:33:17]</a>. Despite a slight decrease in sales and profit growth in 2023 due to raw material prices and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>, it is expected to recover to record profits in the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:10">[00:34:10]</a>. The stock is currently valued at 20 times earnings, matching its 5-year historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

### 2. Berkshire Hathaway (20% Weight)
Berkshire Hathaway is the second-largest position, representing 20% of the portfolio, an investment of almost $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>. This holding makes sense given [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates']] close friendship with [[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway operates with two main business lines: owning 100% of private companies like Duracell, Geico, and See's Candies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>, and holding minority stakes (listed shares) in companies like Moody's, Apple, and Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.

Berkshire Hathaway has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 across various timeframes with low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. Its stock, once trading at $1,000 in 1983, has multiplied by 500 times to $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>. The most important metric for analysis is book value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:39">[00:37:39]</a>, which has shown an incessant and harmonious increase over 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:50">[00:37:50]</a>. While the book value experienced slight drops during crises like 2008 and 2022 (due to market valuation of its listed shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:01">[00:38:01]</a>, it has recovered to new historical highs in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:25">[00:38:25]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett]] has stated that a fair multiple for Berkshire Hathaway is 1.6 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>, though the market often values it slightly lower at 1.4 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:20">[00:39:20]</a>. The company's share buybacks, particularly during periods like Covid (2020-2021), have often correlated with good stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is known for holding a cash pile exceeding $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, which ensures business viability and provides capital for future acquisition opportunities, especially during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:52">[00:41:52]</a>. This cash reserve allows for increased book value per share at a faster rate when bargains emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:11">[00:42:11]</a>.

### 1. Microsoft (31% Weight)
Microsoft is the largest position, with a massive 31% weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>. [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] holds these shares through his holding company and personally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>, making it over 50% of his assets and potentially an investment of over $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. As the company's founder, he has deep knowledge of the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>.

In 2022, when tech stocks declined, [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] was actively buying Microsoft shares at $220-$230 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>; the stock later rose to $320-$350 within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Microsoft has three main business lines:
*   **Hardware (Xbox, peripherals)**: This is the weakest and most volatile segment, representing a small percentage of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
*   **Office 365 Ecosystem (Windows, Word, PowerPoint, Excel)**: This segment boasts enormous competitive advantages due to its network effect and successful migration to a subscription model, allowing for consistent price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. It is expected to grow at 10-15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
*   **Cloud (Microsoft Azure) and Artificial Intelligence**: This is considered the jewel in the crown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>, benefiting from [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_vaccine_stocks | Artificial Intelligence]] integration (e.g., GPT chat, where Microsoft is a major shareholder) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:02">[00:45:02]</a>. This segment is projected to grow at 15-20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33">[00:45:33]</a>.

Microsoft's stock has multiplied by 4,000 times since its inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:06">[00:46:06]</a>, making it one of the most profitable investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. After a period of stagnation due to high initial valuations (60x earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>, the stock began a significant climb around 2012 when it was trading at 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:46">[00:46:46]</a>. Latest results show benefits growing 20% and earnings per share 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. The company anticipates continued double-digit growth rates in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>. While Bill Gates previously engaged in [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | selling shares]] to diversify or finance philanthropic work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:07">[00:49:07]</a>, his decision to maintain his Microsoft investment reflects continued optimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:59">[00:48:59]</a>. Microsoft currently trades at 30 times earnings, slightly above its 5-6 year average of 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:49:26]</a>, which is influenced by the current excitement around [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_vaccine_stocks | Artificial Intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.

[[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]], a renowned economist and investor, has asserted that a new world order will usher in an unprecedented economic recession. He identifies three significant challenges that he considers the most crucial of our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. According to Dalio, an economic war is brewing that could lead to the decline of the United States and its allies in favor of China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He has indicated that the [[global_economic_power_shifts_by_2030 | economic outlook will change drastically]] around a specific date <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This shift will have major consequences on the value of money, investments, and currencies like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio's]] Influence and Insights

[[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] holds significant global economic influence and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He is a regular attendee at the [[the_role_of_the_world_economic_forum_in_global_economic_reforms | Davos forum meetings]] and is the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, managing over $100 trillion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. His opinions are highly respected due to his success in navigating major economic crises, such as those in 2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Dalio recently summarized this new economic scenario in his book, "The New World Order," emphasizing the need for preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. In a recent interview with CNBC, he elaborated on the date when he believes significant changes will begin and the reasons behind his views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He stated, "these three forces are the greatest that I have seen in my entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Historically, the simultaneous occurrence of these three problems has led to economic recessions and major changes, culminating in the downfall of empires and major world currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## Three Major Challenges Leading to Economic Change

1.  **Class Struggle and the Widening Social Gap**
    The first problem worrying [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] is the class struggle, or the social gap, between "capitalism and communism" and between "those who have and those who don't," with both sides seeking victory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:00">[02:13:00]</a>. This gap is increasingly widening, creating future tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Data shows that 1% of the American population owns progressively more wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Recent inflation has exacerbated this disparity, disproportionately affecting the poorest 50% who lack assets like stocks or real estate that offer protection against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

2.  **Enormous Debt and its Consequences**
    The second problem is the immense debt accumulated by both the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] notes a decreasing demand for United States debt, considering American bonds a very risky investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. He predicts two potential outcomes: either interest rates for debt will rise, or the state will have to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>. Printing more money to resolve recessions will lead to higher inflation, further widening the gap between the rich and the poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. Dalio predicts that "in 5 years we will see a totally different world than the current one due to the rise of China, the class struggle and the debt bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. Technological advancements, such as Artificial Intelligence, could also introduce unpredictable scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

3.  **The Rise of China and the Decline of the United States**
    The third major concern [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] highlights is the ascendancy of China and the anticipated decline of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:35:00">[04:35:00]</a>. This shift would significantly impact the value of the dollar and its status as a global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>. While the United States has dominated the international political landscape for the past 70 years by controlling institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, this is poised to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>. Dalio suggests the United States is entering a decline phase marked by high debt levels, social struggles, and currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>, while China is in an ascending phase of wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio's]] Recommendations for Investors

In light of this complex environment, [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] offers the following advice for small investors:

1.  **Invest to Prevent Money from Losing Value Due to Inflation**
    Investors should adopt a global perspective on their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The primary way to prevent money from losing value to inflation is to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. As more money has been printed and new debt created, the value of assets like stocks or [[the_role_of_gold_in_a_new_economic_environment | gold]] has increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. He advises against holding what are traditionally considered "safe" investments, such as liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>, fixed income, and liquidity, as their value typically declines in inflationary scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>. Instead, real assets with consistent demand, such as stocks, real estate investments, or [[the_role_of_gold_in_a_new_economic_environment | gold]], are expected to perform much better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

2.  **Diversify Globally Without Reducing Performance Expectations**
    Given the uncertain and risky future, learning to diversify is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Effective diversification can reduce risk by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>. Dalio consistently recommends investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. He popularized the "four seasons" portfolio management theory, an effective tool for portfolio management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio's]] Current Investment Moves

An examination of [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio's]] latest published portfolio reveals his preferred sector is technology, with current investments in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Conversely, he is selling shares in the banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, as these are sensitive to the economic cycle and may face future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

While he traditionally holds a significant portion of his portfolio in debt or long-term bonds, his main positions are now in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. Another favored sector for the current environment is stable or defensive consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>.

[[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] has also invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF (IWM), which comprises 2,000 major small-cap companies in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. Historically, when interest rates decrease and liquidity increases in the system, small-cap stocks tend to outperform the market average and large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

The global economy in 2022 faces significant risks, among them the ongoing energy and transport crises, which contribute to inflation and economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These crises reduce consumer disposable income and impact business profits, potentially leading to [[Stock market fluctuations and potential crisis | stock market downturns]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

## Energy Crisis

The [[Energy crisis and geopolitical tensions | energy crisis]] is considered a highly impactful risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:37">[02:28:37]</a>. European energy prices, particularly for gas, have multiplied by a factor of 9 from their minimums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:41">[02:28:41]</a>. This surge, combined with rising food and transport costs, has driven [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation]] to its highest levels in 40 years in the United States and 30 years in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:50">[02:28:50]</a>.

### Impacts of the Energy Crisis

The increase in electricity and energy prices acts as a de facto tax on consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:19">[02:29:19]</a>. This means less disposable income for discretionary spending like vacations, restaurants, or car purchases, which ultimately affects business profits and [[Stock market fluctuations and potential crisis | stock market valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:19">[02:29:19]</a>. Significant price increases (400%-800%) have been observed across various energy sources, including Brent oil, liquefied gas, German energy, and coal, creating substantial uncertainty for the economy in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

### Implications for Investments

*   **Energy Companies:** Energy companies can benefit from an [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation]] scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. However, these are often cyclical businesses. Reactivating oil and gas wells, for instance, takes 3 to 6 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Supply Issues:** Historically, ESG (Environmental, Social, and Governance) trends have disincentivized investment in oil and gas production, leading to insufficient supply when demand remains constant, causing prices to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Wider Economic Impact:** A sustained period of high energy prices directly leads to [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation]], which in turn drives up interest rates, posing a significant risk for an economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>. This situation also increases market [[Stock market fluctuations and potential crisis | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.

## Transport Crisis

The [[Transport crisis and its economic impact | transport crisis]] is closely linked to the energy crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>. Prices for bulk freight transport, as indicated by the Baltic Dry Index, have soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. The cost of shipping containers, particularly on routes like the US to China, has increased by 4 to 5 times, and in some cases, up to 10 times since March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:00">[03:28:00]</a>.

### Impacts of the Transport Crisis

Rising transport costs directly reduce companies' profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. This can lead to lower corporate profits and, consequently, lower [[Stock market fluctuations and potential crisis | stock market prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.

### Causes and Mitigation

The transport crisis is largely a transitory risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. During the confinement crisis, a significant amount of transport capacity was lost due to company bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>. While the economy has reopened, the supply of ships, airplanes, and other transport infrastructure has not yet met the renewed demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. This imbalance, requiring the construction or conversion of more transport assets, takes time to resolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### General Mitigation Strategies for Crisis Environments

To navigate these crises and mitigate [[Impacts of Global Crises on the Economy | economic impacts]], certain investment strategies are recommended:
*   **Fixed-Rate Debts:** It is ideal to have fixed-rate debts for the longest possible term at a low interest rate to avoid impact when interest rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.
*   **Monitor Valuations:** In an environment of rising interest rates, it is crucial to avoid buying assets at any price, especially speculative stocks trading at high multiples of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Easy money encourages speculation, which can inflate asset valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Investing:** Investing in good companies with no debt, strong management, and reasonable valuations usually leads to satisfactory long-term results in a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quality Businesses:**
    *   Companies with high return on invested capital and high-profit margins tend to perform well in inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
    *   Sectors like energy, raw materials, and real estate can also do well, but they may carry higher risk or volatility if inflation does not persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:00">[15:49:00]</a>.
    *   Less capital-intensive businesses are generally better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:23:00">[16:23:00]</a>. For example, Google, which doesn't need to invest heavily in physical assets, can more easily raise prices while maintaining costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:38:00">[16:38:00]</a>.
    *   Companies selling essential consumer products (e.g., toothpaste, cleaners) like Procter & Gamble are less affected by economic downturns, as consumers continue to purchase them regardless of price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.
    *   Businesses where consumers cannot easily forgo services, such as telecommunications companies (internet, electricity, water), also tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid High Concentration:** Do not concentrate portfolios in high-risk sectors or regions, such as overly focusing on [[Geopolitical risks | China]] or industries highly susceptible to crises (e.g., tourism or airlines during a pandemic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:45:00">[26:45:00]</a>.
*   **Be Aware of Speculative Investments:** Avoid investing in areas driven by euphoria, such as meme stocks, certain tech IPOs, or cryptocurrencies, as these tend to experience parabolic rises followed by sharp corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:41:00">[35:41:00]</a>.
*   **Maintain Common Sense:** Investing with common sense, focusing on good companies with low debt and reasonable valuations, is paramount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:31:00">[37:31:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** All crises eventually pass. The world tends to progress, with increasing wealth, decreasing poverty, and technological advances, which are powerful long-term forces for prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:28:00">[38:28:00]</a>. The [[Stock market fluctuations and potential crisis | stock market]] reflects this economic progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:13:00">[39:13:00]</a>.

[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]], considered an "outsider" in financial markets due to his innovations, started managing investments over 45 years ago with just $10,000 from his apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. He now manages over $130 billion, overseeing the world's largest investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>. His investment system, the [[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | All Weather Portfolio]], was initially private but was made public due to its tremendous success, providing predictable results with very low risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

The original [[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | All Weather Portfolio]] was designed to perform well in all four economic seasons, characterized by combinations of high/low inflation and high/low economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>. It aimed to be resilient to unpredictable market conditions, much like a house built to withstand any weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>.

## Original [[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | All Weather Portfolio]] Allocations
[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] recommended working primarily with four asset classes: shares, bonds, commodities, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. For small investors, these could be replicated through ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>. The suggested initial weightings were:
*   **30%** in large-cap American stocks (e.g., S&P 500 ETF, ticker: SPY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **40%** in long-term American bonds (e.g., iShares Treasury Bonds at 20 years, ticker: TLT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:00">[10:29:00]</a>.
*   **15%** in medium-term American bonds (e.g., iShares Treasury Bonds at 3-7 years, ticker: IEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.
*   **7.5%** in commodities (e.g., iShares Commodity Index, ticker: GSC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:22:00">[11:22:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>.
*   **7.5%** in gold (e.g., SPDR Gold Shares, ticker: GLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:00">[11:57:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>.

This portfolio requires rebalancing every 12 months to maintain the original asset weights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:00">[12:51:00]</a>.

## Current Adjustments to the Strategy
While [[ray_dalios_investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Ray Dalio]] continues to use his [[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | All Weather Strategy]] for his investment funds, he is currently applying certain changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. By observing the public portfolio of his firm, Bridgewater, these shifts become apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

The three main changes observed are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>:

### 1. Reduction in Bonds
[[ray_dalios_investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Ray Dalio]] has slightly reduced the weight of bonds in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:00">[14:50:00]</a>. This capital has been redirected towards other asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

### 2. Increased Gold Exposure
The allocation to gold has been significantly increased. Bridgewater's portfolio now shows more than **15%** in gold, comprising a GLD ETF (over 11%) and another gold ETF (4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. This is double the original 7.5% recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:40:00">[14:40:00]</a>.

### 3. Increased Allocation to International Stocks
While maintaining a significant position in large-cap American stocks (currently around 24% through SPY and IVV ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>, [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] has also increased his exposure to international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:56:00">[14:56:00]</a>. This includes investments in ETFs for international stocks like those from India (XE and NBA tickers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>, as well as over 6% of his portfolio in ETFs from emerging countries or large-cap stocks from nations like Brazil or Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:20:00">[14:20:00]</a>.

These changes highlight [[ray_dalios_market_predictions | Ray Dalio's]] ongoing adaptation of his [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | investment advice and portfolio strategies]] to current market conditions, particularly regarding [[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | inflation warnings]] and global economic shifts.

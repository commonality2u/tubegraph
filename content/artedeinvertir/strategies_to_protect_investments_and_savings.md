The global economy is facing a significant economic scenario, with warnings of a potential financial system collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Janet Yellen, the current Director of the American Treasury and former Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, has stated that without a solution in the coming weeks, irreversible damage could occur to the American economy and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## The Debt Ceiling Crisis

The United States is nearing its debt limit, a cap on the amount of debt the government can issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:08">[03:08:08]</a>. This limit was established because the US, like most countries, consistently spends more money than it earns, leading to a fiscal deficit that is financed by issuing new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>. Janet Yellen has criticized the arbitrary debt ceiling as "tremendously irresponsible" for periodically creating crises that risk financial and economic stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>.

To manage the current situation, the Treasury has begun taking "extraordinary measures," including significantly cutting investments in pension and health plans, and suspending investments for government employee retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:16">[01:52:16]</a>. These cuts amount to over 200 billion American dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:05">[02:21:05]</a>. Yellen warned that these measures are temporary and likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:05">[09:03:05]</a>.

### The Trillion-Dollar Coin Solution

A highly risky and seemingly comical solution being considered is to mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:34">[06:58:34]</a>. This is possible due to a legal loophole in American law that allows the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:14">[07:58:14]</a>. These coins, if minted, would be deposited with the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to continue paying expenses without going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:52">[08:08:52]</a>. While this could work in the short term, it would not send a message of stability to financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:37">[08:37:37]</a>.

### Consequences of a Default

A US debt default would be akin to "gravity ceasing to exist," leading to total chaos and a financial collapse, impacting the entire global financial system due to its connection to American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>. The US debt bills and bonds represent the largest international asset class, with millions of entities worldwide holding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:34">[04:25:34]</a>. A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect on banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:02">[04:54:02]</a>. This situation is compared to the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse, but multiplied by 30 times due to the higher debt balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

The White House estimates that a default could lead to:
*   Over 2 million job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:53">[06:20:53]</a>
*   An additional annual cost of over 750 billion dollars in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:25:01">[06:25:01]</a>
*   A collapse of the dollar and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:57">[06:33:57]</a>

## [[Investment strategies and advice | Strategies to protect investments during financial crises]]

In a scenario of US debt default, while many investments would be harmed, a select group would likely rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:19:08">[05:19:08]</a>.

### Assets That Would Fall
*   **Dollar bonds and fixed income**: Their value would collapse as investors lose confidence in the United States, leading to enormous capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:26:00">[05:26:00]</a>.
*   **Stocks and equity investments**: The value of most stocks would fall sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>.

### Assets That Would Rise
*   **Gold**: The price of gold would likely rise sharply because its price is measured against the US dollar. A dollar collapse would reflect a significant increase in gold's value, providing a safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Gold-related stocks**: Companies in the gold sector, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDs)**: These are insurance policies against government debt default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:41">[03:20:41]</a>. The price to insure American government debt has already multiplied by more than nine times due to the risk of collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>. Large investors like Ray Dalio use these to protect against default risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.

### Betting Against the Market
Some investors are considering betting against the US government debt and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs**: These exchange-traded funds are designed to increase in value when the market goes down, typically by investing in derivatives that bet against the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
    *   **Note**: Inverse ETFs have historically performed poorly in the long term because the stock market tends to revalue over time. They are generally used tactically for short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>. An example is the ProShares Short S&P500 (SH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.

### White House Projections on Stock Market Decline
The White House has estimated that in a debt default scenario, the stock market could experience drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.

### Historical Context
Similar debt limit scenarios were reached in 2011 and 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. Even when temporary solutions were found, the markets experienced high volatility in the following weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.

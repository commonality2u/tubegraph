Defensive stocks are a key component of [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | investment strategies]] aimed at preserving capital and generating more stable returns, particularly during periods of economic uncertainty or market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. These stocks are characterized by their ability to perform relatively well even when the broader market is declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Shift Towards Defensive Investments

Renowned investor Ray Dalio has recently adjusted his portfolio to be significantly more defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This shift comes amidst new warnings about a potential economic scenario marked by political polarization in the United States, a rotation of world power towards China, and a change in central bank policies from "easy money" to higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:06">[02:44:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Dalio predicts a future with much lower market returns (potentially 3-4% annually compared to the past 8-10%) and significantly higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

His portfolio adjustments indicate a clear strategic move:
*   **Selling High-Risk Assets** Dalio has sold 90% of his shares and reduced weight in nearly 300 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Notably, he sold almost all shares from emerging countries, as these are historically considered risky and tend to correct more during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.
*   **Purchasing Defensive Shares** His purchases, though smaller in percentage than his sales, have focused on defensive stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Examples include Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi (similar to Coca-Cola) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. These [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | types of stocks]] have shown minimal decline in recent volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

Dalio's actions suggest that during market downturns, these defensive stocks tend to fall much less than the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This strategic positioning is consistent with his past success in navigating market crises over the last 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

## Characteristics and Performance of Defensive Stocks

Defensive stocks generally exhibit a specific behavior across different market cycles:
*   **Bear Markets:** They typically experience less severe declines compared to the overall market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This is because their demand is often less sensitive to economic fluctuations.
*   **Bull Markets:** While they do tend to rise, their growth rate is usually slower than that of the broader market or higher-growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

### Examples of Defensive Stocks and Their Performance

*   **Procter & Gamble, Costco, Pepsi, Coca-Cola:** These are classic examples of defensive stocks that have shown resilience during recent market volatility, with very little decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics:** Michael Burry, another notable investor, has shown interest in General Dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:40">[02:27:40]</a>. This company manufactures military equipment, including nuclear submarines, with practically no competition, giving it a high competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:54">[02:53:54]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:30">[02:54:30]</a>. Its demand is tied to defense budgets, which are less cyclical than the general economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:58">[02:59:58]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:34">[02:37:34]</a>. Defense sector stocks generally do not fall much when the market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:29">[02:38:29]</a>. This demonstrates [[the_strategic_importance_of_defensive_investments | the strategic importance of defensive investments]] in a portfolio.
*   **EMT Group:** This is considered a very defensive business with good growth prospects and a reasonable valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:46">[02:46:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:49">[02:46:49]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:04">[02:47:04]</a>. In a crisis (excluding a virus-related one), it could capitalize on opportunities for cheap acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:47">[02:47:47]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:51">[02:49:51]</a>.

## Investment Approach during Volatility

In a volatile market, investors should focus on companies with strong fundamentals and reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>. This is critical for [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | protecting investments during economic downturns]]. When the market experiences significant drops, as seen recently with many overvalued technology stocks, it reveals companies with "reasonable valuations" that can hold up better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:29">[01:11:29]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:32">[01:11:32]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

An [[investment_strategy_during_a_stock_market_crisis | investment strategy during a stock market crisis]] often involves:
*   **Independent Thinking:** Investors should verify information and form their own opinions rather than blindly following headlines or popular narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:06">[01:18:06]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>.
*   **Valuation Focus:** Learning to value shares and understand a company's intrinsic worth is crucial, especially in a new economic scenario where overpriced stocks carry enormous risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.
*   **Patience and Opportunity:** Periods of market fear and panic, while uncomfortable, are often the best times for long-term investors to find and acquire high-quality assets at discounted prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:20">[01:00:20]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.

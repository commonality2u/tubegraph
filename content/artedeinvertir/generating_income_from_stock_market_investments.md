It is possible to live off the stock market and achieve a predictable and increasing income over time, though there are certain nuances to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Ways to Make Money from Stocks

There are two primary methods to generate income from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

### 1. Revaluation (Capital Gains)
This method involves buying a stock with the intention of selling it later at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.
*   **Challenges**:
    *   Requires other investors to be willing to pay more for the stocks in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
    *   Results tend to be less predictable and more volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
    *   Market recognition of value can take varied durations, from six months to two or three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

### 2. Dividends
This method involves investing in companies that periodically distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   Does not depend on other investors being willing to pay more for shares in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.
    *   Provides much more predictable income over time, especially from companies with stable and growing dividend payouts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   Some companies have paid stable and growing dividends for over 10, 20, or 30 years, even through crises like 2000, 2008, or 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Dual Benefit**: Companies typically reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business to foster future growth, meaning that in addition to dividends, there's often a component of future revaluation over the longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Structuring an Investment Portfolio for Dividends

To achieve a consistent profitability objective, such as $100 or €100 per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>:
*   **Diversification by Sector**: Academic studies suggest investing in at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Number of Stocks**: It's advisable for an [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | investment portfolio]] to contain between 15 and 20 stocks that meet the profitability objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Focus**: The primary focus should be on the dividends the company will pay in the future, rather than the daily fluctuations of the stock market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Finding Dividend Stocks

Free tools can assist in identifying suitable dividend stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Investing.com Stock Screener**:
    *   Navigate to the "Tool" section and select "Stock Screener" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
    *   **Dividend Yield Filter**: Set the dividend yield filter between 6% and 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Yields above 10% are often unsustainable, and yields below 6% might require significantly more capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
    *   **Dividend Growth Filter**: Limit historical dividend growth between 0% and 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This ensures companies haven't reduced dividends but also aren't aggressively growing them to an unsustainable degree <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
    *   This filter can be applied to different countries and regions to find relevant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

## Calculating Required Capital for Income Target

To achieve an average daily profitability target of $100 or €100 (equivalent to $3,000/month or $36,000/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>:
*   **Realistic Dividend Yield**: A realistic objective for a portfolio's average dividend yield is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Formula**:
    *   Divide 1 by the expected portfolio profitability (e.g., 7% or 0.07) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
    *   Multiply the result by the annual income target.
    *   Example: For a 7% average yield and $36,000 annual target: (1 / 0.07) = ~14.28. Then, $36,000 * 14.28 = ~$504,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Variables**: The required capital depends on the desired daily performance and the portfolio's capacity to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Lowering the daily target (e.g., to $50) would halve the required capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

*   **Collection**: Companies automatically send dividend payments to your third-party broker account where shares are deposited. Payments can be monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Taxation**:
    *   Dividends are generally taxed between 20% and 25% in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
    *   **Withholding Tax (Double Taxation)**: Receiving dividends from outside your country of tax residence can lead to a "withholding tax," or double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
    *   **Avoiding Double Taxation in the US**: In the United States, the W8BN form can be filled out (often with a simple click via brokers like Interactive Brokers) to avoid this double taxation, ensuring the full dividend amount is received <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

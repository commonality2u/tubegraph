The economy is currently weakening and could be entering a [[economic_recession | recession]] according to investor Bill Ackman. He predicts that the Federal Reserve (Fed) will take action by lowering interest rates, which could stimulate the economy and benefit the [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This expected shift in trend is anticipated to reverse downward pressure on various stocks and sectors experienced over the past two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Track Record
Bill Ackman has demonstrated an accurate vision of the macroeconomy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.
*   **COVID-19 Pandemic** He made 2.6 trillion in profit by predicting a significant drop in interest rates and market panic during COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.
*   **Inflation Crisis** He warned of the inflation crisis experienced over the past two years and benefited from it through swaps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Current Prediction** He has recently invested in anticipation of lower interest rates and a possible [[economic_recession | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Ackman believes the next three months will be the most complicated for the economy before a reversal occurs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

## Signs of a Weakening Economy
Ackman notes a weakening economy, with signs observed in companies he invests in, as well as in transportation, real estate, materials, and industrial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.
*   **Europe** Italy is on the verge of [[economic_recession | recession]], Germany was already in [[economic_recession | recession]], and the United Kingdom also <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Spain's growth is slowing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
*   **United States** There is a very large slowdown taking place according to recent data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
*   **Debt and Credit** Companies took on significant debt when interest rates were low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. As this debt matures for renewal in a high-interest rate environment, it can cause a cascading effect, leading companies to stop investing and lay off employees to manage higher debt costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. A contraction of credit, a rare historical event, is currently occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. Asking for credit is described as being under the most difficult conditions in the last 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### The Role of Inflation
The current crisis differs from those of the last 20-30 years because it is caused by inflation, which has not been a factor for a long time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Moderating inflation allows for lower interest rates, which can be very positive for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. This scenario, where economies experience very low growth but the market is bullish, has occurred historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Key [[Macroeconomic Indicators and Their Implications | Macroeconomic Indicators]]
*   **Advanced Economic Indicators** A graph of advanced [[macroeconomic_indicators_and_their_implications | economic indicators]] shows that a line crossing below zero has predicted every [[economic_recession | recession]] 100% of the time, indicating high reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. As of October 2023, these indicators are at levels similar to those prior to previous [[economic_recession | economic recessions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Increases** Historically, [[economic_recession | economic crises]] tend to coincide with the final interest rate increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. Central banks often realize they've gone too far after a period of prolonged increases and pause for about 6 months before reversing and lowering rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>. This pattern appears to be occurring now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.
*   **Real Interest Rate** The real interest rate (Fed's interest rate minus inflation) is currently very high at 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. This discourages investment in real businesses, as people prefer risk-free financial investments like treasury bills yielding 5.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a>. A high positive real rate acts like a "vacuum cleaner," drawing money from the real economy towards financial assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:52">[01:10:52]</a>. Lowering the real interest rate is necessary to encourage investment in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:27">[01:11:27]</a>.
*   **Inflation Data (Germany)** Monthly inflation data from Germany is already negative at -0.4%, potentially indicating 5% deflation if sustained for 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. The CPI for the previous 12 months was 3.2%, better than the expected 3.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:04">[01:12:04]</a>.
*   **Labor Market** Bottlenecks in supplies have been resolved, and the labor market is normalizing, reducing wage inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:55">[01:14:55]</a>.
*   **Atlanta Fed Forecasts** The Atlanta Fed's advance data for U.S. economic growth in the current quarter is only 1.2%, significantly lower than the usual 2.5-3% growth, with forecasts dropping from 2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:55">[01:15:55]</a>. It could approach zero or become negative by month-end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:21">[01:16:21]</a>.

## Impact of Interest Rate Cuts on Markets
When interest rates are lowered decisively, especially the "First Rate Cut," it is quite bullish for the [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. Lower financing costs encourage investment, boost optimism, and generate a new economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This is why "bad economic news" for the real economy can be "good news" for the markets in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

> [!TIP] **Market Psychology**
> The [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] performs best when economic conditions are positive (interest rate cuts or low rates) and the real economy is not in hyper-growth but also not in a very serious [[economic_recession | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:14">[01:13:14]</a>. Large increases often occur suddenly as markets shift from fear to eagerness to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:57">[01:13:57]</a>. Currently, a lot of money is "parked in liquidity" in funds, reflecting a significant level of fear, though not at 2008 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:04">[01:14:04]</a>.

Ackman believes the first interest rate cuts will occur in the first quarter of 2024, much sooner than many people expect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. He has closed his short positions betting on rising interest rates and now thinks the opposite will happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:55">[01:16:55]</a>.

### Elections and Interest Rates
It is questioned whether the Fed and [[central_bank_forecasts_and_economic_recession | central banks]] might lower rates before the 2024 elections, which could be seen as a political move to help the incumbent party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:46">[01:07:46]</a>. Ackman believes rates will go down regardless of elections and sooner than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:24">[01:08:24]</a>. Historically, the [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] performs very well in election years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:43">[01:08:43]</a>. Politicians desire a good economy and [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] performance to win votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Stock Market vs. Economy**
> The [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] is not always correlated with the real economy in the short to medium term. For example, the DAX (German stock index) is at historic highs despite Germany being in a [[economic_recession | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>. The market tends to anticipate future conditions, buying in advance of expected improvements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>.

## Sectors Penalized by High Interest Rates
Five types of investments have been heavily penalized over the past 1-2 years since [[central_bank_forecasts_and_economic_recession | central banks]] aggressively raised interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
1.  **REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)** Highly sensitive to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:22">[01:23:22]</a>.
2.  **Small Caps** Historically, periods of flat performance for small caps often precede very large increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:30">[01:27:30]</a>. Valuations are currently very low (11-13 times earnings) compared to their normal range (around 18 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:03">[01:28:03]</a>.
3.  **Fixed Income** The value of bonds dropped significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:04">[01:24:04]</a>.
4.  **Dividend Stocks** Move inversely to interest rates; as bond yields rise, dividend stock prices fall to adjust their yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:24">[01:24:24]</a>.
5.  **Cyclical Stocks & High-Debt Companies** Cyclical stocks (e.g., construction, auto, retail, transportation, airlines) are sensitive to the economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>. Companies with high debt, even if their income is predictable, have been penalized due to increased interest payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:54">[01:25:54]</a>. The market overreacts to the impact of higher debt costs on profits, leading to disproportionate stock price drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.

### Examples of Affected Companies
*   **Altria (MO)** Offers a very high dividend yield of 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:01">[01:35:01]</a>, historically 6% when bond yields were lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:03">[01:35:03]</a>. Despite growing operating profit and increasing dividends per share, the stock price is at the same level as 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:45">[01:37:45]</a>. Its P/E ratio has dropped from 20 to 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:21">[01:39:21]</a>.
*   **IWG (IWG)** (formerly Regus) A small-cap, real estate sector company based in the UK, penalized by [[economic_recession | recession]] fears and high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:16">[01:40:16]</a>. Its share price collapsed by 65% despite invoicing and earning similarly to pre-2020 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>. It reported its highest revenue in 34 years in the past year, with 24% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:47">[01:45:47]</a>. The company is shifting to a "capital light" model, managing office spaces for a percentage of income, allowing for rapid expansion without significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.
*   **Berry Global (BERY)** A leveraged company manufacturing packaging for consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. Despite doubling profits over 5 years, the stock is at the same level as 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:34">[01:54:34]</a>. Its P/E ratio is around 8, while similar companies in the private market trade at 12-15 times EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:04">[01:59:04]</a>.
*   **Telus International (TIXT)** A services company with customer concentration (Google, Facebook), whose valuation has dropped to 7 times earnings from 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:04">[01:30:04]</a>. Growth slowed, and margins were compressed due to clients cutting costs, but analysts expect recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:30">[01:30:30]</a>.
*   **Catalana Occidente (GCO)** A Spanish insurer, categorized as a small-medium company, has suffered for the same reasons as others in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:18">[02:20:18]</a>. Its earnings per share have doubled since 2018, but the stock has not performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. Its valuation is at 6.6 times earnings, near decade lows, compared to a historical average of 12 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:04">[02:23:04]</a>.

## Investment Outlook
The current environment presents significant opportunities, with companies that have strong fundamentals and growth trading at historically low valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>. Investors should focus on the long-term fundamentals of a business, as the [[stock_market_and_economic_recession_history | stock market]] will eventually recognize good performance, despite short-term [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | volatility]] (1-3 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a>. This requires patience and a deep [[understanding_market_cycles_and_economic_indicators | understanding of market cycles and economic indicators]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:56">[01:41:56]</a>.

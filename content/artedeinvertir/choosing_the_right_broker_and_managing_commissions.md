When starting to invest in the stock market, choosing the appropriate broker is a crucial first step. While the world of investing offers many opportunities, it can also be confusing for newcomers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Having the right attitude, which includes hard work, effort, and courage, is essential to navigate difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Why Choose a Specific Broker?

A common mistake for new investors is opening a securities account with their regular bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>. The primary business of traditional banks is not acting as a stock broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Consequently, they tend to charge very high commissions and offer poor service compared to specialized brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. Specialized brokers are more prepared to handle stock market operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

## Key Factors in Broker Selection

Several factors should be considered when [[choosing_a_broker_for_investments | selecting a broker]]:
*   **Commissions**: The fees charged per transaction are a primary concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. High commissions, especially for small accounts, can significantly reduce potential profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. For instance, some brokers might charge €10-€20 per international operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Service and Support**: Evaluate the level of service provided, including customer support in your language <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Often, lower commissions might mean less direct support, possibly limited to chat or phone, without a physical office presence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Ownership of Shares**: Ensure that the broker allows you to own physical shares, rather than derivatives like CFDs (Contracts For Difference), which can be riskier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>.
*   **Geographical Breadth**: A broker offering access to various markets (e.g., US, Canadian, UK) provides more [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | investment opportunities]] than one limited to a single market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. The New York Stock Exchange, for example, lists around 10,000 shares, compared to approximately 200 in the Spanish market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.

### Recommended Broker

For those starting out, especially with smaller accounts, an online broker like Interactive Brokers is recommended due to its low commissions, allowing trades from as little as one dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. While it may lack physical offices, it's a good starting point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## Starting Capital and Commissions

It is recommended to start investing with a minimum of €5,000 to €10,000 to adequately cover commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. For individuals with less capital, starting with [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment funds]] is a good alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Investment funds allow purchasing exposure to multiple shares at once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. For those with even less than €10,000, the only option is to save diligently until sufficient capital is accumulated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Managing Your Portfolio and Learning

Once a securities account is established and initial knowledge gained, the next step is [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | building the portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### Starting with Blue Chips
It's advisable to begin by investing in "blue chip" stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. These are typically large, well-known, and high-quality companies (e.g., IBM, McDonald's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. Investing in blue chips helps gain confidence and minimizes the cost of early mistakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Building Your Portfolio
Initially, consider diversifying across approximately 40 securities. This approach might not generate extremely high annual returns (e.g., 25-30%), but it provides a safer start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. As experience grows and control over investments increases, investors can reduce the number of securities and focus on smaller, potentially higher-return companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>.

### Simulated Accounts
Before investing real money, using simulated accounts on platforms like Google Finance or provided by brokers is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>. These virtual portfolios allow users to practice trading, factor in commissions, and experience market variations without financial risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. This helps acclimatize the brain to potential fluctuations, as a €50,000 account can vary by 2% (€1,000) in a single day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. While paper losses aren't real, understanding their psychological impact is crucial for [[patience_and_decisionmaking_in_investing | managing emotions]] in live trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.

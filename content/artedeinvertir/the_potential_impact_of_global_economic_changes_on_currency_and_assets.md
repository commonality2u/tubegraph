Renowned economist and investor Ray Dalio predicts a significant global economic shift that will impact everyone, regardless of their [[stock_market_volatility_and_the_impact_of_global_events | stock market]] investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This new [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | economic scenario]] is expected to be the most substantial change in society and the economy in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. These changes will have serious implications for the value of currencies like the dollar and the euro, real estate, and will affect [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Credibility and Warnings

Ray Dalio is recognized as one of the most influential figures in the economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He manages the world's largest investment fund, Bridgewater, overseeing over $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. The assets he manages exceed the gross domestic product of some countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Over the years, Dalio has demonstrated high reliability in predicting major [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | economic changes]], successfully protecting his investment portfolios from significant crises such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2000 technological bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Having become a multimillionaire, Dalio has made his research on the economy public, notably through his book "The New World Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. He has consistently warned society to adapt to this new economic reality to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Three Intersecting Problems Leading to Change

In a recent interview, Ray Dalio outlined three major problems converging that will trigger these economic changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>:

### 1. Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle
Dalio identifies a monetary problem and a [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | debt cycle]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This is coupled with a recession and significant social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. He notes that [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inequality between classes]] is fueling the rise of populist parties, which he believes will negatively affect economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

For example, 90% of the American population owns increasingly less wealth, while a mere 10% holds 75% of the wealth in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this issue, as governments issued substantial debt to save the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This debt will eventually be paid through taxes from the working class, who have not benefited from recent economic booms in housing, [[stock_market_volatility_and_the_impact_of_global_events | stock market]] investments, or currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### 2. Decline of US Competitive Advantage
The second problem is the United States losing its competitive edge to China, which will have serious consequences for the West's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Dalio describes the US as a 75-year-old empire showing clear signs of decline, currently in a terminal phase of the credit cycle due to excessive debt production and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

Historically, the US could issue debt and print new dollars without collapsing its currency's value, given its global economic dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in GDP and global relevance in military, technological innovation, and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In past crises, printing new dollars was the solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. However, in the next crisis, if people lose confidence in the dollar, this "recipe" may no longer work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

In 2020, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed, a massive increase for a currency with a 200-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. China is expected to surpass the US in GDP around 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>.

> "Looking ahead in five years we could see a situation where foreigners who have been lending money to the United States stop doing so and the dollar will no longer be accepted as easily around the world for making purchases" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>.
> "We have been spending more money than we earned when difficult times come society will fight among itself the poor will want more money from the rich and rich people will try to protect their money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

Dalio warns that the world will change significantly in the next five years, necessitating immediate action to protect savings and [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### The Rise and Decline Cycle
Ray Dalio's research suggests that economies follow two fundamental phases: rise and decline, each defined by specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. His chart indicates the US is entering the decline phase, characterized by high debt and alarming money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Conversely, China is in the ascending phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Advice

To protect savings and [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investments]] and capitalize on future opportunities, Dalio offers key advice:

### 1. Avoid Liquidity
Dalio emphasizes the need to worry about the value of money itself, just as one worries about [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. With extensive money printing, [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] reduces purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This forces individuals to become [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investors]] in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### 2. Diversify Well
Diversification is crucial, encompassing different countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The goal is for one asset to rise when another falls, maintaining portfolio value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Dalio's "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory advocates for a portfolio prepared for both good and bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>. He recommends the following asset allocation:

*   **Stocks (40%):** In the current [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | economic environment]], characterized by high but expected to drop [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]], [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | emerging market stocks]] perform best, followed by small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   Dalio's portfolio includes three of his five main [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investments]] as ETFs related to [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | emerging market stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Investing in these ETFs allows benefiting from a basket of stocks representing multiple [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | emerging countries]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   **Small-cap stocks** also perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Due to liquidity issues for large investors like Dalio, ETFs related to small caps, such as the Russell 2000 index ETF (WM), are an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Historically, these stocks have yielded over 17% annually in similar economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Small-cap stocks offer greater growth potential and are often less followed by the market, potentially making them undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>.

*   **Gold (Small percentage, never exceeding 10%):** While gold is a traditional safe haven, in the current scenario it shows one of the worst performances, contrary to popular belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. However, Dalio still recommends holding a small percentage of gold through ETFs related to gold mining companies or physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

*   **Bonds (Never exceeding 40%):** Dalio recommends including bonds, especially those protected against [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]], as a defensive component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. These tend to perform well when other [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes | investments]], like stocks, decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Currently, there is a "bubble" in the bond market due to extensive money printing by governments, leading Dalio to apply a more conservative asset allocation to this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

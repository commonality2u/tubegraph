Many experts believe that inflation is worsening and could lead to a crisis, with figures like [[Ray Dalio | Ray Dalio]] and Michael Burry issuing warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This article examines the current inflationary environment and identifies potential [[investment opportunities during inflation | investment opportunities]] and strategies to navigate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Understanding the Current Inflationary Environment

Inflation, specifically "transitory inflation," has recently surged, similar to the rebound seen after the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

### Contributing Factors to Inflation
*   **Chip Shortage:** Intel announced on October 21st that the chip shortage will likely persist until 2023, extending inflationary pressures into 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This shortage severely impacts manufacturers, particularly in the automotive industry, leading to increased demand and prices for used vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Building a new microchip factory takes 18 to 24 months, with increased demand from digitalization and remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Factories started being built in late 2020/early 2021, meaning production might not begin until late 2022 or early 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.
*   **Persistent Inflation Concerns:** While some expected semiconductor-driven [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] to normalize by May or June, it is now predicted to extend until the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. This could lead to the "persistent inflation" that many experts warn about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Balance Sheets:** The expansion of central bank balance sheets since 2009, particularly through quantitative easing, has driven up market valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. For instance, the total sum of all central bank balance sheets increased fourfold from 2009, mirroring the S&P 500's fourfold increase from 1,000 to 4,500 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. [[Ray Dalio | Ray Dalio]] warns that if central banks stop injecting money, the market could experience more modest behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

### Impacts of Inflation on Investments
*   **Social Inequality:** Inflation disproportionately affects poorer classes by reducing disposable income, while benefiting those with financial assets, potentially leading to social inequality and populist movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Negative Real Returns:** A key indicator of a potential stock market bubble or correction is negative real returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. With the S&P 500's implied profitability at 5% and inflation rebounding to 5.5%, real profitability turns negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Historically, periods of negative real profitability have preceded difficult market conditions, including crises in the 1970s, 1982, the dot-com bubble, and the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Crowded Trades:** When inflation is a widely discussed "fashionable topic" (mentioned seven times more often in conference calls than in 2000-2006) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>, its [[inflation_expectations_and_their_impact_on_investments | impact]] is likely already priced into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Crises usually occur due to unforeseen issues, not those everyone is focused on <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_during_inflation | Investment Strategies During Inflation]]

### Sectors That Perform Well
In inflationary periods, especially September and October, energy companies, banks, and raw materials companies have performed exceptionally well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Divergent Views
Kathy Wood suggests that deflation or a drop in prices might begin to appear after the Christmas holidays in early 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>. She argues that technological stocks with high growth often perform best when inflation is low or during periods of punctual deflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

### Market Positioning and Liquidity
Monitoring market liquidity is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>. High cash levels in investment funds, especially above 5% of average liquidity, have historically preceded market rallies, as investors eventually need to deploy that capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>.

### Valuations
While some parts of the market, particularly the top 10 S&P 500 stocks (e.g., Tesla, Nvidia, Amazon), show very high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:18">[00:18:18]</a>, the S&P 500 excluding these top stocks trades at approximately 16 times earnings, which is its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:05">[00:19:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>. This suggests the broader market may not be as expensive as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.

## [[examples_of_businesses_that_perform_well_in_inflationary_periods | Companies to Consider in an Inflationary Environment]]

When evaluating companies, especially in an inflationary environment, it's important to analyze their financial strength, pricing power, and ability to generate profits.

### Google (Alphabet)
Google's Q3 results were described as "spectacular," with earnings per share almost doubling year-over-year, rising 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>.
*   **Growth Drivers:** YouTube is growing significantly (around 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>. The company overall is growing above 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>. Google Cloud's losses are being minimized, moving from a $1.2 billion loss to $600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:20">[00:28:20]</a>.
*   **Operating Leverage:** The cloud business has high fixed costs, so as revenues increase, profits skyrocket because costs remain relatively stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>. This means even if Google grows revenue by 20%, profits could grow 25-30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks:** Google has accelerated share buybacks, even at historical highs, indicating management's confidence in future profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. They invested only $6 billion of $25 billion generated this quarter, freeing up $20 billion for buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:58">[00:29:58]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Google is considered reasonably valued at around 30 times earnings for its quality and growth, with a potential target price of $9,000 per share by 2025, assuming 15-20% profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:34">[00:32:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:32">[00:33:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:44">[00:34:44]</a>.

### Microsoft
Microsoft's results have also been spectacular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:53">[00:43:53]</a>.
*   **Growth and Profitability:** Revenue grew 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>, operating profit increased by 42%, and earnings per share by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:47">[00:44:47]</a>. The cloud segment is growing at 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power ("Price in Power"):** Companies like Microsoft can raise prices (e.g., 20% price increase for Microsoft Office starting March 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:22">[00:46:22]</a>. This directly boosts earnings per share as costs remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:04">[00:45:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:08">[00:45:08]</a>. This "operating leverage" allows a small price increase to lead to a significant rise in profit margins (e.g., from 40% to 60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:05">[00:47:05]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook:** Microsoft could have a spectacular year, potentially earning $12 per share, leading to a target price of $400-$450 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:21">[00:48:21]</a>. In a conservative scenario, it could still double in price over the next four years, offering an 18% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:02">[00:49:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:16">[00:49:16]</a>.

### Visa
Visa is a predictable business with consistent growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a>.
*   **Market Position:** As an oligopoly in payment processing, with no significant alternatives, Visa can progressively raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:39">[00:57:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:41">[00:57:41]</a>.
*   **Growth Drivers:** Global cash payments still account for 60%, indicating substantial room for electronic payment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:22">[00:57:22]</a>. Visa grows 7-8% via volume and another 5% annually via price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>.
*   **Profit Expansion:** Similar to Microsoft, as growth comes from price increases, profit margins expand, leading to earnings per share growth exceeding 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:04">[00:58:04]</a>.
*   **Capital Allocation:** Visa returns all earnings to shareholders through share buybacks, further boosting earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>. Its EPS can grow 15-20% easily in the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:24">[00:58:24]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Visa's expected earnings for 2022 are around $8, and it's projected to earn $14 by 2025, offering a conservative valuation target of $420 at 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:18">[00:59:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

### Real Estate (Logistics REITs: VGP, Argan)
The logistics real estate sector is experiencing significant growth due to the rise of e-commerce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>.
*   **VGP:** This company develops and rents logistics and semi-industrial real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:44">[01:17:44]</a>. Its net asset value has grown spectacularly from $30 to $90 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:01">[01:19:01]</a>. It has a low debt level of 30% relative to net property value, making it conservative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:17">[01:23:17]</a>. VGP's new logistics buildings are, on average, four years old and occupied at 99%, indicating extremely high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:07">[01:21:07]</a>. The company has secured fixed-rate debt at 1.5% until 2029, while properties yield 4.5% profitability, a very profitable spread that also protects against high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:26">[01:25:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:31">[01:25:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:36">[01:25:36]</a>.
*   **Argan:** Similar to VGP, Argan designs, builds, develops, and rents logistics platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:07">[01:26:07]</a>. Its cash flow has grown from $30 million to almost $120 million in eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>. It also benefits from a conservative debt-to-value ratio of 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:14">[01:27:14]</a>.

### Other Companies Mentioned
*   **Lockheed Martin:** Despite reducing its guidance, the company has a strong balance sheet and plans to use it for share buybacks, even taking on debt to do so, at attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>.
*   **Davita:** A healthcare company that is "quite cheap" and has seen its earnings per share grow significantly (from $3 to $9) since 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:03">[01:04:03]</a>. Its valuation is currently at historical lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Embracer Group:** A video game holding company that diversifies risk by acquiring multiple video game franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:15">[01:50:15]</a>. It has a good business model, with estimated earnings of $5, trading at a reasonable multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:26">[01:51:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.

> [!INFO] Importance of Portfolio Management
> It is crucial to manage a diversified portfolio rather than just individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:50">[01:10:50]</a>. A well-managed portfolio with companies that have good valuations, low risk, and strong returns will likely yield positive overall results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a>.

> [!TIP] Contrarian Thinking
> In the stock market, crises often occur for reasons that most people are *not* worried about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:32">[01:22:32]</a>. It's beneficial to have a divergent vision from the market consensus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>. For example, while everyone is focused on inflation, the real risk might lie elsewhere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:29">[01:42:29]</a>.

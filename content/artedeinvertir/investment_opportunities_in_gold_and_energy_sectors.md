The "new world economic order" is expected to be one of the largest economic and social reforms in recent decades, with serious implications for both the stock market and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. Renowned investor Ray Dalio warns this new scenario could lead to a major crisis in the US and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Economic Outlook
Ray Dalio, known as the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" for his accurate predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, observes a "great cycle" in which a new world order began in 1945 after World War II, establishing the dollar as a world reserve currency and a dominant power leading to a period of peace and prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This is now "about to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Political extremism in the US is expected to accelerate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

According to Dalio's analysis, the US is entering a phase of economic decline, characterized by high debt levels and alarming quantities of money printing, leading to economic and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Conversely, China is in an upward phase, creating wealth and accumulating debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. The extensive printing of money, seen since the 2008 financial crisis (the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew from $1 trillion to over $7 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>, is causing significant inflation and increases in raw material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

This situation leads to severe economic consequences:
*   **Rising Taxes:** Taxes are expected to increase globally, negatively affecting the stock market by decreasing company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Worsening Economic Conditions:** The Federal Reserve has signaled future interest rate hikes, which could negatively impact highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Regulation:** New regulations and wealth redistribution measures would negatively affect most [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Volatile Conditions
In such an inflationary environment, the value of money decreases, making it crucial to remain invested, but in the "correct [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:30:00">[06:30:00]</a>. Ray Dalio's investment philosophy suggests having at least 40% of an investment portfolio in stocks, as they tend to perform well in this new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in the Energy Sector
A study by Bank of America covering 50 years of the stock market indicates that in a scenario of rising inflation, the **energy sector** is expected to be the top performer, followed by the raw materials sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.

### Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)
*   **Description:** One of Canada's largest producers of oil and energy, listed on the US stock exchange under the ticker CNQ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. It produces over one million barrels of oil daily from high-quality lands with low extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>.
*   **Performance & Valuation:** Over the last five years, its stock has performed sideways due to the sector not being in fashion and low inflation, leading to an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
*   **Dividends:** The company has an excellent track record of increasing dividends for the past 20 years, including during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.
*   **Current Metrics:** Currently trades at a valuation of only four times its EBITDA, whereas the historical average for the energy sector is around six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. At its current price of $32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>, if it traded at its historical average EBITDA, its value would be around $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   **Potential Upside:** If Ray Dalio's scenario materializes, increased inflation would boost the company's profits and increase the multiples investors are willing to pay for this sector, potentially raising the intrinsic value above $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:00">[08:44:00]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Gold
Ray Dalio states that gold is an [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_bonds | investment]] that will perform well if the new world order materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>. He recommends allocating at least 10% of a portfolio to gold [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_bonds | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>. The printing of money consistently decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth towards financial assets, historically raising the price of gold and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>. Since March 2020, gold has risen from $1,500 to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>.

### Ways to Invest in Gold
There are two main ways to invest in gold:

1.  **Gold ETFs:**
    *   **GLD:** The largest gold ETF globally, listed on the stock exchange under the ticker GLD at a price of $169 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>. It has shown excellent performance as money creation accelerated over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>.
    *   **iShares (GN):** A European version for investors who cannot buy American gold ETFs, trading under the ticker GN at a price of 30 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:20:00">[10:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Gold Mining Companies:** This option is more complex due to operational risks (e.g., floods, landslides, strikes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. However, if they perform well and gold prices rise, these [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] could see much greater increases than the price of gold itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. To reduce individual operational risk, one can invest in an ETF representing a group of gold mining companies.
    *   **GDX:** The largest ETF representing gold mining companies in the US is listed under the ticker GDX, trading at a price of $34 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

## Other Considerations
Ray Dalio identifies government bankruptcy after economic shocks, coupled with high economic inequalities and class differences, as the "single most important advanced indicator of wars and revolutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a>. This risk, though not immediate, could lead to severe consequences if the economy continues its current direction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

An example of a stock that could perform well in such a scenario is Axon Enterprise Inc. (AXON), which manufactures personal defense products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Listed under the ticker AXON at $75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>, its shares have appreciated from $6 to over $75 since 2008 due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. It trades at an attractive valuation of 11 times this year's earnings, compared to its historical average of 16 times, suggesting a potential realization of over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>. If Ray Dalio's scenario materializes, its potential could be significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

[[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest and most powerful individuals, has recently issued warnings about a new threat that he believes could endanger the world and the [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets | global economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. He has described this potential risk as being worse than the recent crisis experienced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## [[bill_gates_role_in_pandemic_prediction_and_preparation | Bill Gates]]' History of Warnings and Predictions

[[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] played a significant role during the 2019 crisis, having warned in advance that a similar situation could occur, though his warnings went unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He also accurately predicted how that crisis might be resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. His investment acumen is notable, as he invested in the early stages of companies like Novavax and BioNTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. Furthermore, he predicted that Pfizer, along with BioNTech, would be the first to develop a solution to the "current problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Having founded Microsoft at a young age, [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] has become one of the world's richest individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Notably, Microsoft shares currently represent only 2% of his total assets, as he has diversified much of his wealth into other sectors and publicly traded shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. His deep knowledge of various economic sectors, particularly technology, has led to a high success rate in his investments, making his movements closely monitored by global investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Identification of New Threats

During the annual security conference in Munich, [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] was asked about the factors that concerned him most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:09">[01:53:09]</a>. He stated, "It is certain that we will have another pandemic in the future, only this time it will be with a different pathogen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.

In a separate interview with CNBC, [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] provided additional insights into his concerns:
*   He believes "we have not yet seen the worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:09">[03:05:09]</a>.
*   He is concerned about people's distrust in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:09">[03:07:09]</a>.
*   For a future crisis, he stressed the need to act in less than six months instead of two years, which necessitates trust in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:09">[03:11:09]</a>.
*   He suggested that social networks require regulation due to their role in creating division within society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:09">[03:18:09]</a>.

He also expressed significant concern about potential terrorist attacks involving smallpox strains that could be massively disseminated in public places such as airports, stadiums, or shopping centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:09">[11:36:09]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Response to Risks

[[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] has begun to act decisively in the face of these identified risks for his investments and the [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets | global economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>. Public records, due to U.S. stock market transparency rules for investors with over $100 million, show that he has rapidly sold shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>, initiating the sale of 12 out of 18 shares in his portfolio without purchasing any new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:09">[02:39:09]</a>.

His capital movements highlight three key factors:

### Sale of Cyclical and Technology Stocks
*   **Cyclical Companies:** He has focused on selling shares in cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>. These shares are highly sensitive to the [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets | economic cycle]] and tend to fall sharply when economic problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:09">[03:51:09]</a>.
*   **Technology Companies:** He sold all his Google shares, one of the few technology companies he retained <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:09">[04:00:09]</a>. The Nasdaq technology index plummeted over 30% in the first five months alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:28:09">[04:28:09]</a>. His only remaining technology holding is Microsoft, representing barely 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:09">[04:14:09]</a>. He also divested from all his Alibaba shares just before their significant decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:09">[04:52:09]</a>.
*   **Transportation Sector:** He sold shares related to the transportation sector, including UPS and FedEx, two of the largest global transport companies, and Canadian Pacific Railway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:09">[05:11:09]</a>.
*   **Betting Against Tesla:** [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] has started betting against Tesla shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:09">[05:43:09]</a>. One potential reason for this decision is the high valuation Tesla shares reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:09">[06:37:09]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of not confusing a good company with a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:09">[06:42:09]</a>.

### Retention of Defensive Stocks and Assets
Despite anticipating potential future economic problems, [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] recognizes the need to remain invested to counter [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] and preserve purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:09">[07:29:09]</a>. The few stocks he has retained are from predictable and defensive sectors, which are least affected during an [[current_economic_risks_for_the_stock_market | economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:09">[07:38:09]</a>:
*   **Ecolab (ECL):** This company focuses on water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection products and services for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:09">[08:05:09]</a>. Its competitive advantage stems from reputation and long-standing operations, making it resistant to new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:09">[08:25:09]</a>. The company has consistently increased its earnings per share, performing well during crises like 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:09">[08:47:09]</a>. It is expected to benefit from new regulations regarding water treatment and environmental respect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:09">[09:15:09]</a>.
*   **Waste Management (WM):** As the leading garbage collection company in the United States, it operates in a predictable, traditional, and crisis-resistant sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:09">[10:15:09]</a>. The trend towards waste recycling and environmental respect is expected to benefit the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:09">[10:29:09]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola FEMSA:** This is the national bottler of Coca-Cola for Mexico, another highly defensive and predictable business aligning with his conservative stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:09">[12:43:09]</a>.
*   **Farmland:** Outside the stock market, [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] has significantly accumulated farmland, becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:09">[13:01:09]</a>. This move proved successful just before the recent rise in food prices and [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:09:09">[13:09:09]</a>.

## Call for Global Preparedness

[[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] has begun advocating for governments to establish a new common fund of over $1 billion annually. This fund would be dedicated to the control and monitoring of the new risks he has identified, which he believes could have severe effects on society and the [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets | global economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:52:09">[11:52:09]</a>.

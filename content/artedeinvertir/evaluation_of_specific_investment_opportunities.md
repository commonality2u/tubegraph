This article, based on a live stream from "The Art of Investing," explores how to evaluate [[analysis_of_specific_stocks_and_market_opportunities | specific stocks and market opportunities]], particularly in the context of preparing for economic crises, drawing heavily on the advice of Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. The discussion emphasizes common-sense tips that are easily replicable by retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## Market Situation and Volatility

While the exact day of a crisis is unknown, its eventual occurrence is very likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Historical data indicates that drops of over 10% are probable every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. In 2021, the biggest drop experienced was only 4%, reaching 12% from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This suggests that short-to-medium term relapses of 8-10% or more are likely, historically providing opportunities to buy good, cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. A drop of at least 20% in the market is expected in the next two to three years, with many stocks potentially falling much more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Volatility, fear, and greed are inherent parts of the [[investment_opportunities in the stock market | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Lately, the market has been in a period of greed, having risen for over 12 months without stopping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Advice for Crisis Preparation

Warren Buffett's warnings include being cautious about inflation, the market's significant rise, and people's euphoria or investment in non-productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. His approach to preparing for recessions and crises involves five key tips:

### 1. Maintain Liquidity
Buffett prefers to have high levels of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He doesn't bet against the market due to high opportunity costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Historically, before the 2008 crisis (2005-2007), he maintained very high liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. When the crisis hit in 2009, he significantly lowered liquidity to make investments at "knockdown prices," which have since multiplied by 35 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Since 2015, he has again accumulated a lot of liquidity, currently holding $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. This provides an advantage for good acquisitions during market falls and protects Berkshire Hathaway shares in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### 2. Avoid Using Debt
Buffett advises against using debt, both at the company and personal investment level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>
> He does not like to invest in companies with a lot of debt, particularly long-term debt, because long-term debt increases interest rates, it can drastically reduce profits and future cases of the company, making them less predictable.

This was a reason for selling airline stocks, as they would emerge from the crisis with significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Investors should avoid using debt, especially when the market has risen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The ideal time to use debt is when the market has fallen and stocks are cheap, as this reduces risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Currently, margin debt levels are at record highs, indicating that people are borrowing to buy at historical market highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This leads to forced selling and significant losses when the market corrects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### 3. Buy Productive Assets
To prepare for a crisis, one should always buy "productive assets" – things that generate income, dividends, or enable share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Non-productive assets, such as gold or speculative stocks that don't produce profits (e.g., Nicola), or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, depend solely on someone else paying more for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.# Evaluation of Specific Investment Opportunities

When the crisis hit in 2009, he significantly lowered liquidity to make [[analysis_of_anticrisis_investment_opportunities | investments at knockdown prices]], which have since multiplied by 35 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Since 2015, he has again accumulated a lot of liquidity, currently holding $150 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### 3. Buy Productive Assets
To prepare for a crisis, one should always buy "productive assets" – things that generate income, dividends, or enable share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Non-productive assets, such as gold or speculative stocks that don't produce profits (e.g., Nicola), or cryptocurrencies like Bitcoin, depend solely on someone else paying more for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>
> When there's a bull market, non-productive assets, for example many of the speculative stocks that exist now like Nicola that don't produce profits, that is a non-productive asset even if it's a stock. I don't know script or bitcoin coins which are also non-productive assets theoretically in less demand for that kind of investments when things get complicated.

Productive assets, like good stocks that pay dividends or reinvest profits to grow the business, perform much better during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Unprofitable technology companies, considered non-productive assets, showed losing [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investment opportunities]] from 2015-2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. However, due to liquidity injections and speculation, they performed exceptionally well from 2019-2020 (400% return in a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Investing in non-productive companies is generally a losing [[investment_opportunities in the stock market | investment]] in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Speculating in such stocks requires understanding and analysis, but investing is generally easier for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### 4. Buy Quality Stocks at Fair Prices
Buffett advises buying quality stocks of good businesses, typically large, long-listed companies with a consistent upward trend in their historical charts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. The second step is to analyze stocks well to avoid overpaying for quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>. In bull markets, people often overpay for stocks, sometimes 100-300 times earnings or 20-40 times sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:14:03]</a>. This introduces significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

One technique to find quality stocks is to look for "dividend aristocrats" or "dividend kings" – companies that have consistently increased their dividends for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>. While not guaranteeing high annual returns (e.g., above 15%), these stocks offer safety and predictability, suitable for beginners or those wary of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. Examples mentioned as quality stocks include:
*   Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   Moody's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>
*   Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>
*   General Dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>
*   Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>
*   Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>
*   Cisco Systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:39]</a>
*   Sanofi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:45]</a>
*   Colgate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>
*   Exxon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
*   Chevron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   Home Depot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>
*   Union Pacific (rail transport) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:30]</a>
*   Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>
*   Novartis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:20]</a>

Many of these companies have high credit ratings (AA to A+), superior to some countries, indicating strong credit quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:45]</a>.

A quick way to estimate future profitability of a stock is to add the dividend yield to the rate of dividend increase over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:12]</a>. For example, Mastercard has a low initial dividend but grows it at 36% per year, resulting in high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:35]</a>.

### 5. Be Brave During Crises
Once the portfolio is prepared with the right investments and liquidity, investors must be brave to seize opportunities during market crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:02">[00:23:02]</a>. This aligns with Buffett's famous quote:
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>
> Be fearful when others are greedy, and be greedy when others are fearful.

During times of widespread fear (like March-April 2020), stocks are cheapest, risks are lowest, and extraordinary returns can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:32]</a>. Historical data shows that market falls consistently lead to positive future returns, especially over five years (e.g., average 132% return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:25:07]</a>.

## Specific Investment Opportunities and Analysis

### Precia S.A.
Precia is a classic, predictable small-cap stock that Buffett would likely invest in if managing less money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:15">[00:38:18]</a>. It operates in a niche market, manufacturing measuring and weighing devices for production chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:05]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Sells equipment with low initial profit, but earns significant revenue (80-90% margins) from maintenance and calibration systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:12]</a>. Clients value accuracy over cheapness for these critical, one-time purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:08]</a>.
*   **Financials:** No debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:56">[00:40:56]</a>. Income is highly predictable, growing little by little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:18">[00:41:20]</a>. Was unaffected by the 2008 crisis and maintained income in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:34]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Trades at 15 times earnings, significantly lower than comparable companies (40-50 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:15]</a>. Estimated value of 50 euros in the short to medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:43">[00:42:45]</a>, with potential for 70 euros by 2026, delivering 15-16% annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:58">[00:43:15]</a>.
*   **Management:** Management is aligned with shareholder interests, holding significant shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:11">[00:41:12]</a>. The company acquires other businesses and is leveraging current opportunities for acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:54">[00:41:04]</a>.

### Infotel S.A.
Infotel provides computer engineering services and is considered the best in France in its field <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:52]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Similar to Precia, sells computer systems with low initial profit, generating significant revenue from maintenance and updates (80% of income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:20]</a>. This model provides predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:42">[00:46:42]</a>.
*   **Financials:** No debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:54">[00:45:55]</a>. Has a 40-year history of consecutive growth, even during the dot-com bubble and 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:44]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Currently trading at 49 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:26">[00:48:26]</a>. The sector is valued at 9-12 times EBITDA, suggesting a potential value of 70 euros in the next 12 months, and 100 euros by 2026, implying an average annual return of 15% plus dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:05">[00:49:43]</a>.
*   **Management:** Management owns almost 50% of the company's shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:52">[00:46:55]</a> and is open to selling if an interesting price is offered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:52">[00:47:57]</a>.

### IU Group
IU Group acquires and integrates small, excellent companies from founders nearing retirement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:26]</a>. These companies operate in niche industrial markets, offering predictable, repetitive purchases with a maintenance component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:15]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Focused on digital scanning sensors, such as cameras with AI software for factory production lines to detect defects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:07">[00:54:26]</a>. These systems automate processes, eliminate costs, require calibration, and are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:31">[00:54:37]</a>. Niche dominance prevents new competition and allows for higher charges on maintenance services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:49">[00:54:59]</a>.
*   **Recent Benefit:** Benefited from the current crisis due to infrared cameras/thermal sensors that measure temperature, which are in high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:08">[00:55:24]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Currently trades at 180 pence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:27">[00:55:27]</a>. Given its high quality and long-term execution strategy, it is conservatively estimated to make 250 pence in profits in 5-6 years, valuing it at 600 pence (triple its current price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:17]</a>. This represents an average annual return of 22% over five years with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:20">[00:56:27]</a>.

### Other Stock Examples and Considerations

#### Dividend Stocks
*   **Altria:** Has an 8% dividend growth rate over the last ten years and a current yield of 7-8%, suggesting a 16% expected return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:38">[01:07:49]</a>.
*   **Enbridge:** Has increased its dividend by 10% annually on average since 2005, with a current yield of 6%, yielding a 17% expected return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:49">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **AT&T:** Faces challenges from low-cost competitors and limited growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:01">[01:05:06]</a>. Trades at 28, with normalized earnings of $2.80-$3.14 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:21">[01:05:30]</a>. Distributes a dividend of $2, yielding almost 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:10]</a>. Dividend has increased by 1.3% annually on average over the last ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:29]</a>. The market is currently affected by potential mergers and acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:50]</a>.
*   **Philip Morris:** Similar style to Altria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:18">[01:09:20]</a>.
*   **Good Equity Partners (Numinus):** Performed well in recent years, paid good dividends, and is considered a conservative/value stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:24">[01:09:37]</a>.
*   **Total:** French oil company, yields 8-9% and has a history of increasing dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:10">[01:11:15]</a>.

#### Cyclical Stocks
*   **Ford:** Faces production bottlenecks but has strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:08">[01:15:15]</a>. Stock has reached new highs, but Ford is a traditional company that won't grow significantly as it's already global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:35">[01:15:38]</a>. Normal profits are about $1 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:50">[01:15:56]</a>. Typically trades at 8-10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:03">[01:16:05]</a>.
*   **Volkswagen:** Preferred over Ford due to valuable brands like Audi and Porsche, offering more growth and pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:25">[01:15:35]</a>.
*   **Delta Airlines:** Almost recovered from the crisis, but still faces competition from smaller companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:45">[01:18:50]</a>.
*   **Micron:** A cyclical semiconductor company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:23]</a>. After many bankruptcies, three players (Samsung, Sky, Knicks, and Micro) dominate, leading to some price discipline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:04">[01:21:09]</a>.
*   **IAG (International Airlines Group):** Diluted capital significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:44">[01:21:47]</a>. Normalized profits before the crisis were 3 billion, but with almost 4 billion shares, earnings per share are around 0.30-0.40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:51">[01:22:06]</a>. Airplanes typically trade at 5-6 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:02">[01:23:06]</a>. Market has largely discounted its recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:31">[01:23:32]</a>.
*   **Banks (JP Morgan, Citigroup, Credit Suisse):** A somewhat "hated" sector, but Warren Buffett still bets on some, like Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:28">[01:28:34]</a>. Many US banks failed after 2008, leading to consolidation and price discipline among the remaining giants (JP Morgan, Bank of America, Wells Fargo, City) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:57">[01:29:10]</a>. They are considered less cyclical than airlines or auto companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:51">[01:29:55]</a>. Credit Suisse specifically faced issues due to capital files, causing a significant stock drop, but a recovery to prior levels is possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:31:06]</a>.

#### High-Growth/Speculative Stocks
*   **Wish:** E-commerce platform selling low-cost Chinese products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:51">[01:31:55]</a>. Highly competitive market, also competes with Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:09">[01:32:31]</a>. Faces challenges due to changes in international package shipping regulations and not generating benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:37">[01:32:55]</a>.

The global debt has reached record levels following the 2020 crisis, potentially causing significant consequences for both the economy and the [[risks_and_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This situation presents both risks and new [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | opportunities]] for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Global Debt Crisis
Global aid has grown rapidly, reaching alarming levels in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. According to the Institute of International Finance, the total global debt, combining corporate, government, and individual debt, stands at $270 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. In contrast, the global gross domestic product (GDP) is only $80 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This equates to over $35,000 of debt per person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 2020 crisis has exacerbated this, with debt levels reaching new records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has noted that when a government's debt exceeds 77% of its GDP, it can have serious consequences for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Most developed countries, including Spain, Europe, and the USA, have surpassed this limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This record debt coexists with historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A key concern is what will happen when interest rates rise, making this vast debt much more expensive to service for individuals, corporations, and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

### Negative Interest Rates
Unusually, negative interest rates have been observed over the last five years, a phenomenon that has only occurred once in the last 300 years of economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Central banks have exhausted their typical crisis solution of lowering rates, as they have reached zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This "world upside down" scenario means people are paying to lend money; for example, lending to the German government via 10-year bonds with a negative yield of 0.6% annually ensures a loss at maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Despite this, demand for these debt bonds (in dollars and euros) is extremely high, with trillions flowing into the market daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This is due to speculation: if the negative yield becomes even more negative, or if central bank actions cause it, the bond's price on the [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stock market]] can rise, allowing for profit-taking without holding to maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This indicates "stratospheric speculation" in the debt market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The debt market's scale significantly dwarfs the [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stock market]]. In the US alone, the debt market is estimated at $40 trillion, double the $20 trillion [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Daily debt trading volume is around $700 million, compared to $200 billion for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Consequently, events in the debt market will have a major impact on stocks and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Debt with negative interest rates reached a record $17 trillion globally in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

Historically, debt-induced crises are the most severe because credit is the "lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis, tied to sub-prime mortgages, had severe economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, unlike the milder 2000 tech bubble that did not involve extensive debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Expert Warnings
Renowned investor Ray Dalio, who manages the world's largest [[investment_opportunities_and_stock_market_analysis | investment fund]], anticipates significant changes in the global economy over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He has warned that once interest rates reach 0%, asset prices cannot receive an additional boost, rendering traditional economic stimulus tools ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Dalio suggests that the [[risks_and_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] will increasingly influence the economy, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. A fall in the debt market would signal problems to market participants, stopping credit flow and initiating economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

Debt crises are often triggered by aggressive rises in interest rates, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Central banks have recently issued large amounts of new money to finance 2020 crisis problems, which typically causes inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Inflation is a primary variable central banks consider when raising interest rates to balance the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Therefore, future inflation, likely due to money printing, could trigger a fall in the debt market, making inflation monitoring critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Protecting Investments and Capitalizing on the Situation

### Managing Debts
For long-term debts, it is ideal to secure a fixed rate to lock in today's low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If inflation occurs, the value of assets like homes will rise, but fixed-rate debt costs will not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. For short-term debts with high interest rates (e.g., credit cards at 25-30% annually), refinancing into personal loans at much lower rates (e.g., 8-12%) is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Importance of Saving and Liquidity
Saving is crucial for everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When credit flow ceases, liquidity becomes the most valuable asset, enabling [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investments]] at unprecedented prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Investment Strategies
To protect current investments or benefit from the new situation:
*   **Avoid highly indebted companies**: If interest rates rise, these companies will face increased costs and could go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Cyclical businesses like banks, construction companies, and airlines are particularly vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While some believe banks benefit from rising rates, increased delinquency can offset this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Warren Buffett has begun reducing his [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | banking sector]] investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Information on a company's debt levels can be found in its annual report or on financial websites like MarketSkinner.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.
*   **Avoid investing using debt**: When the economic cycle shifts, credit will only be available to investors with solvent portfolios, allowing them to capitalize on emerging [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has accumulated a record $140 billion in liquidity, demonstrating the value he places on cash reserves for future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Invest in companies with strong liquidity, attractive valuation, and high growth potential**: Companies with ample liquidity, like Berkshire Hathaway, can make strategic acquisitions during crises when credit is scarce and competition is low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. Warren Buffett has consistently followed this pattern during past crises (2000, 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Invest against bonds/debt (High Risk)**: This strategy carries high risk and requires significant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Inverse debt ETFs, such as ProShares' LTEFE (ticker TVEFE) for US 20-year bonds or DWS's LTEFE (ticker XSVS) for European debt, facilitate this for average investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. However, if the debt market doesn't fall within a reasonable timeframe, the high maintenance costs of these ETFs can limit their benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities
The following companies exhibit characteristics that could provide protection or even benefit from the current economic situation:

### Cisco Systems

*   **Price**: $44 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>
*   **Overview**: One of the best technology stocks of the last 30 years, having multiplied by over 200 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Cisco is a leader in manufacturing and distributing products for technological infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Its sales are stable and crisis-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Financial Health**: Cisco possesses significant liquidity and is debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. It is projected to end 2021 with over $17 trillion in debt-free liquidity, useful for acquisitions, business investment, or share buybacks during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Expected to earn around $3 per share in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. As a mature company, its growth potential is limited, possibly reaching $4 in earnings per share in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Valued at 15 times earnings, this suggests a target price of $60 per share, offering limited but stable potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. It's a crisis-resistant company with high liquidity, performing well in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### Constellation Software
*   **Ticker**: CS <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>
*   **Price**: $1,600 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>
*   **Overview**: One of the top technology stocks, having multiplied by over 80 times on the [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stock market]] in the last 12 years, yielding an average annual return of over 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The True Valió [[investment_opportunities_and_stock_market_analysis | investment fund]] first bought shares in 2014 at $200, multiplying its value by over 8 times since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>.
*   **Crisis Adaptation**: Constellation Software is well-suited for a debt crisis due to three characteristics:
    1.  **Large Liquidity**: Possesses substantial cash on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    2.  **Acquisition-Based Growth**: Grows by making acquisitions, which will be more abundant and attractively priced in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    3.  **Resilient Business Model**: Acquired businesses perform well even during economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. Its income grew from $200 million to over $700 million between 2006 and 2011, during the worst of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Gross profit also doubled in 2008-2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. Historical data for companies like Constellation Software can be found on sites like tikr.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: While future growth rates are projected to be lower than in the past, an average of 15% per year is still expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. At its current reasonable valuation, shares could reach $3,000, offering an average annual return of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. This represents an attractive [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investment opportunity]] for a safe and stable company that could see additional upside in a debt crisis, as it did in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

### Oracle
*   **Ticker**: ORCL <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>
*   **Price**: $60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>
*   **Overview**: One of the best technology companies of the last 30 years, with shares multiplying over 100 times on the [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Oracle provides important business management software, ensuring predictable income, high profit margins, and a high return on equity, indicative of a strong company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Its performance during economic crises, like in 2008, was excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Oracle is among American companies with the highest liquidity on their balance sheets, alongside Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: As a mature company, Oracle's earnings per share could rise to almost $5 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Valuing it at its historical average of approximately 20 times earnings, a target price of $100 per share is estimated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Compared to its current trading price of $60, this offers interesting potential, as it is a predictable, highly liquid, and crisis-resistant company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:46">[00:18:46]</a>.

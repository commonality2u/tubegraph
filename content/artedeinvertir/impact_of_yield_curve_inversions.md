The Federal Reserve has published a document outlining changes in the economic situation and when a possible recession could begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. CNBC news has also reported on the Fed beginning to forecast a decrease in GDP, which signals a potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While recessions often arrive when least expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>, and the market currently assigns only a 5% probability of one occurring in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, several indicators suggest a cooling economy.

## Economic Slowdown Indicators

### GDP Forecasts
The Federal Reserve's Atlanta division, through its "GDPNow" tracker, is forecasting a 1.5% drop in US GDP for the current quarter, a significant shift from previous predictions of 2.5% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This data, updated in real-time, has historically proven reliable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Declining Inflation
[[Impact of inflation on the market | Inflation]] is finally decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, largely due to the economic cooling that the Fed aimed for by keeping interest rates high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Both government reports and private data sources like "Truflation" indicate a collapse in inflation, correlating with a collapse in economic growth forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The real-time inflation rate is estimated at 1.5%, well below the Fed's 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Consumer Confidence
American consumer confidence has plummeted to 8-month lows due to economic uncertainty and policies like Trump's tariffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. The US has also seen its first fall in consumption in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

## The Yield Curve as a Predictive Tool
The yield curve is a crucial indicator that has predicted almost all crises in advance over the last 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. Every time the yield curve has inverted, a recession has typically followed within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### What is the Yield Curve?
The yield curve measures the profitability (interest rates) of 10-year US government bonds against 3-month bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.
*   **Normal Yield Curve**: Logically, long-term interest rates are higher than short-term rates due to increased risk and uncertainty over longer periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Inverted Yield Curve**: This occurs when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, raise short-term rates significantly to cool down the economy and combat [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The market, however, may see long-term bonds at lower yields, creating a negative differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

### Why Inversion Predicts Recession
When the yield curve inverts:
1.  **Increased Cost of Credit**: Mortgages and company financing become more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
2.  **Reduced Investment**: Companies cannot invest because long-term lending becomes less attractive for lenders, who prefer less risky, higher-yielding short-term loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.
3.  **Economic Slowdown**: This lack of credit, which fuels the economy, leads to a slowdown. For instance, rising housing inventory due to expensive loans means less construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
4.  **Psychological Effect**: The historical reliability of the indicator leads economic actors to question the economy's health, potentially turning fears into a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

### Historical Performance
Historically, a recession (represented by the shaded area) typically occurs *after* the yield curve has inverted and then begins to "dis-invert" (moves from negative to positive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>. This signals that the Fed is realizing the economy is slowing and is rapidly lowering short-term rates to reactivate it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Past inversions in 2000 and 2008 followed this pattern, with recessions occurring a year to two years later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Current Situation
The yield curve has experienced one of its strongest inversions in a long time, decisively moving to -1% by mid-2023, and is now beginning to dis-invert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>. Advanced GDP data seems to anticipate this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

## Investment Strategies During Economic Weakness
In a weak economy, prudent investment is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

*   **Avoid Debt for Investment**: Do not have debt to invest, especially when markets are at their highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>.
*   **Rotate Portfolio and Seize Opportunities**: When assets have fallen and are cheap, it is better to take on debt as the risk is lower and potential returns are higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:36">[00:18:36]</a>. This allows investors to rotate their portfolio and take advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Invest in Quality Companies**: Focus on companies with recurring income and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>. These "crisis-resistant" businesses tend to fall less during market downturns, serving as a source of liquidity to buy other assets that have dropped significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Maintain Liquidity and Long-Term Bonds**: Warren Buffett often accumulates liquidity before corrections to capitalize on opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>. Holding long-term bonds (e.g., via ETFs like TLT) is another strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
    *   If no recession occurs, these bonds maintain value and provide returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
    *   If a recession occurs, the Fed will lower rates, causing the value of long-term bonds to rise (as bond prices move inversely to interest rates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>.
*   **Buy During Fear and Panic**: Crises typically pass within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. The ideal time to buy is when there is widespread fear and panic in the market, as this is when the most money can be made <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:33">[00:25:33]</a>.
*   **Sector Rotation**: Different sectors perform better or worse depending on economic cycles. During a recession, stable consumption companies (food, drinks, clothing), utilities, and healthcare tend to perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a>. Conversely, during recoveries, sectors like real estate, technology, industrials, and financials, which suffer most during downturns, tend to perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>.

### Examples of Crisis-Resistant Companies
*   **Ahold Delhaize (AHOLD)**: A supermarket company with a strong presence in the US and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. During the 2008 financial crisis, its stock remained largely sideways or saw minimal drops, unlike the broader market's 60% decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>. The company has a 150-year history, demonstrating resilience through world wars, crises, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>. It has stable profits, a robust online presence, and is growing sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:10">[00:38:10]</a>.
*   **British American Tobacco (BAT)**: This tobacco company also falls under stable consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>. During the 2008-2009 global stock market crisis, BAT's stock dropped only 13% (10% with dividends) while the market fell 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:00">[00:48:00]</a>. The company maintained or increased profits during difficult periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:09">[00:49:09]</a>. While traditional cigarette volume is decreasing, new categories like vaping and oral tobacco are experiencing significant growth (20% annually until 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. BAT also holds a significant stake in ITC, a major consumer company in India, a rapidly growing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

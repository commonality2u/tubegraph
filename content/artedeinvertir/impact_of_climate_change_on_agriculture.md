Bill Gates, one of the world's wealthiest individuals, has made significant investments in arable land, becoming the largest landowner in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This strategic move is largely influenced by his negative outlook on [[climate change]] and its potential effects on the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>.

## Consequences of Climate Change on Food Production

Bill Gates' primary concern regarding [[climate change]] is the expectation of more extreme weather patterns, which would lead to reduced [[global_food_price_increases | global food production]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. This reduction in supply is anticipated to cause a drastic increase in the price of raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

Projections indicate that crops like corn could see a 24% reduction by 2050 due to [[climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. Coupled with a growing global population that will require more food, the price of [[agricultural_investment_opportunities | agricultural investments]] related to arable land is expected to continue rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. The value of land has consistently risen over several decades as the process of [[climate change]] has advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.

### Water Scarcity

A significant consequence of [[climate change]] is a projected shortage of water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. This makes arable lands with access to quality water highly valuable in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:08:00">[11:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:12:00">[11:11:00]</a>. Desalinating seawater and transporting it to where it is needed is expensive, and the cost of using water for agriculture can be prohibitive, leading to areas where crops cannot be produced without sufficient water <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:16:00">[11:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:28:00">[11:28:00]</a>.

Investor Michael Burry also believes that farmlands with water access will become very valuable, accumulating such investments as a protection against [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:36:00">[11:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>.

## Biofuels as a Solution

Agriculture is deemed very important by Bill Gates, partly because of the potential for cheap biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>. If affordable enough, biofuels could help solve the problem of CO2 emissions in transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Biofuels produced from raw materials like sugarcane, soybeans, or corn have favorable characteristics compared to other alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>. This sector is projected to experience significant growth, with the biofuels market expected to reach $300 billion by 2027, growing at an 11% annual rate, which is four times higher than the general economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:00">[03:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Investment Implications

Investments in land and agriculture are considered excellent during periods of high [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Despite potential reductions in disposable income, food consumption will always be maintained, ensuring demand for food grown on land and likely causing prices to continue rising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. During the high [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflation]] period of the 1980s, the price of arable land consistently rose, while other investments like the S&P 500 stock market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

Warren Buffett, a close friend of Bill Gates, has also recommended holding a portion of a portfolio in land and [[agricultural_investment_opportunities | agricultural investments]], citing them as very safe and profitable long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. Buffett himself owns over 2,000 acres of arable land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a> and would choose land over gold as an investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:21:00">[05:21:00]</a>. He views land and agriculture as a very profitable and safe investment category over a long enough period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

### Investment Opportunities for Small Investors

While direct land purchase can be complex, small investors can benefit by buying shares in companies related to agriculture or farmland <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a>.

*   **Agricultural Equipment Companies:** Companies like John Deere (ticker: DE) are leaders in agricultural equipment. Bill Gates has invested in John Deere shares, which have multiplied 20 times in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:00">[07:16:00]</a>.
*   **Plant-Based Protein Producers:** The rise in popularity of plant-based protein foods, such as Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods, is another driver for agricultural investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:20:00">[08:20:00]</a>. Bill Gates is a major shareholder in Beyond Meat, a sector estimated to grow over 9% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) owning arable land:** An example is Gladstone Land Corporation (ticker: LAND), which buys, sells, and rents agricultural land to farmers in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:10:00">[09:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:00">[09:36:00]</a>. This company's shares appreciated over 100% in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>. Gladstone Land has consistently maintained high land rental levels (over 99%), even during crises, and its rents have grown by an average of 3% per year, making it an excellent investment against [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.

Bill Gates, one of the world's richest and most powerful individuals, has made significant investments in arable land, becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. His strategy involves accumulating high-quality arable land across the U.S. through various holding companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. As of a recent report, Bill Gates owns over 240,000 acres of arable land, a number that continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This move is particularly notable given Gates' accurate macroeconomic foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Rationale for Agricultural Investment

One primary reason for Bill Gates' interest in [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investing]] heavily in the [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agricultural]] sector stems from his very negative outlook on [[effects_of_global_policies_on_inflation_and_energy_prices | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

### Extreme Weather and Food Production

The prediction is that more extreme weather conditions will lead to reduced global food production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. This scarcity would inevitably drive up the prices of raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, making quality [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investments]] in [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agriculture]] and arable land see drastic price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For example, corn crops are projected to reduce by 24% by 2050 due to [[effects_of_global_policies_on_inflation_and_energy_prices | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Coupled with a continuously increasing global population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, the demand for food and the value of related land are expected to rise constantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

Indeed, $1,000 invested in U.S. farmland in the 1950s would be worth over $1 million today, outperforming even the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Biofuels and Green Energy

[[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | Agriculture]] also plays a crucial role in the potential for cheap biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Biofuels derived from raw materials like sugarcane, soybeans, or corn possess favorable properties and could help solve CO2 emissions in transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. This sector is projected to be one of the fastest-growing in the economy over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The biofuels market is expected to reach $300 billion by 2027, growing at an annual rate of 11%, which is four times higher than the general economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

### [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | Inflation]] Hedge

Land is considered an excellent [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investment]] during periods of high [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. While not explicitly stated, Bill Gates may have a negative view on future [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The current market consensus anticipates a period of higher [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Historically, buying land and arable land has been one of the best ways to protect against [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Food consumption remains constant even if disposable income decreases, ensuring demand for food grown on land like Bill Gates's, and thus maintaining its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. During the high [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] period of the 1980s, arable land prices rose continuously, while other perceived "higher quality" [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investments]] like the S&P 500 collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Water Scarcity

The most compelling reason Bill Gates has given for his [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investment]] in this sector is the looming shortage of water due to [[effects_of_global_policies_on_inflation_and_energy_prices | climate change]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Arable lands with access to quality water will become extremely valuable in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.

> "The current problem is that it is expensive to desalinate seawater and move it where it is really needed. The cost of using water for [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agriculture]] is prohibitive and that is why there will be areas where crops cannot be produced without water." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>

## Endorsement from Other Investors

Renowned investor Warren Buffett, a close friend of Bill Gates, has also recommended that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio to [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investments]] related to land and [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agriculture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He considers them very safe and profitable long-term [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Warren Buffett himself holds over 2,000 acres of arable land in his [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investment]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. He has publicly stated that given the choice between gold and arable land, he would always choose land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

> "I believe that over a long enough period of time this [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investment]] category will prove to be very profitable and most importantly it will be by far a very safe [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investment]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>

This type of recommendation from Warren Buffett is significant, as he rarely speaks so favorably about an [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investment]] publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Another prominent investor, Michael Burry, also believes that farmlands with access to water will be very valuable in the future and is accumulating such [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investments]] for the same reasons and as a protection against [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities for the Small Investor

While directly buying arable land can be complicated for most small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, there are other avenues to benefit from the positive evolution of [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agriculture]] and land.

### Investing in Agricultural Stocks

One smart approach is to [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | invest]] in companies with higher added value in the [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agricultural]] sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

*   **Deere & Company (Ticker: DE)**: Bill Gates has [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | invested]] in Deere & Company, which trades under the ticker DE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. Known for its quality products and market leadership, Deere's shares have multiplied 20-fold in the last 20 years, outperforming even [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investing]] directly in arable land in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. As a preferred brand for farmers, its success is tied to the future of [[agriculture_and_food_market_dynamics_amid_global_tensions | agriculture]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. The company is estimated to earn around $18 per share, trading at less than 20 times earnings, which is considered fair for a high-quality company with low debt and predictable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Plant-Based Protein Companies

Another reason for Bill Gates's [[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | investment]] in this sector is the growing popularity of plant-based proteins, such as Beyond Meat and Impossible Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. Bill Gates is a major shareholder in Beyond Meat, which appreciated by 300% after its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. This sector is expected to be one of the fastest-growing in the future, with growth rates over 9% per year—almost triple that of the general economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, companies like Beyond Meat, despite leading positions, often have very high current valuations, posing risks if high expectations are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) Owning Arable Land

[[investment_opportunities_related_agriculture | Investing]] in REITs that own arable land is another option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

*   **Gladstone Land Corporation (Ticker: LAND)**: This company is a Real Estate [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | Investment]] Trust (REIT) that buys, sells, and rents lands to farmers in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. It benefits from tax advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. In the last five years, its shares have appreciated over 100% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. Gladstone Land Corporation owns over 100,000 acres of cultivated land in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, which is less than half of what Bill Gates owns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. The company has consistently kept its land rented at levels of 99% or higher, even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Rental prices have grown by an average of 3% per year, making it an excellent [[potential_impacts_on_savings_and_investments | investment]] against [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The company is estimated to earn $0.70 in earnings per share (measured as FFO), and while its current valuation is demanding, continued growth could see shares reach over $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

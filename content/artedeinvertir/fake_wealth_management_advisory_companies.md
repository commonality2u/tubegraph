The world of investments has seen a surge in popularity, attracting unscrupulous individuals who employ sophisticated deception techniques to acquire other people's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Among the dangerous schemes are fake wealth management advisory companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

## Modus Operandi

These scam companies typically initiate contact via phone, employing high-pressure sales techniques, often using women with pleasant voices to target a male audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Their method is ingenious:

1.  **Initial Contact**: They present themselves as a reliable company with the necessary permits to manage capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
2.  **Gaining Trust**: If a potential victim is skeptical, the scammers offer to open an account in the victim's name and deposit their own money, for example, 20,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. This is presented as a demonstration of their method, with assurances that no risk is involved for the victim if the money is lost, as it's the scammer's capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.
3.  **Fabricated Growth**: Victims are given passwords to access an online platform where they can monitor the account in real-time, observing the investments and the supposed growth of their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This data is entirely manipulated and not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. An example of such falsified extracts and associated platforms (like Red Forex) has been observed on websites such as Invertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The initial 20,000 euros will magically grow, potentially to 50,000 euros, with a displayed history of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
4.  **The Trap**: A second call is made, proposing that the victim deposit 20,000 euros into the account so the scammers can withdraw their initial capital, effectively giving the victim control of the now seemingly prosperous account <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. This preys on greed, as many are tempted to deposit 20,000 to "take control" of an account already worth 50,000 euros and seemingly growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Outcomes for the Victim

*   **Disappearance**: Once the victim deposits their 20,000 euros and attempts to withdraw the 50,000, the company typically disappears or cuts off all contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Further Loss**: Driven by greed, some victims may deposit even more money, believing they can multiply it further, leading to even greater losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   **Collusion with Brokers**: Sophisticated organizations may collude with low-reputation brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The deposited money is then churned through numerous operations to generate high commissions, funneling the victim's funds to the organization and the colluding broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.
*   **Derivative Operations**: Money may also be used to operate in derivatives where the broker is the counterparty, ensuring that the unsuspecting client's losses end up in the broker's or organization's pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## Identifying and Avoiding Scams

Scammers often promise high returns on the stock market without risk, which is a nonexistent concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If, in addition to increasing returns, you are required to attract new people to the "business opportunity," your distrust should be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

To avoid falling victim to these schemes, it's crucial not to be swayed by greed and to understand that nothing is given for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. If you seek a company to invest your money, always look for entities that are regulated by the highest stock market authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For example, in Spain, the CNMV is the highest regulator at the stock market and investment level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

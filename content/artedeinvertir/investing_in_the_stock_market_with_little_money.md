Investing in the stock market, even with a small amount of capital, can lead to significant wealth over time. Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors, began with just a thousand dollars and has shared key techniques for success in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article compiles seven key strategies mentioned by Buffett to help individuals succeed in the stock market with limited initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>.

## Seven Key Techniques for [[Stock Market Investing Strategies | Stock Market Investing Strategies]]

### 1. Invest in Good Businesses

The first and most important principle is to [[Stock market investments and strategies | invest in good businesses]] that can generate a high return for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This involves researching a stock that generates value consistently over 10, 15, or 20 years, meaning you do the work once for long-term benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. In contrast, buying a poor-quality stock just because it's cheap (e.g., it goes up 20-30% in the short term) requires immediate selling and repeating the research, losing out on the power of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

A "good business" is defined by its "moat" or competitive advantageâ€”something special that allows it to prosper against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This is often intangible or qualitative, requiring critical thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>.

*   **Examples of Poor Businesses**:
    *   **US Steel Corporation**: This is a typical steel manufacturing business with no competitive advantage. Steel is a commodity, meaning the company doesn't control its sale price, which is dictated by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Demand for steel also fluctuates with economic cycles. Over the last decade, US Steel yielded only 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.
    *   **American Airlines**: In a sector with high competition and supply, airlines cannot freely raise prices by 10% without losing customers to rivals like Lufthansa or Delta Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   **Toll Brothers**: As a US home builder, it's a cyclical business. They lack pricing power because houses are commodities, and consumers don't care about the builder's brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.
    *   **General Motors**: With over 40 global car manufacturers, differentiation is difficult, and customer loyalty is often low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

*   **Examples of Good Businesses**:
    *   **American Express**: This credit card business operates within a monopoly of three companies (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), unlike the thousands of steel producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It benefits from a "network effect," where more accepted businesses lead to more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. As an essential service, American Express can raise prices (e.g., the merchant fee) and still prosper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. Historically, it has yielded 1200% returns, multiplying its stock market value by 13 since 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
    *   **Google**: Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, considers Google the company with the greatest global competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Since its IPO, it has multiplied by nearly 50 times in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. It controls the main search engine and video channel (YouTube), allowing it to raise prices for advertisers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   **Coca-Cola/Nike**: These are consumer product companies with strong brand loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. They can control their selling prices because their products are highly desired, making them resilient even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Nike, for example, operates in a sector projected to grow over 10% in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

To [[How to start investing in the stock market | identify a good business]], learn to analyze its fundamentals by reading annual reports and considering competitive factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. A company that has performed well on the stock market for 10, 15, or 20 years usually indicates a good business that has generated value, not just luck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### 2. Invest Only in Businesses You Understand

Warren Buffett advises against investing in businesses you don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Understanding a business goes beyond knowing its products; it means having certainty that the company's profits will remain the same or, preferably, grow in the next five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.

*   **Disney** is an example of an understandable business. Its revenue sources (Marvel/Disney movies, merchandising, amusement parks) are clear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Iconic franchises like Mickey Mouse create a unique competitive advantage, allowing Disney to raise prices (e.g., theme park entry fees or merchandise) without losing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Disney's park entrance fees have increased significantly over decades, far outpacing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Moderna**, on the other hand, illustrates a business that is harder to understand from a long-term profit perspective. The future of vaccine production is uncertain, making it difficult to predict future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.

This principle helps investors prosper in any economic environment, benefiting from compound interest over decades by remaining disciplined and avoiding investments they don't grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>. While it's advisable to learn about new sectors to expand your circle of competence, resist the temptation of greed to invest in "hot" stocks without understanding their fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

Assessing a company's growth potential involves evaluating its market size and growth avenues, such as price increases (like Disney or Coca-Cola) or increased customer volume (like Nike or Adidas) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

### 3. Take Advantage of Opportunities (Be Patient)

The stock market is a mechanism that transfers wealth from the impatient to the patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. Major market downturns, like the March 2020 virus crisis, create opportunities to acquire good stocks at "ridiculous" valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Patience is key, as the market tends to reflect a company's real value in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

*   **Volkswagen (Dieselgate)**: After the scandal, Volkswagen's stock plunged from 250 euros to 80 euros. While it took three years to recover, patient investors who waited could reap significant rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   [[Investing in bear markets | **Bank of America**]]: During the 2009-2011 financial crisis, Warren Buffett invested over $5 billion in Bank of America at levels of $5 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. Despite being a lower-quality business, Buffett understood the sector and believed central banks would rescue banks. He had to wait until 2018 for the stock to return to $30, multiplying his investment by six times over nearly eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola (New Coke)**: When Coca-Cola released its "New Coke" formula that customers disliked, the stock dropped significantly. Buffett analyzed that the company could simply revert to the old formula, which it did. He bought shares at an attractive valuation (13 times earnings), multiplying his investment by 20 times since then <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **Apple (2016)**: In 2016, Apple's sales stagnated due to product renewal cycles and concerns about larger screens. Buffett invested $15 billion when the stock was trading at a historical minimum valuation (six times earnings, excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:01">[00:22:01]</a>. Despite short-term concerns, he recognized customer loyalty and the brand's strength, leading to a six-fold return on his investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **American Express (Client Fraud Scandal)**: An early investment by Buffett in American Express occurred after a large client defrauded the company. While the market panicked, Buffett saw it as a temporary issue for a fundamentally solvent business, leading to a successful long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.
*   **True Value Small Caps Investment**: An engineering company in the True Value Small Caps fund experienced a significant drop from $120 to $45 due to weak quarters and an accounting error scare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:08">[00:25:08]</a>. The fund increased its position, and even after another drop during the virus crisis, the stock recovered to $120, demonstrating the opportunity in temporary problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>. This highlights the [[Investment strategy for small caps | benefits of investing in small companies]] where more opportunities might exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:10">[00:27:10]</a>.

Do not be influenced by past price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>. A stock that has been flat may still have good future prospects if its fundamentals are strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a>. Don't feel bad about missing opportunities you don't understand, like cryptocurrencies; focus on what you can analyze deeply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>. Avoid greed and envy; stick to a defined [[Strategies for stock market investment | investment method]] and think long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:14">[00:29:14]</a>.

### 4. Don't Be in a Hurry to Sell

Charlie Munger, Buffett's partner, states that "real money" is not made through constant buying and selling, but through waiting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:05">[00:32:05]</a>. Wealth is built by finding investments that multiply by many times and holding them patiently as they generate value over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:22">[00:32:22]</a>.

*   **Wells Fargo**: Buffett invested in Wells Fargo in the early 1990s at $2.75 per share. Over 20 years, it multiplied by 10 times to $30 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Despite periods where the stock remained lateral for years or experienced corrections of 20-30% (or even 50%), patience paid off <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. The stock market's short-term movements do not always reflect a company's growing intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Apprentice (Software Company)**: A software company in the fund's portfolio multiplied by 10 times since 2014, going from $25 to $170 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:31">[00:36:31]</a>. This investment experienced several corrections of over 20%, including a 40% drop in 2017 and a 70% drop during the 2020 virus crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. Such experiences highlight that volatility is normal, and deep knowledge of the business provides the patience to hold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>.

Learning to make money without doing anything involves "being still" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Your guide should be the business's fundamentals (earnings per share, book value), not the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:42">[00:38:42]</a>. The stock market is there to serve you, not instruct you; a price drop doesn't automatically mean a bad stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

### 5. Enjoy Investing

Successful investors don't just invest for money; they enjoy the mental challenge of analyzing businesses and learning about what makes them progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:58">[00:39:58]</a>. This curiosity allows them to identify and bet on companies with better future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:20">[00:40:20]</a>.

### 6. Don't Be Envious or Greedy

Envy and greed are among the worst traits in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:45">[00:40:45]</a>. Many people are tempted to join "hot" or fashionable sectors and bubbles when they see others getting rich quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>.

*   **Dot-Com Bubble (Year 2000)**: During this period, when tech stocks boomed, many criticized Warren Buffett for his conservative approach. His Berkshire Hathaway shares were going down while the Nasdaq doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:40">[00:41:40]</a>. However, the Nasdaq then fell 60% in 18 months, and within two years, Berkshire Hathaway shares became more valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>. This illustrates that long-term success comes from sticking to your principles rather than chasing trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:27">[00:42:27]</a>.
*   **Recent Fads**: Since March 2020, "hot" stocks like electric vehicles, fake meats, renewables, and cloud computing saw rapid increases, often driven by speculative buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:28">[00:43:28]</a>. However, many have since started correcting. Buffett warns against buying based on past performance driven by greed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>.
*   **Moody's (2015-2017)**: Moody's, an impressive business with a strong competitive advantage, experienced sideways stock movement between 2015 and 2017 while the broader market rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:14">[00:44:14]</a>. Despite being undervalued, people were distracted by other "fashionable" stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:20">[00:44:20]</a>. However, its strong fundamentals (rising prices, margin expansion) eventually led to value recognition, with the stock quadrupling over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.

[[Stock investment advice | Investing in the stock market]] requires understanding its complexities; it is not "easy money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:03">[00:46:03]</a>.

### 7. Be Sensitive to Asset Valuations

Warren Buffett frequently discusses "intrinsic value," defined as the discounted cash flows over the remaining life of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:16">[00:46:16]</a>. While theoretical, this is a subjective value that can be estimated using various methods (e.g., multiples of PER, EBITDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>.

The stock price tends to replicate this intrinsic value over time, but the key is to buy when there's a significant difference between the intrinsic value and the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:29">[00:47:29]</a>. Focus on companies whose intrinsic value is growing over the long term, rather than those that are flat or decreasing (cyclical companies like energy, whose intrinsic value fluctuates with oil prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>. Companies like Coca-Cola or Microsoft have more predictable, stable, and increasing incomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.

### 8. Invest in Companies with Good Management

Good management that focuses on the long term tends to produce excellent benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:02">[00:50:02]</a>. As Jeff Bezos once said, good current results are due to work done five years ago to "plant a seed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:19">[00:50:19]</a>.

*   **Family Companies Study**: A Credit Suisse study showed that family companies (where management is aligned with shareholders) tend to outperform non-family companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>. Alignment can be measured by how long a manager has been in charge, their ownership stake in the business, and the ratio of their share value to their salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.
*   **Actions vs. Words**: Evaluate managers based on their actions, not just their words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>. If a company consistently meets its growth targets over several years, it's a good indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.

These tips are especially valuable when [[How to start investing in the stock market | starting to invest in the stock market with little money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>. Warren Buffett himself started with little capital, demonstrating that it's not a limitation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>.

### 9. Invest in Yourself (Bonus Tip)

The best investment you can make is in yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:56">[00:53:56]</a>. The more you learn, the more you will earn, as there is a direct correlation between knowledge of the stock market and economic benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>. This includes seeking quality education, reading books, and continuously learning from experienced professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:23">[00:54:23]</a>.

The current economic scenario, influenced by the 2030 agenda, is described as potentially the largest economic and social reform in decades, with significant implications for savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This agenda is supported by influential figures globally, including Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Some of the policies proposed within this economic plan are suggested as a cause for the current economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

## The 2030 Agenda and its Origins

The 2030 agenda, also known as "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world," originated from the Davos Forum, a gathering of powerful individuals like Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, state presidents, and influential businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This new economic plan was designed in 2015, and after seven years, it is now entering its most critical phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Many experts and economists suggest that these policies of the 2030 agenda could be the cause of the current crisis, especially due to [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | high levels of inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Klaus Schwab, who leads the Davos Forum (also known as the World Economic Forum), is a key figure behind these movements, aiming to modify the economic and social reality for the coming years through these policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. The motto of this global campaign is "you will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Ida Auken, a Danish politician, summarized the economic aspect of this agenda: "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

The World Economic Forum also published a promotional video titled "Eight predictions for the world in the year 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. Prediction number one states: "You will own nothing and you will be happy. You will be able to rent anything you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This suggests a shift from ownership to a rental or subscription model, which is already being experienced today and is proving beneficial for a small number of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Impact on Energy Prices

Predictions number 5 and 6 from the World Economic Forum are highlighted as particularly worrying and potentially a cause for the terrible [[energy_crisis_and_its_impact_on_inflation | inflation crisis]] experienced globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. While protecting the environment is a valid objective, the proposed method is described as radical, suggesting the complete elimination of fossil fuels without clear strategic planning for an energy transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Measures such as establishing price limits on gas or oil are also proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

The current [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation crisis]] is largely attributed to the high prices of fossil fuels like oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Over the past seven years, coinciding with the implementation of the 2030 agenda, a "battle against fossil fuels" has been established, proposing an energy transition without proper planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This lack of planning has led to a significant decrease in investment in the oil exploitation and production sector, falling by 60% from $600 billion annually to less than $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This decline in investment is generating the high [[impact_of_oil_price_fluctuations_on_the_global_economy | energy prices]] currently experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

<p>Due to these high price levels, oil and gas companies have become a "star investment" in 2022, even as the majority of the market has collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>. This includes companies like Occidental Oil, in which Warren Buffett has aggressively invested over $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.</p>

## Impact on Inflation

The high and [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | rising inflation]] is considered one of the most significant economic burdens for the average class and has historically led to higher levels of poverty and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. This [[role_of_energy_prices_and_inflation_in_current_economic_conditions | inflation crisis]] is directly linked to the high prices of fossil fuels, which are influenced by the radical energy policies of the 2030 agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

<p>The speaker notes a paradox: in the past, actions coordinated by industry that forced consumers to spend more would be considered a monopoly and abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. However, today, as these practices align with the objectives of the 2030 agenda or "great reset," they are approved and even encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. This includes companies like Microsoft and Adobe adopting subscription models, which significantly boost their profits over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.</p>

From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

The occupation of Ukraine has initiated an "economic war" that is expected to affect everyone, regardless of their involvement in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Finance ministers have already warned about the significant economic repercussions of the measures being taken <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. This article summarizes the current situation, its potential evolution, protective measures, and the impact on various sectors and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## Key Economic Consequences

### Rising Energy Prices
The most significant factor impacting the economy is the tremendous rise in oil and gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This exacerbates existing inflationary pressures that have already caused stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Historically, economic recessions have closely correlated with rising oil prices, particularly when Brent crude (inflation-adjusted) exceeded $100 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. High oil prices lead to reduced disposable income, decreased consumption, lower corporate earnings, and ultimately, a suffering economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | energy crisis and geopolitical tensions]] is a critical area to monitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Financial Sanctions and Trade Restrictions
The [[economic_and_trade_sanctions_on_Russia | economic and trade sanctions on Russia]] are severe, and their scope is extending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **SWIFT Exclusion:** The US, Canada, and other countries have begun excluding Russia from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international money transfers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. However, the German finance minister warned that a full exclusion would have severe [[consequences_of_financial_contagion_from_Russias_economic_instability | economic consequences]] for Germany and the rest of Europe, including the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   **UK Measures:** The United Kingdom has banned Russia and its companies from UK capital markets, a major source of financing for Russian firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This also limits the sale of Russian sovereign debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Targeting Oligarchs:** Western countries are greatly limiting the movements and assets of the Russian oligarchy, who control key sectors like oil, gas, banking, and [[transport_crisis and its economic impact | transportation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. This aims to put economic pressure on the Putin regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Restrictions on High-Tech Exports:** All exports of high-technology equipment to Russia are banned, impacting companies like ARM and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

These measures lead to volatility in the stock market in the short and medium term, though historically, such situations tend to dilute in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Sectors and Companies Affected

### Negatively Impacted Sectors
*   **Companies with Russian Exposure:** Many companies with significant sales or operations in Russia face problems. Examples include:
    *   Coca-Cola's Greek bottler <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>
    *   Carlsberg (beer company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>
    *   Inditex (owner of Zara), with 10-12% of sales linked to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>
    *   Renault (car company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>
    *   Philip Morris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>
*   **Luxury Brands:** Companies like Ferrari and Louis Vuitton, with a significant percentage of sales in the Russian market (5-10%), have seen their stock prices drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:06">[00:47:06]</a>.
*   **Financial Transaction Companies:** While global, companies like Visa and Mastercard could be affected if transactions are limited by SWIFT exclusion, though the impact is not as large as one might think due to their global nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:59">[00:47:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a>.
*   **Companies with Offshore Operations in Eastern Europe:** Industrial engineering firms with engineers in Ukraine or other Eastern European countries, like Genpact, saw their shares plummet due to concerns about worker relocation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:46">[00:53:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.

### Positively Impacted Sectors
*   **Energy Sector:** Companies involved in oil and gas exploration and production, such as Marathon Oil and Cheniere Energy (which exports liquefied gas), have benefited greatly from rising energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials:** Fertilizer companies like Mosaic have benefited as Russia is a large exporter of fertilizers, and their exclusion from international trade increases demand for Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:46">[00:15:46]</a>.
*   **Defense Sector:** The defense sector, including companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, has seen significant benefits. Countries like Germany are drastically increasing their defense budgets, which will lead to purchases of state-of-the-art equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a>.
*   **Government Subcontractors:** Companies providing technological, logistical, and cybersecurity support to governments during conflicts, such as KBR International and Leidos, also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Times of Crisis
In times of crisis, it's crucial not to be naive about the [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | impacts of global crises on the economy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:34]</a>. Historically, war conflicts have had minimal long-term negative effects on markets, though short-term drops of 10-20% are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>. The key is to avoid making poor short-term decisions that could jeopardize long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

### Opportunities in Downturns
*   **Buying during Corrections:** Buying during market corrections (falls of more than 10% in indices like the S&P 500) has historically yielded excess returns over one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
*   **Pessimism as a Buying Signal:** The best time to invest is when pessimism reigns and stocks are cheaper, often when bearish sentiment outweighs bullish sentiment among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:35">[00:25:35]</a>.
*   **Patience:** Market fears often last a year or two, not just overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:58">[01:02:58]</a>. Patience is critical for long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:20">[01:03:20]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quality and Valuation:** Successful investing involves a balance of quality businesses and reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>. While strong companies might be expensive, good businesses with growth at reasonable valuations yield the most money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:18">[01:06:18]</a>.

### Company-Specific Examples
*   **Marathon Oil:** An oil exploration and production company, benefiting from high oil prices. It is returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, indicating management believes its shares are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:45">[00:31:45]</a>. Oil companies' value depends on factors like cash return to shareholders, reserves, and breakeven costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>.
*   **Adidas:** An iconic German company whose shares dropped due to proximity to the German market and exposure to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. However, it's a long-term value generator, has a share buyback program, strong brand power, and pricing power in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:18">[00:38:18]</a>. Its current valuation is low compared to its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:00">[00:42:00]</a>.
*   **Alibaba:** While its recent results were weak, its valuation is at an all-time low, trading at 11-12 times earnings (or minus 10 times excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:32">[00:43:32]</a>. The market is influenced by fears about delisting and potential Chinese alignment with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:37">[00:43:37]</a>.
*   **Google:** Despite publishing spectacular results, its stock price is lower and remains cheaper than some defensive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:26">[01:21:26]</a>. The money for future returns lies where there is fear and attractive valuations, allowing good businesses to be bought for temporary reasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:52">[01:21:52]</a>.

### Understanding Cyclical vs. Quality Businesses
Cyclical companies, like oil or construction (e.g., DR Horton), depend heavily on market ups and downs and can experience long periods of stagnation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:46">[03:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:15">[01:05:15]</a>. Quality businesses, such as those with strong brands, pricing power, and consistent growth (e.g., Adidas, Visa, Mastercard, Google), tend to prosper across various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:44">[00:38:44]</a>. While cyclical companies can offer short-term trading opportunities, long-term wealth is built with quality companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:29">[01:03:29]</a>.

This [[impact of RussiaUkraine conflict on global stock markets | impact of RussiaUkraine conflict on global stock markets]] is a testament to the fact that the stock market is akin to seasons, with periods of "winter" (downturns) that are inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:46">[00:56:46]</a>. Investors should learn to navigate these environments with a calm head and long-term perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

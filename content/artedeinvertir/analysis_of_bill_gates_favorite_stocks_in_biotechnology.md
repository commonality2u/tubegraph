Bill Gates, considered one of the world's richest and most powerful individuals, appears to be preparing for a new crisis similar to past events by accumulating stocks in vaccine-producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This represents a radical shift in his [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. His movements and statements are closely watched by millions of investors globally due to his often accurate foresight regarding the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Foresight and Investment Shift

During the last crisis, Bill Gates played a significant role by warning of a likely pandemic and the world's unpreparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. His deep understanding of the biotechnology sector also allowed him to predict which company would first develop a successful vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

Recently, his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | investment portfolio]] has become public, revealing a shift that suggests preparation for a crisis akin to the one experienced in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He has [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | radically changed his investment strategy]], concentrating 70% of his investments in just three vaccine-producing stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Many investors are questioning if this new strategy reflects a negative outlook on the evolution of the crisis that began in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Investment Vehicles

In the United States, stock market transparency rules mandate that institutional investors with assets exceeding $100 million periodically report their stock purchases and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Bill Gates primarily utilizes two investment vehicles:
*   A fund for more traditional and safer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   The portfolio of the Billy and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is the focus of this new [[bill_gates_vaccine_investment_strategy | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

## Core Biotechnology Investments

Within the Billy and Melinda Gates Foundation portfolio, three stocks—BioNTech, CureVac, and Vir Biotech—now account for over 70% of his investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These companies are leading the development of "second-generation vaccines," which are expected to be more sophisticated and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

In a CNN interview, Bill Gates explained that a return to normalcy depends not on the first generation of vaccines, but on the next generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. He noted that the problem of variants returning to richer countries is due to insufficient and slow global tackling of the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>, necessitating these second-generation vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His statements, combined with his portfolio movements, indicate which companies are best positioned to develop these solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>.

### Risks and Rewards in Biotechnology

Investing in biotechnology companies, especially those in the development phase, can be highly risky and volatile, requiring a high level of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The number of failed clinical trials is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, successful ventures can yield very high financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

*   **BioNTech (BNTX)**: BioNTech, in collaboration with Pfizer, was the first company to develop an effective vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Bill Gates began investing in BioNTech at the end of 2019, six months before the crisis started, turning an initial $50 million investment into over $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. Despite some believing these products would be a one-time demand, BioNTech predicts a demand for one million doses per year from 2022 onwards, suggesting a recurrent business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. The company is estimated to earn over $37 per share, trading below 10 times earnings, which is attractive for a biotechnology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **CureVac (CVAC)**: Bill Gates invested in CureVac in 2015 with $50 million, now valued at over $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. This German company is collaborating with large pharmaceutical companies like GlaxoSmithKline on second-generation vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. CureVac is in a development phase, meaning it is not yet profitable and highly dependent on the success of its clinical trials, making it a more speculative and volatile investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Vir Biotechnology (VIR)**: Bill Gates also showed good judgment by investing in Vir Biotechnology in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. This highly innovative company is developing an effective solution against multiple variants, including the Delta variant, with over 82% effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. An additional reason for his interest might be the development of an inhaled vaccine solution, eliminating the need for injections and potentially increasing public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Like CureVac, Vir Biotechnology is in the development phase, not yet producing benefits, making it a speculative and high-risk, high-reward action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

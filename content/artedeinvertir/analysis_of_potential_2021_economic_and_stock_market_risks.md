The beginning of 2021 presented significant concerns for the economy and stock market, following a challenging year in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Investors pondered the possibility of a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Influential investors like Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Michael Burry raised caution signals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Key Risk Factors for 2021

### Health Crisis Evolution
A primary concern at the start of 2021 was the mutation of a current health problem, leading to fears of faster transmission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This development caused panic among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, resulting in immediate reactions like flight cancellations, border closures, and new containment measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Sectors most affected in the markets included airlines, hotels, and catering companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Significant uncertainty existed regarding the effectiveness of existing remedies against the new variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, and uncertainty typically negatively impacts the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

### Economic Stimulus Measures
Further complicating the situation were the new economic stimulus measures approved in the U.S., which amounted to approximately $900 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. This figure was considerably lower than the double the market had initially anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. The Federal Reserve and these stimulus measures were crucial for the 2020 recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Warren Buffett notably broke his silence to urge the American government to increase stimulus measures to avert an "economic disaster" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He emphasized the need for Congress to act immediately with another injection of money to provide liquidity to families and corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Market Euphoria
Famous investor Stanley Druckenmiller expressed concern over what he termed "absolute euphoria" in the markets, suggesting that after the "party comes the hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He predicted that the next 3 to 5 years would be "very, very complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Bull markets often conclude with the appearance of widespread euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.

One significant sign of current euphoria is that the traded volume of options surpassed that of shares for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Options are leveraged investment instruments involving debt, meaning their value rises much faster when the market increases, but they fall much more sharply when the market declines, potentially losing all value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>. Goldman Sachs data shows that the volume of traded options reached record levels, hitting figures of $400 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In times of high greed or euphoria, options become the preferred instrument for speculators seeking quick wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

Joel Greenblatt, an investor with annual returns exceeding 30% for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, also warned of significant market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. He noted that in 2020, buying every company with a market capitalization greater than a billion dollars that lost money in 2019 would have yielded an impressive 65% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While companies must eventually produce profits to justify their valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, basic investment principles seem to be forgotten during periods of euphoria, leading to the anomaly where companies that lost more money performed better in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Historically, investing consistently in companies that lose money typically results in negative or significantly lower returns than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in High Growth Stocks
Despite the market risks, the video discusses high-growth stocks that performed well in 2020. Not all companies with losses are bad investments, as examples like Amazon and Netflix show they can eventually become profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Valuation Method for High-Growth Companies
A three-step method is suggested for valuing high-growth companies that are currently producing losses:
1.  **Estimate Future Sales**: Project sales for the next three to five years, assuming a growth rate lower than current rates due to scaling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
2.  **Estimate Future Profit Margins**: Determine potential profit margins once the company reaches maturity, by looking at mature companies in the same sector (e.g., Toyota for automotive, Microsoft/Google for tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This provides a future profit figure and earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier**: Apply a suitable earnings multiplier (P/E ratio). For good industries with continued growth potential (e.g., tech), 30-40 times earnings might be appropriate. For more cyclical industries (e.g., automotive), a lower multiplier of 15-20 times earnings might be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

### Case Studies
*   **NIO (NIV)**: Listed at $48 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, NIO multiplied by over 12 times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. While having losses, its estimated sales for the next two years are $4.7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Applying a 6% net profit margin (similar to Volkswagen or Toyota <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>) on $50 billion in future sales yields $3 million in net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>, or around $2 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Using a 15 times earnings multiplier (for an automotive company with growth), the intrinsic valuation is approximately $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This suggests NIO was trading above its fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. However, a strong conviction could project higher sales (e.g., $100 billion), leading to $4 profit per share, and a value up to $80 at 15-20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>.

*   **Tesla (TSLA)**: Priced at $680 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>, Tesla multiplied by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It began to show profits in 2020 after losses in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 index propelled shares to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Michael Burry, known from "The Big Short," invested against Tesla due to its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, sending a Twitter message to Elon Musk reporting a bearish position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Burry noted that Tesla's market capitalization of over $600 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a> was higher than other traditional automakers, despite generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. Bloomberg compared electric vehicle companies' market value per vehicle produced against traditional manufacturers. Electric vehicle companies were assigned significantly higher values per vehicle (e.g., over $1.6 million for some, over $1 million for Tesla) compared to traditional manufacturers (e.g., Volkswagen at $10,000, Toyota at $25,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. Investing against a stock is dangerous and requires experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>; investors must conduct a detailed study of Tesla's evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

*   **Palantir Technologies (PLTR)**: Listed at $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>, Palantir more than tripled since its listing at $10 three months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>. It is a high-growth technology company with unique data analysis technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a> and is currently producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Expected to invoice $1.4 billion in 2021, and conservatively growing at 40% annually, it could generate $7.5 billion in sales in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. With potential profit margins of 20-25% (similar to Microsoft, Oracle, Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>), Palantir could achieve $1.8 billion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>, equating to $1 earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Applying a 30 times earnings multiplier (for a high-quality tech company), the fair value for Palantir's future is around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>. This suggests the current price incorporates a significant portion of future benefit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>.

*   **Alibaba (BABA)**: Listed at $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>, Alibaba faced a Chinese government investigation for alleged monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Some speculate this was a message to founder Jack Ma for his criticism of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. In jurisdictions with fewer investor rights, such issues can lead to stock market losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. From a financial perspective, Alibaba's valuation is attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings, and its intrinsic value could be double the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>, with significant future growth expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:29">[00:17:29]</a>. However, the political factor is more significant than the financial one in the short to medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>, requiring monitoring of the situation's evolution and the company's cooperation with government guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.

## Protecting Investments in 2021
To navigate potential risks in 2021, investors are advised to apply common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.

1.  **Maintain Liquidity**: Keep between 10% and 30% liquidity in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Statistically, the market corrects at least 10% every year, creating opportunities to utilize this liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
2.  **Invest with Conviction**: Only invest in companies where a thorough, in-depth analysis has been conducted, and there is strong conviction that it is a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Even in a euphoric or expensive market, good investment opportunities can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
3.  **Monitor Major Investors**: Observe how prominent investors position their portfolios. For instance, [[Stanley Druckenmiller | Stanley Druckenmiller]]'s main investments included Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft, characterized by high growth and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Michael Burry's investments focused on Google, Pfizer, and ACWT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. [[Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]]'s portfolio for 2021 was also detailed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

While 2020 was complicated, maintaining good health and prudent investment strategies are key for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

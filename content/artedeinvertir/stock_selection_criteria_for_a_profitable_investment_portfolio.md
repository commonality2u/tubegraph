Many individuals wonder if it's possible to sustain a predictable and increasing income over time purely from the stock market. The answer is yes, though with certain nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Ways to Make Money from Stocks

There are two primary methods to generate income from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

1.  **Revaluation (Capital Gains)**: This involves buying a stock with the intention of selling it later at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The challenge with this method is its dependence on other investors being willing to pay more for the shares in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. It often leads to less predictable and more volatile results, as market recognition of a stock's value can take months or even years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Dividends**: This method involves investing in companies that periodically distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The key advantage here is that income generation does not rely on future investors paying more for the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Instead, it depends on a correct [[stock_analysis_and_investment_strategies | analysis of the company]]'s ability to generate stable and growing profits, leading to more predictable income over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Many companies that pay dividends also reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business to foster growth, which can lead to future revaluation of the stock in the longer term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Building a Profitable [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | Investment Portfolio]]

To achieve a consistent profitability objective, such as $100 or $100 euros per day, focusing on dividend-paying stocks is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Diversification

Academic studies suggest a diversified [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | investment portfolio]] should include:
*   Investments across at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   Between 15 and 20 individual shares that meet the profitability objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

It's important to view the portfolio as a whole, understanding that some stocks may exceed dividend expectations while others may fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. A key benefit of this [[investment strategies and advice | investment philosophy]] is that it reduces the need to constantly monitor stock market prices; the focus shifts to the company's future dividend payments, assuming good companies with strong profit and dividend generation capacity are selected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

## Finding Suitable Dividend Stocks

Identifying dividend stocks that align with profitability goals requires specific criteria and tools.

### Stock Screening Tools and Filters

Tools like **Investing.com's Stock Screener** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> can help in this process by allowing searches based on specific filters:

*   **Dividend Yield**: Personally, a filter between 6% and 10% is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>. Yields above 10% are often unsustainable, while those below 6% might require significantly more capital to meet a daily profitability target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **Historical Dividend Growth**: Set a lower limit of 0% to avoid companies that have reduced their dividends over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. An upper limit of 10% average annual growth is suggested, as aggressive dividend growth combined with a high current yield is uncommon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Examples of companies appearing from such filters include telecommunications companies like AT&T (with a 7% dividend) and companies like Las Vegas Sands or Iron Mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This filter can also be applied to specific regions like Europe, Latin America, or Canada, where high-dividend companies like Pembina Pipeline Corporation and Northwest Healthcare Properties REIT might appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

Other useful tools for researching dividend stocks include:
*   **Seeking Alpha**: For reviewing a company's historical dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.
*   **Market Screener**: To monitor expected dividend payments for future years, ensuring stability or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>.

### General Company Criteria

Beyond yield and growth, look for companies with:
*   Low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.
*   High resistance to economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.
*   Trading below their average historical valuation, indicating potential for future revaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:13]</a>.

## Calculating Required Investment Capital

To achieve a specific daily profitability objective, like $100 or $100 euros (equivalent to $3,000 per month or $36,000 annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>, a realistic dividend yield objective is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. While some safer companies might offer 3-4%, they require significantly more capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. Conversely, yields of 10-12% are often unstable and prone to cuts during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

The ideal is to build a portfolio with an average dividend yield of around 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>, comprising the recommended 15-20 diversified stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.

The formula to calculate the required investment capital is:
*   `Capital = Annual Target Benefit / Expected Portfolio Profitability` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>

For a $36,000 annual target and a 7% average yield:
*   `Capital = $36,000 / 0.07 = $504,000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:00">[06:58:00]</a>

The two main variables in this formula are the expectation of average daily performance and the portfolio's capacity to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Increasing the portfolio's profitability reduces the capital needed, while decreasing the daily performance expectation (e.g., to $50) would halve the required capital (around $250,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

Dividends are typically sent automatically to your broker account, deposited monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>.

Regarding taxation, most countries tax dividends between 20% and 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. A common issue is "withholding tax" or "double taxation" when receiving dividends from outside your country of tax residence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:31:00">[07:31:00]</a>. While recovering this can be complex in many countries, for US-listed stocks, the W8BN form (offered by many quality brokers like [[choosing_a_broker_for_investments | Interactive Brokers]]) can prevent this double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities

Here are four examples of companies that meet the criteria for dividend investing:

### 1. Altria (MO)

*   **Sector**: Consumer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.
*   **Listing**: US (NYSE: MO), around $42 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend History**: Offers a high dividend yield with stable and growing payments for over 50 years, including 51 consecutive years of increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:00">[08:39:00]</a>. Average growth of 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>.
*   **Current Yield**: Greater than 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>.
*   **Characteristics**: Low debt, highly resistant to economic crises, and trading below its average historical valuation, indicating potential for future revaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:05:00">[10:05:00]</a>.

### 2. Enbridge (ENB)

*   **Sector**: Oil and gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:14:00">[11:14:00]</a>.
*   **Listing**: Canada (TSX: ENB), around 42 Canadian dollars per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend History**: Uninterrupted high dividends for 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:04:00">[11:04:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Contracts are not tied to oil or natural gas prices; customers pay for pipeline usage or volume transported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>. This has allowed profit increases even in difficult years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook**: Expects 5-7% annual profit growth and corresponding dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:02:00">[12:02:00]</a>.
*   **Current Yield**: 7.5% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:12:00">[12:12:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trading below historical valuation due to negativity in the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>, but unaffected by recent price drops.

### 3. Red Eléctrica (REE)

*   **Sector**: Electric transport monopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Listing**: Spain (BME: REE), around 16 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend History**: Dividend yield of over 6% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:11:00">[13:11:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Monopoly on electric transport in Spain and parts of Latin America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. Electricity consumption is typically constant and increasing, making it a crisis-resistant sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Impact**: As a regulated monopoly, recent government-proposed changes affecting remuneration caused investor panic and a stock price drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading below its historical average valuation, making the revaluation component potentially more interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook**: Confirmed plans to continue paying dividends of over one euro per share for the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:26:00">[14:26:00]</a>.
*   **Similar Stock**: Enagas (Spain), also in gas/oil transportation, offers an 8.5% annual return and a stable dividend, but also affected by recent regulatory changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.

### 4. National Health Investors (NHI)

*   **Sector**: Real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on housing and residences for the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.
*   **Listing**: US (NYSE: NHI), around $66 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.
*   **Tax Advantage**: As a REIT, it has the tax advantage of distributing the majority of its profits as dividends without paying corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:46:00">[15:46:00]</a>.
*   **Sector Characteristics**: Crisis-resistant and poised for growth due to the aging population, ensuring continued high demand for its services and properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:00">[16:03:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth**: Impressive dividend increases over the last decade, from $2 to over $4 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:00">[16:25:00]</a>.
*   **Key Metric**: For REITs, focus on "Funds From Operations" (FFO) rather than accounting profit, as it reflects the true capacity to generate profits and pay dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:43:00">[16:43:00]</a>. NHI's FFO increased by 3% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Also trading below its historical valuation average, suggesting potential for future revaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

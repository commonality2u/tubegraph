The 2020 edition of [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]]'s annual conference was held recently, lasting over five hours and attracting thousands of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This summary compiles the most important parts of the conference, including [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]]'s key messages and analyses of specific stocks.

## Key Insights from the Conference

### Cautionary Stance and Liquidity Accumulation
[[Warren Buffetts recent statements and statements and investments | Warren Buffett]]'s first significant message was one of caution, which is unusual for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. His actions supported this, as Berkshire Hathaway was a net seller of stocks in the first quarter, not buying new investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. The company's liquidity increased from $120 trillion to over $130 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment insights during market crises | Warren Buffett]] stated that the voluntary closure of a substantial part of society has no historical reference, unlike the 2008 economic train derailing due to banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. He characterized the current situation as "a great experiment" with an "enormous range of possibilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. Despite this, he remains convinced of the potential of the United States, as he was during World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, or the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

While he warned of potentially "very flying moments" in the short term, [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] insisted that the long-term prospects for the American stock market remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### Reflecting on Investment Timing
When asked why he wasn't buying stocks, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]] acknowledged his timing in 2008 was "terrible" as he would have been "better off" waiting four or five months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. However, even with bad timing, attractive opportunities in the market led to a good outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. He advises investors to "do things the way he does them, not the way he says you should do them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His actions during the first quarter suggest he anticipates more volatility and is accumulating liquidity while waiting for a better time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

### Sale of Airline Positions
A significant surprise was [[warren_buffetts_recent_investment_strategies_and_tips | Warren Buffett]] selling his entire position in the four major American airlines, a combined investment of over $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. He explained that the "airline business has changed significantly" due to people being told not to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. He noted that these companies would need to borrow over $10 trillion each and would have to repay this debt using future profits, potentially through selling shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This drastically reduces their investment potential, and he believes it will take "two or three years to get back to last year's passenger numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies | Warren Buffett]] emphasized that when he feels he has made a mistake in a position, he sells it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

### Market Crash Indicators
[[Warren Buffetts investment insights during market crises | Warren Buffett]] provided clues on factors that could indicate a large market crash, like the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He highlighted that people in 1930 did not initially realize they were in a depression, thinking it was a typical recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The true "great crash" of the 1930s occurred in 1930, following a partial recovery from the 1929 drop, leading to a monstrous 80% decline over the next 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.

The causes of the 1930s decline included over 4,000 bank bankruptcies and widespread loss of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Today, mechanisms exist to prevent such financial panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] stated he is calm about the current health of the financial system, seeing no stress within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Notably, his main portfolio position is in four large American banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### Outlook on Oil and Boeing
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]] commented on oil, noting the excess production combined with low demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. He predicted a significant drop in U.S. oil production as it's not profitable to extract at current prices (below $40 a barrel) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This explains his lack of investments in oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

Regarding Boeing, [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] highlighted the rapid deterioration of its financial future, noting the company had to request $25 billion and previously $14 billion in a short time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. He questioned the future need for so many new airplanes, acknowledging the uncertainty for both Boeing and Airbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Stock Analyses

### TSM (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company)
TSM, ticker TSM ($50/share), is a leading global microchip manufacturer with over 10,000 different products and 500 clients, including major corporations like AMD, Nvidia, and Apple (which accounts for over 17% of TSM's income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. TSM operates on a "fables model," focusing solely on manufacturing chips designed by others, a strategy that has allowed them to develop an unmatched scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

Despite the semiconductor sector's cyclical nature, TSM has smoothed out this cycle due to its competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. For example, its profits increased over 50% between 2007 and 2010, one of the worst periods for semiconductor companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. TSM boasts a gigantic 40% profit margin on revenue, exceeding Intel's 30% operating profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. Its return on invested capital consistently stays above 25%, significantly higher than the industry average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

TSM currently has no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. It's estimated to earn around $3 per share for the current year, trading at a P/E of approximately 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Assuming continued annual growth of 100% in the coming years (as in the past five), earnings could reach $5 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. Historically, TSM has traded at a P/E of 16, suggesting a future target price of $90 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

### JP Morgan (JPM)
JP Morgan, ticker JPM ($90/share), is a significant holding in [[Buffetts 2021 stock portfolio | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. It is described as a high-quality bank that has grown more than 15 times on the stock market over the past 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. Investing in banks requires high confidence in the management team, as their operations can be opaque <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies | Warren Buffett]] considers Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, to be "probably one of the best and most trustworthy managers in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. JP Morgan is an "undisputed leader" among major American banks in terms of return on equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies | Warren Buffett]] suggested valuing banks based on their price-to-tangible book value. He highlighted that a business earning 15-17% on its tangible equity in a world of 3% bonds is "incredible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. JP Morgan's tangible book value is $60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Applying [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]]'s suggested three times book value multiple, the implied current target price is $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:57">[00:15:57]</a>. If book value grows to $90 per share over the next five years, the future target price could reach $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.

### Boeing (BA)
Boeing, ticker BA ($120/share), was also discussed by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] at the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. While historically an excellent investment, multiplying by over 200 times since going public in the 1960s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>, Boeing has experienced a strong fall in the stock market from nearly $400 to $120 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

The company faces two main problems: reduced demand for new aircraft due to the current global situation (expected to affect the next two years) and design problems with the 737 Max, which led to two accidents in 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>. These factors have put Boeing in serious financial trouble, having borrowed almost $30 billion in debt and considering a government bailout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

In the long term, these problems are expected to resolve. Air traffic is estimated to fall by 20% in 2020 but recover to pre-crisis levels by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The 737 Max is considered a very competitive model against Airbus's A320 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>. Analysts estimate Boeing could be earning $12 per share by 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:27">[00:19:27]</a>. Historically, Boeing has traded at an average P/E of 20, which would imply a target price of $240 per share, representing interesting potential over three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:32">[00:19:32]</a>. However, the high debt significantly increases risk; if the current problem extends, it could lead to capital increases or government bailouts, affecting future valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

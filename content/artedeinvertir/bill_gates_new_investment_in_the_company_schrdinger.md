[[Bill Gates investment portfolio | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest and most influential individuals, has recently begun selling shares on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. However, he has also made a significant new investment in the American company Schrödinger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This investment, totaling over $500 million, suggests optimism for the future of this high-growth stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Company Profile: Schrödinger

Schrödinger is a highly innovative American company that uses its new technological platform to help pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs or vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. This technology aims to reduce development time and increase effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

The company's shares are listed in the U.S. under the ticker SDR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>, currently trading at $71 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

## Investment Rationale

Schrödinger possesses high growth potential for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The medical research and clinical trials market in the U.S. alone is valued at $47 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Despite this vast market, Schrödinger is currently only billing $150 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, even though it is growing at rates above 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

One of the primary reasons that may have driven [[Bill Gates investment strategies and decisions | Bill Gates]] to invest in Schrödinger is his long-term vision for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. If the company successfully captures just 10% of this enormous market, its value could increase several times over its current stock market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

## Outlook and Risks

While promising, Schrödinger's shares currently trade at a very demanding valuation and do not produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Its valuation is higher than 40 times sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

Despite these challenges, this investment is the only stock in which [[Analysis of Bill Gates portfolio changes | Bill Gates]] has recently invested, highlighting its perceived high growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a>.

Ray Dalio, renowned as one of the most successful investors and the world's largest investment fund manager, developed an investment method known as the [[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This strategy aims to provide positive returns across various economic conditions, known as "economic seasons," which are primarily influenced by inflation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:50">[06:16:50]</a>.

Initially, Dalio privately utilized this system for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Due to its consistent success and low risk, he decided to make it public so that any investor could use it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:16">[02:02:16]</a>. The original [[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] proposed a specific asset allocation designed to perform well in all four economic scenarios: high growth, low growth, accelerating inflation, and disinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:48">[06:40:48]</a>.

## Original All Weather Portfolio Allocation

The original [[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] recommended the following asset allocation for investors:
*   **Large-cap American stocks**: 30% weighting, typically replicated by purchasing an ETF like the S&P 500 (ticker SPY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:43">[09:52:43]</a>.
*   **Long-term American bonds**: 40% weighting, accessible via an ETF like iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (ticker TLT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:15">[10:22:15]</a>.
*   **Medium-term American bonds**: 15% weighting, replicated with an ETF such as iShares 3-7 Year Treasury Bond ETF (ticker IEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:21">[10:41:21]</a>.
*   **Commodities**: 7.5% weighting, typically through an ETF like iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (ticker GSG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:40">[11:21:40]</a>.
*   **Gold**: 7.5% weighting, easily recreated with an ETF like SPDR Gold Shares (ticker GLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:57:12">[11:57:12]</a>.

## Recent Adjustments to the Strategy

While Ray Dalio continues to employ his [[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather strategy]] for managing his investment funds, he has recently implemented certain changes to its composition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:26">[13:00:26]</a>. These adjustments are publicly visible through the holdings of his firm, Bridgewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:04">[13:16:04]</a>.

The three main changes observed in his current portfolio include:
1.  **Reduced Weight in Bonds**: Dalio has slightly decreased the allocation to fixed income (bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:49:15">[14:49:15]</a>.
2.  **Increased Weight in Gold**: The investment in gold has been significantly increased. His portfolio shows gold ETFs (like GLD and IAU) totaling over 15% of the portfolio, which is double the original 7.5% recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.
3.  **Increased Weight in International Stocks**: There's a notable shift towards international stocks. While still holding a substantial portion in large-cap U.S. stocks (around 24% through SPY and IVV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:00">[13:40:00]</a>, he is now investing in ETFs focused on international markets, including India (e.g., ticker INDA) and emerging countries (e.g., ETFs representing large-cap stocks from Brazil or Korea) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:00">[14:00:00]</a>.

These changes indicate a dynamic approach to asset allocation, even within the framework of a historically stable strategy like the [[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]].

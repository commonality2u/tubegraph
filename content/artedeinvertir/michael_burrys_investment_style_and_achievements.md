Michael Burry is a renowned investor who gained significant fame for being one of the first to predict the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His story was immortalized in the Brad Pitt-produced film "The Big Short," which earned five Oscar nominations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Career and Scion Capital

Before becoming a legendary investor, Michael Burry was a doctor by profession, combining his medical work with his passion for the stock market in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He actively shared his investment ideas and results on various internet forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This online activity led to investors offering him a million dollars to start his own investment fund, which became Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Scion Capital quickly achieved impressive results. In its first five years, primarily investing in stocks, the fund consistently outperformed the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>:
*   **Year 1:** 8% return (S&P fell 7%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
*   **Year 2:** 55% return (S&P fell 11%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>
*   **Year 3 (2002):** 16% return (S&P fell 22%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>

These strong returns attracted a flood of capital, leading him to manage over $500 million for clients in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## The 2008 Crisis Prediction and Achievements

As depicted in "The Big Short," Michael Burry's [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and portfolio changes | investment style changed radically]] in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. He shifted from buying stocks to investing his entire fund against the impending crisis, a bet that proved challenging initially as it wasn't immediately paying off, making investors nervous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

However, the crisis became evident in 2007 and 2008, and his "big bet" yielded enormous profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. In 2007 alone, Scion Capital achieved a 160% return, cementing Burry's status as a legend in the investment fund industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His fund generated over $700 million in profits for its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, and his personal fortune quickly exceeded $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Scion Capital achieved an accumulated return of 700% annually for its clients, making it one of the most successful funds while managing client money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Burry's story is particularly motivating as he built his success without a financial background, contacts, or prior experience in the sector, relying purely on effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies and advice from Michael Burry | Michael Burry's Investment Style]]

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry's investment strategy]] and [[investment strategies and advice from Michael Burry | advice]] can be condensed into three key principles:

### 1. Contrarian Investing: Buying Ignored Companies

Michael Burry's core [[michael_burrys_investment_strategy | investment strategy]] is to buy shares in ignored companies that appear to be on the verge of bankruptcy and sell them once they have shown slight improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. He emphasizes that portfolio management is as crucial as company selection for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. This approach explains his current strong preference for the retail and energy sectors, which are currently out of fashion but offer cheap companies with significant potential for regularization if conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

He likes to mix "contrarian" stocks—those not currently in fashion and beaten down by the market but trading at good prices—with "good quality" stocks that have no problems and trade at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### 2. Concentrated Portfolio Management

Burry prefers a concentrated portfolio, typically holding "between 12 and 18 stocks in depressed industries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[0:10:16]</a>. He believes this number of positions allows him to have his best ideas while smoothing out volatility, preventing confusion between portfolio volatility and risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. A portfolio with fewer than 25 stocks is generally considered concentrated, a philosophy shared by other renowned investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Quality Companies

In addition to contrarian bets, Burry is willing to add companies that align with Warren Buffett's preferences: those with a competitive advantage and a high return on capital, provided the market offers them at good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. This principle explains his investment in Google, which he identifies as a classic high-quality company with a competitive advantage, trading at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This highlights [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and portfolio changes | Michael Burry's flexibility]] as an investor, capable of both contrarian and more mainstream, value-driven investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

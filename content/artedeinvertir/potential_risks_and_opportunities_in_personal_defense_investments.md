Ray Dalio, a globally recognized investor, has issued warnings about a new world economic order that could lead to significant [[economic_risks_and_investment_strategies | economic risks]] and social reforms, with serious implications for the [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | stock market]] and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He suggests that the United States is entering a phase of decline characterized by high debt and extensive money printing, leading to economic and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Gravest Concern

Ray Dalio's most significant concern revolves around the potential for severe economic consequences stemming from government bankruptcies, particularly after economic shocks and where there have been large economic inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. He states that the single most important advanced indicator of wars and revolutions is the bankruptcy of governments following economic shocks and significant economic inequalities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. While this risk is not immediate, if the economy continues its current trajectory, it could reach an inflection point with severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Potential Unrest

In such a scenario, one type of investment that could perform well is in companies that manufacture personal defense products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Case Study: Axon Enterprise (AXON)

*   **Company**: Shares of "Taser," known as Axon Enterprise, which manufactures personal defense products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: Listed in the U.S. under the ticker AXON <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Current Price**: Trades at $75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:15">[00:12:15]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance**: Since 2008, when the level of social inequality began to rise, the shares of Axon Enterprise have appreciated from $6 to over $75 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>, driven by high demand for its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading at an attractive valuation of only 11 times this year's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>.
*   **Potential Upside (Historical Average)**: If traded at its historical average of approximately 16 times earnings, it would represent a potential appreciation of over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **Potential Upside (Dalio's Scenario)**: Should the scenario proposed by Ray Dalio materialize, Axon Enterprise shares could see "much, much higher potential and several times their current price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

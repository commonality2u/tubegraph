BlackRock, an investment company described by many sources as the "owner of the world," controls over $10 trillion in assets, making it the largest shareholder in many of the world's main listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. This colossal asset base represents more than 10% of the world economy, surpassing the economic size of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. With this significant power, BlackRock faces accusations of enabling damage to the environment, social inequality, and financial fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## BlackRock's Influence in the Financial Sector

BlackRock's client base includes banks, insurers, pension plans, sovereign funds, and even individual small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The company holds majority positions in major global banks such as Wells Fargo, Banco Am√©rica City Group, and Banco Santander, effectively controlling the financial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>.

It is paradoxical that many of these banks are also BlackRock's primary clients, providing it with increasing funds annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This allows BlackRock to expand its controlling stakes in the world's leading companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. In essence, money provided by clients of these banks, often through investment plans or even deposits, frequently ends up invested in BlackRock products under its commercial name, iShares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This creates a "circular structure" where money from a bank's clients flows to BlackRock, which then uses it to acquire more shares in that same bank, solidifying its control and increasing its global power and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### Controversial Auditing Division

Further complicating matters is BlackRock's controversial "BlackRock Solutions" division, which audits and controls the risks posed by major global banks to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This gives BlackRock intimate knowledge of these banks' internal accounts and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This situation presents a clear conflict of interest, as BlackRock acts as both a primary investor in these banks and their internal risk controller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. Despite BlackRock's claims of maintaining "Chinese walls" to separate these operations, many observers question the effectiveness of such measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

BlackRock's influence is so profound that the Federal Reserve even tasked it with dismantling failed banks, such as Lehman Brothers, during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## Cross-Industry Control and Competition Concerns

The concentration of power in BlackRock generates potential conflicts of interest, particularly regarding competition between different companies controlled by a single entity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. For instance, while BlackRock may not appear as a major shareholder in McDonald's, it does appear among the main shareholders of McDonald's competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This indicates that BlackRock can control leading companies within the same sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Many sources question the freedom of competition in sectors where the same owner exerts control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. This pattern of concentrated ownership is also evident in the automobile, airline, and financial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

BlackRock and Vanguard combined control over $15 trillion in assets and are the main shareholders of 85% of the world's principal listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Their influence extends to the media sector, where they are estimated to control 95% of traditional and new generation media, including platforms like Facebook, as their largest shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

## [[BlackRocks role in environmental and social issues | Pressure and Influence]]

In 2021, BlackRock leveraged its power to pressure companies it controls, such as ExxonMobil, to reduce CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. ExxonMobil subsequently committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050, a curious commitment for an oil and gas production company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Risks of [[Passive investing risks | Passive Investing]] and Concentrated Power

The growth of passive investing, with 60% of money invested passively in the United States, raises concerns about who truly controls companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Investors who buy BlackRock's passive products delegate their voting rights over underlying companies to BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This results in power being concentrated in very few companies, which ultimately control the main global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

Some large investors, like [[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Michael Burry]], who predicted the 2008 financial crisis, warn that [[passive_investing_risks | passive investing]] and ETFs represent a "huge bubble" due to the high valuations many companies are reaching, regardless of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. As stocks rise, these automated systems are compelled to buy more shares, further inflating valuations and attracting more passive investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Burry suggests this "music will stop playing" when capital outflows exceed inflows, likening it to a game of musical chairs where the longer it's played, the higher the risk of being left without a chair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.

Investors are advised to take full responsibility for their investments, understand where their money is invested, know the commissions paid, and assess the risks and expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Training and continuous learning are crucial to navigate the complex financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

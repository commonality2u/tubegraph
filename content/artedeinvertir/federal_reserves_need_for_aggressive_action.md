The Federal Reserve needs to act much more aggressively to combat inflation and prevent a significant market collapse, according to renowned investor Bill Ackman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Ackman, known for his accurate market predictions, emphasizes that without decisive action, economic problems could worsen, leading to severe consequences for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Current Economic Situation and Inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>

Recent market falls on Thursday and Friday were influenced by expectations that [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] would moderate, but it has instead worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Several key indicators highlight the severity of the economic situation:

*   **Consumer Confidence** Consumer confidence is at historic lows, even below levels seen during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. This is significant because consumption accounts for 70% of the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   **Mortgage Applications** Applications for new mortgages in the U.S. are at a 22-year low, indicating a significant slowdown in the housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The sale of homes has stalled, largely due to the interest rate on a typical 30-year mortgage climbing to 6.2%, a level not seen in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.
*   **Persistent Inflation** [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | Inflation]] remains a major concern, with gasoline prices significantly impacting consumer confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Even excluding the price of cars, [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] is at 6.6%, and was close to 7% on a recent Friday <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Inflation Expectations** People are increasingly perceiving [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] as permanent rather than temporary, which drastically alters consumer psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. Expectations for [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] over the next three years have risen from a historical average of 2.5% to 3.7%, with forecasts for 2023 now ranging from 4.5% to 5.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.
*   **Economic Slowdown and High Inflation** The current economic environment is unique in history, with the economy slowing down while [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] is close to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This forces the [[Federal Reserves economic strategies | Fed]] to fight [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]], which could further accelerate the economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
*   **Unemployment Level** While unemployment is at a low level, which is usually positive, in the stock market, the *expected change* in unemployment is what moves the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. A shift from very low to increasing unemployment is viewed negatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Recommendations to the Fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>

Bill Ackman conveyed his recommendations to [[federal_reserve_secret_meeting_and_its_implications | Federal Reserve]] officials during a meeting of a select finance club in New York, sponsored by the [[federal_reserve_secret_meeting_and_its_implications | Federal Reserve]] Bank of New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. This informal advisory group helps inform the [[federal_reserve_secret_meeting_and_its_implications | Fed]], which sets the rules of the game and has a significant impact on the economic level of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.

Ackman's core recommendations include:

*   **Higher Neutral Interest Rate** The [[Federal Reserves impact on interest rates | neutral interest rate]] should be much higher than the expected 2.75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Balance Sheet Contraction** The [[federal_reserves_economic_plans | Fed]] must accelerate the contraction of its balance sheet, reducing the amount of money previously printed to solve the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Interest Rate Hikes** Interest rates should be raised more aggressively, including multiple increases of 0.5%, possibly even 0.75% or 1% at upcoming meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

## Ackman's Counter-Market Vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>

Ackman holds a view contrary to the prevailing market sentiment, which suggests that rising rates will negatively affect valuations and cause an economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. His perspective is that if the [[Federal Reserves economic plans | Fed]] acts decisively:

*   **Market Confidence and Rally** Investors will gain confidence that [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] is going to end, leading to an upward explosion in markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Market-Forced Recession** If the [[Federal Reserves economic plans | Fed]] does not do its job, the market will <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. A collapsing stock market, with people losing money, ultimately generates a recession in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. The two ways to stop this are aggressive rate hikes or an economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Benefits of Decisive Action** Rising interest rates decisively and aggressively, with market understanding, will lead to a strong market recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. While low interest rates tend to favor long-duration assets like stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>, the Fed's role is to keep [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] in a predictable range (e.g., 2-3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.
*   **Nipping Inflation at the Root** By raising rates, the [[Federal Reserves economic plans | Fed]] is "nipping the problem of [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] at the root" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. This decisive action provides confidence that [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] will not become entrenched and structural in the economy, as seen in countries like Argentina, Venezuela, or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Economic Prosperity** Although aggressive rate hikes may cause a specific recession, they assure the market of long-term economic prosperity with low [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This means there will be no need for constantly high interest rates like those (30% annual rates) seen in countries with structural [[inflation_concerns_and_monetary_policy_actions | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Ackman suggests taking the "band-aid" off now to avoid a "bigger wound in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>.

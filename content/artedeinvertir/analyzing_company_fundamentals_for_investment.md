Warren Buffett has stated that it is possible to generate annual returns of up to 50% when managing a small amount of money, specifically less than a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This concept, repeatedly discussed by Buffett, highlights a significant structural advantage: not having a lot of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Advantage of Small Capital
While Warren Buffett's current fortune is estimated at $80 billion, his annual returns have decreased over the years, from 50% to around 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. He considers 10% a good result given his current level of assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This reduction in potential returns with larger capital is due to the limited investment opportunities for vast sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

> "If I were working with a small sum of money, I would do things completely different from what I do now. Your universe expands and there are thousands of possibilities for investing ten thousand dollars, but there are not many alternatives for investing 100 trillion dollars." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>
>
> "You have to move a lot of rocks to look for these anomalies. You have to look for companies that are off the map, very off the map, you might find small, local companies that are doing fine." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>

These statements imply that [[analyzing_companies_with_high_liquidity_and_growth_potential | having less capital]] allows investors to explore a much broader range of companies, including those that are overlooked by larger funds due to their size or lack of liquidity.

## Finding Investment Opportunities
[[analyzing_stock_opportunities | Finding exceptional investment opportunities]] requires significant time and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. These opportunities will not present themselves without active search <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

### Focusing on Small Caps
The key is to focus on small companies, often referred to as "small caps" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While the US market has over 30,000 listed companies, only about 500 are included in the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. These S&P 500 companies are heavily analyzed, making it difficult to generate returns above 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

However, the remaining 29,500 companies are where "local businesses" or "off the map" opportunities can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. These are often non-globalized or non-international companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Western Insurance Example
Warren Buffett cited Western Insurance as an example of an undervalued company he found. It was trading at $3 per share but was earning $20 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. His advice was to "buy as much as possible" of such opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Case Study: Humanice
The True fund, when managing a smaller capital of 9 million euros, invested in Humanice, a micro-company that barely capitalized 30 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Humanice was largely ignored by analysts and investors, yet it was a good business with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **Valuation**: Humanice was trading at 1.50 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Earnings**: It was projected to earn 1 euro per share the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   **P/E Ratio**: This gave it a P/E ratio of less than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

Following Buffett's advice to buy as much as possible of such investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, the fund accumulated a position of around one million euros at 1.50 euros per share over four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Three years later, the shares traded at 6 euros per share, multiplying the purchase price by four times and generating a significant profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This success was attributed to being prepared and knowing the sector, as well as taking time to look for opportunities in small or lesser-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## The Importance of Learning and Preparation
Warren Buffett advises young investors to "learn as much as possible about all kinds of American stocks" because "all that knowledge will help him a lot in his future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He emphasizes that "luck does not exist; it is simply the combination of opportunity and preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. If an investor is not prepared to identify opportunities, they cannot take advantage of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Research Tools
Historically, investors like Buffett would comb through "Moody's manuals" â€“ thick books detailing financial information for thousands of listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These manuals provided historical data on price, P/E ratio, sales, benefits, and a summary of the company's operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:42">[00:05:42]</a>.

Today, similar information is available for free on platforms like Yahoo Finance and Morningstar.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Additionally, modern "stock screens" allow investors to filter stocks by various parameters such as low P/E, growth rate, or profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Strategic Approach to [[understanding_companies_before_investing | Understanding Companies Before Investing]]
To begin [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | analyzing stock market investments]] for high returns, it's recommended to:
1.  **Choose an attractive industry**: Such as health, IT, technology, or transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  **Learn about that sector**: Start by reading reports from the largest companies in that sector, as they provide detailed information on how the sector works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.
3.  **Look for smaller companies**: Once knowledgeable about the sector, search for smaller, potentially undervalued companies within it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## The Liquidity Factor and Valuation
Good investors in small companies eventually manage large amounts of money, which can make them stop [[analyzing small caps investment potential | accessing these companies]] due to liquidity issues. There may not be enough shares in circulation to invest large sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This highlights why small investors have an advantage.

It is essential to focus on paying a low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio for investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. A stock trading at $10 and earning $1 per share (P/E of 10) is unlikely to yield 50% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, finding a stock that earns $1 per share and trades at $2 (P/E of 2) could potentially yield a 50% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Therefore, [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | focusing on very cheap investments]] is crucial for generating extraordinary returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Korean Stocks Example: Deja Flor
Around 2004, Buffett's friend gave him a book on Korean stocks. He spent hours scanning the book, looking for cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He found several interesting opportunities and invested $100 million across 20 Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

One such stock was Deja Flor, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea, a large and stable economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Deja Flor's EPS in recent years ranged from 2,800 won to 23,800 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.
*   **Investments**: It also had 100,000 won per share in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **Trading Price**: The stock was trading at 38,000 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>.

Buffett stated, "You have to make money buying stocks like this at twice the profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. He made a very good return, as the stock quickly appreciated from 38,000 Korean won to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

These types of situations have always existed in markets and will continue to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Success in [[analysis_of_key_investments_and_market_conditions | analyzing company fundamentals for investment]] requires illusion, passion, curiosity, hard work, and the willingness to do things differently from other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

Ray Dalio, renowned as the world's largest investment fund manager, has issued new warnings regarding the future of the economy and markets. His influence stems from a track record of successfully navigating market crises over the last 20-30 years, including famously predicting the 2008 financial crisis, which he even warned the US government about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. The market pays significant attention to his pronouncements because his words often align with the actions taken by his funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.

## New Economic Warnings

Dalio's latest warning suggests the future could change significantly, leading him to adopt a more defensive posture in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His concerns are rooted in several interconnected factors:

### Political Polarization and Geopolitical Shifts
He observes tremendous political polarization within the United States, specifically between Republicans and Democrats, and even mentioned the risk of civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Concurrently, Dalio highlights a shift in global power from the United States to China, which could lead to future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. This shift is central to his concept of the [[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | new world order]], within which he has suggested the dollar might cease to be the world reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

### End of "Easy Money" and High Inflation
Dalio warns of a significant policy change by the Fed and other central banks, moving away from "easy money" policies like low interest rates and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He anticipates periods of high inflation and much more difficult financial conditions as a consequence of past easy money policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Recent inflation data has been higher than in the last 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

### Expected Lower Market Returns
In a February 10th video, Dalio discussed the need for investors to prepare for significantly lower rates of return in the markets compared to the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While past returns averaged 8-10%, he predicts they could fall to as low as 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. He also noted that these lower returns would come with a much higher level of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He has specifically warned that the world could change "in a quite alarming way in the next five years" due to these worsening financial conditions, the [[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | new world order]], and internal US polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Portfolio Adjustments
In line with his warnings, Ray Dalio has significantly adjusted his portfolio:
*   He sold 90% of his shares and reduced weight in nearly 300 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   He sold almost all shares from emerging countries, as these and technology stocks tend to correct more during market volatility due to being considered risky assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.
*   His purchases have been in defensive shares like Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which are expected to perform better during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These stocks have shown very little decline in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

His actions demonstrate a clear defensive positioning of his portfolio, reflecting his concerns about the evolving economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

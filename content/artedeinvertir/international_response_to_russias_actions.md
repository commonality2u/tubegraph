The conflict or occupation of Ukraine has entered a second phase, described as an "economic war" that will affect everyone, regardless of their involvement in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Finance ministers have warned that the measures being taken by countries will be very significant for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Broader Geopolitical Implications
The situation raises concerns about what might happen if China takes advantage of the situation, given its similar stance that Taiwan belongs to it, mirroring Russia's view on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Recent months and years have seen significant military tensions regarding Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. On February 24th, Taiwan reported that nine Chinese fighters entered its airspace, and there has been a military buildup similar to Russia's near Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Japan's Prime Minister, Mr. Abe, stated that if China invades Taiwan, Japan and the United States "could not stay aside" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. The lack of military consequences for Russia's invasion of Ukraine might embolden China to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Economic Consequences
The primary [[economic_consequences_of_the_ukraine_occupation | economic consequences of the Ukraine occupation]] are expected to lead to serious problems in the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Energy Prices and Inflation
A major factor is the significant rise in oil and gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. This could worsen inflationary pressures that were already causing the [[stock_market_reactions_to_geopolitical_conflicts | stock market to collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Historically, economic recessions have been closely linked to rising oil prices, especially when Brent crude (adjusted for inflation) exceeds $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This correlation exists because inflationary pressures reduce disposable income, leading to less consumption, which negatively impacts company earnings and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

The previous economic measures against Russia when it invaded Crimea led to a 30% collapse of Russia's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. However, the current situation's [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | geopolitical tensions and their economic impact]] could extend these effects to Europe and the US, making it more severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### SWIFT System Exclusion
The US, Canada, and other countries have begun to exclude Russia from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international money transfers and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. While this blocks Russia, the German finance minister warned that a full exclusion would have severe [[consequences_of_ukraine_invasion_on_global_finance | economic consequences for Germany]], the rest of Europe, and consequently the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. As of the time of the recording, measures were selective, targeting certain banks and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The German government explicitly stated that suspending SWIFT would have a "massive impact" on German businesses and, by extension, the German and European stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:02">[01:10:02]</a>.

### Specific Measures and Sanctions

The United Kingdom was the first country to establish very specific measures against Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Other countries are expected to follow suit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
Key measures include:
*   **Ban from UK Capital Markets:** Russia and its companies are banned from UK capital markets, a main source of financing for Russian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This could limit the issuance of new debt and shares for Russian companies listed on Western markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.
*   **Limitations on Sovereign Debt:** The sale of Russian sovereign debt in markets like London will be limited, with potential extension to other markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.
*   **Targeting Russian Oligarchs:** Measures heavily target the Russian oligarchy, who control key sectors like oil, gas, banking, and transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. These individuals financially support the Putin regime. Western countries are limiting their movements and fortunes to pressure the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Limiting Foreign Bank Holdings:** Russian citizens' money in foreign banks is being limited to $66,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **High-Tech Export Bans:** All exports of high-technology equipment to Russia are banned, impacting companies like ARM and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>.

## [[stock_market_reactions_to_geopolitical_conflicts | Stock Market Reactions to Geopolitical Conflicts]]

While war conflicts have had minimal long-term negative effects on the stock market, short-term drops of 10-20% are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:13">[02:00:13]</a>. Buying into the stock market when there are drops of 10% or more (corrections) in the S&P 500 has historically yielded excess returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:48">[02:00:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>. For example, after an 11% drop in 1997 due to the Asian financial crisis, the market yielded 21% a year later and 47% after two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:04">[02:01:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:10">[02:01:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:17">[02:01:17]</a>. In 86% of cases, returns after two years are significantly higher, often exceeding 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:25">[02:01:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:28">[02:01:28]</a>.

### Companies Affected

Some sectors and companies are more exposed to the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>:
*   **Coca-Cola's Greek bottler** has substantial sales in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:12">[01:03:12]</a>.
*   **Carlsberg** (beer company) has significant sales in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:15">[01:03:15]</a>.
*   **Inditex** (Zara's owner) generates 10-12% of its sales from Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:19">[01:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:24">[01:03:24]</a>.
*   **Renault** has a notable percentage of sales in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:30">[01:03:30]</a>.
*   **Philip Morris** could see a large percentage of sales evaporate if excluded from the SWIFT system or trade with Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:44">[01:03:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:50">[01:03:50]</a>. Due to operating leverage, a 10% loss in sales could lead to a 30-60% drop in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.
*   **Luxury Brands** like Ferrari and Louis Vuitton saw drops due to the concentration of troops and the conflict's start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:31">[01:05:31]</a>. Ferrari's valuation is demanding, at 35 times profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:32">[01:06:32]</a>. Louis Vuitton's Chinese market accounts for 25-30% of sales, and the Russian market for 5-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:01">[01:07:01]</a>.
*   **Visa and Mastercard** could be affected by SWIFT limitations, though their global nature means the effect might not be as significant as perceived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:59">[01:07:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:05">[01:08:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:25">[01:08:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:30">[01:08:30]</a>.
*   **GRIFOLS** (industrial engineering company) saw its shares fall due to its reliance on offshore engineers in Eastern European countries like Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:34">[01:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>. While affected, they can relocate workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:46">[01:09:46]</a>.
*   **Robin Hood** (brokerage) experienced significant drops, reflecting the withdrawal of retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:29">[01:10:29]</a>.
*   **Wizz Air** (airline) plummeted due to the conflict, as it operates extensively in Eastern Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:47">[01:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.

### Companies Benefiting

Some sectors and companies have benefited from the current situation:
*   **Energy Sector:** Companies like Cheniere Energy, which exports liquefied natural gas (LNG), could benefit significantly as Russia reduces gas supply to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:04">[01:05:04]</a>. Marathon Oil is another example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:29">[01:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>.
*   **Raw Material Companies:** Fertilizer companies like Mosaic and Nutrien are well-positioned, as Russia is a large exporter of fertilizers. Their exclusion from international trade would increase demand for Western producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>.
*   **Defense Sector:** The defense sector, including companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman, is expected to benefit from increased defense budgets (e.g., Germany plans to drastically increase defense spending, potentially doubling it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:26">[01:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:33">[01:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:41">[01:06:41]</a>. These increases are generally for state-of-the-art equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:14">[01:07:14]</a>.
*   **Government Subcontractors:** Companies like KBR International and Leidos, which provide technological, logistical, and cybersecurity support to governments during conflicts, also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:42">[01:07:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>.

## Investment Strategies During Times of [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | geopolitical tension]]

In times of market volatility, it is important to maintain balance and avoid emotional reactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:12">[01:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. While human tragedies, war, and other events are beyond individual control, focusing on manageable areas, such as investment knowledge, is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:22">[01:09:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:29">[01:09:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

### Key Principles for Investors
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** In the long term, conflicts like wars do not significantly affect the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:22">[02:00:22]</a>. The stock market has survived major events like World War II, often showing better average returns during such periods because bad news is already "discounted" into asset prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:24">[02:02:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:27">[02:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:45">[02:02:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>.
*   **Avoid Bad Short-Term Decisions:** It's crucial not to make decisions in the short term that could mortgage long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:26">[02:00:26]</a>.
*   **Embrace Volatility:** Recognize that volatility is a natural part of the market, akin to seasons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:27">[02:06:27]</a>. Expecting perpetual growth is naive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:48">[02:06:48]</a>.
*   **Psychological Preparedness:** Mentally prepare for things to worsen or remain unchanged in the short term to avoid disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:47">[02:02:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:51">[02:02:51]</a>. Manage expectations, as human beings often compare to the immediate past rather than long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:27">[02:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>.
*   **Buying Opportunities:** Periods of pessimism, when "bears outperform bulls," are often the best times to invest because stocks are cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:32">[02:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:38">[02:05:38]</a>. The current environment, where the small company index has corrected significantly, presents a good breeding ground for future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:16">[02:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:19">[02:06:19]</a>. Money in the stock market is earned during these downturns, not during euphoric highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:25">[02:06:25]</a>.
*   **Quality and Valuation:** Aim for a balance between business quality and reasonable valuation. Avoid merely buying the cheapest stock or the "best" at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:39">[02:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:41">[02:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:44">[02:05:44]</a>. The ideal strategy is to buy good stocks with growth potential at a reasonable valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:14">[02:06:14]</a>.
*   **Patience:** Fears in the stock market often last a year or two. Patience is crucial for long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:19">[02:03:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:22">[02:03:22]</a>. People often get frustrated because they expect immediate results in a culture of immediacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:53">[02:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:10">[02:04:10]</a>.
*   **Cyclical vs. Quality Businesses:** Be cautious with cyclical companies (like oil or gold miners) as their performance is heavily tied to commodity prices, which they do not control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:13">[01:18:13]</a>. Good businesses, like Adidas or Visa, tend to prosper in many economic environments, especially if they have pricing power in inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:44">[01:08:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:46">[01:08:46]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio to mitigate risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:52">[01:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.
*   **Asymmetric Investments:** Seek investments where the potential for significant gains (e.g., 300%) outweighs potential losses (e.g., 20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:39">[01:22:39]</a>. This often means investing in good, predictable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:21">[01:23:21]</a>.

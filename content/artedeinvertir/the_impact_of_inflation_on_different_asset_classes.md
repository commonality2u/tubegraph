Inflation and its potential [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | impact on investments]] is a significant concern for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. Noted investor Michael Burry has structured his portfolio to [[inflation_impact_on_investment_portfolios | benefit from assets that are expected to rise]] with inflation, and to hedge against those expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

## General Principles

High [[impact_of_inflation_on_the_market | inflation]] can have a significant [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | impact on various assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. Some assets may benefit, while others may be harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. When [[impact_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_investments | inflation rises]], central banks typically consider raising interest rates to control it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## Impact on Bonds

When [[impact_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | inflation rises]], interest rates normally go up, which causes bond prices to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. Michael Burry structured a bet that there would be high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation]] during the next months or years, which would significantly affect bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>.

*   **Longer Duration Bonds:** Bonds with longer durations, such as 20-year or 10-year corporate debt, are more sensitive to increases or decreases in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. For example, a 1% rise in interest rates can cause a 20-year bond ETF (like TLT) to drop by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:47">[01:09:47]</a>.
*   **Short-Term Bonds:** Very short-term bonds, like three-month or six-month treasury bills, are not significantly affected by interest rate changes due to their short duration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>.
*   **Michael Burry's Strategy:** Burry has invested in put options on bond ETFs (like TLT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:27">[01:17:27]</a>. This allows him to earn significant profits if the asset price drops, with a limited risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:51">[01:17:51]</a>. He has also invested in inverse leveraged ETFs on bonds (like TBT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:50">[01:29:50]</a>. This strategy benefits greatly if bond prices fall due to rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:25">[01:54:25]</a>.

## Impact on Stocks

### Growth Stocks and Companies Without Profits

Companies that do not generate profits, often high-growth technology stocks, are harmed by high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. Michael Burry has made bearish investments against certain growth companies, such as Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:44">[00:24:44]</a>.

*   **Tesla:** Burry made a massive bearish bet (short position) on Tesla, seeing its valuation as unjustified by its core automotive business and future software development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>. He used put options to structure this bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>.

### Value Stocks and Companies with Operational Leverage

Value stocks, especially those trading at reasonable valuations, tend to do well during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>. Companies with operational leverage, where costs remain relatively stable while sales increase, can see disproportionate profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:03">[01:34:03]</a>.

*   **Facebook and Google:** Michael Burry has made massive bullish bets on Facebook and Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:34">[01:28:34]</a>. These companies can raise prices for ads during [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation]] and are not expected to be significantly harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>. Their business model allows them to grow sales while keeping costs almost the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials Companies:** These companies benefit from rising raw material prices (like steel, copper, aluminum, wood, oil) caused by [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_various_sectors | inflation]] and supply chain issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Natural Resources:** An oil and gas production company from Canada, it has substantial reserves and can generate significant free cash flow even with fluctuating oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:30">[01:51:30]</a>.
    *   **Atalaya Mining:** A copper production company, it benefits from copper's bullish future driven by [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation]], undersupply due to lack of investment in new mines, and increasing demand from electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:08">[02:13:08]</a>. An electric car requires four times more copper content than a traditional car <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:40">[02:17:40]</a>.
    *   **Lundin Energy:** An oil production company with operations in Canada, Malaysia, and Europe, it is well-managed and generates strong operating cash flow at current oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:45">[02:22:45]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Sector (e.g., DaVita):** Companies providing essential services, like dialysis clinics, are less affected by [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_various_sectors | inflation]] as they can raise prices due to inelastic demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Companies (e.g., Samic, Autogrill):** While more vulnerable to economic downturns, some cyclical businesses like cruise ship interior suppliers (Samic) or airport/highway restaurants (Autogrill) can present interesting opportunities if they are undervalued and recovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:52">[02:52:52]</a>.
*   **REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts):** REITs, which invest in real estate, can also do well during [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:18">[03:04:18]</a>.

### Speculative Assets

Assets described as "meme stocks" (e.g., GameStop, AMC), cloud software companies, disruptive technology companies, and cryptocurrencies are viewed as areas of market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. These assets are often highly speculative, with high volatility and leverage, and may be particularly susceptible to market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:35">[03:41:35]</a>. Michael Burry warned about the speculative nature of such assets, including Bitcoin, noting the significant leverage involved and the lack of regulation compared to traditional stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:32">[03:46:32]</a>.

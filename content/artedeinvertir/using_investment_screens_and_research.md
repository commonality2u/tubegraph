Investing with a small amount of capital offers a significant structural advantage, according to Warren Buffett, who stated that with less than a million dollars, annual returns of up to 50% are achievable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This contrasts sharply with managing large fortunes, where returns tend to decrease over time; Buffett himself notes that 10% is a good result for his current level of assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## The Advantage of Small Capital

When working with a small sum, the universe of potential investments expands significantly, offering thousands of possibilities for investing smaller amounts like ten thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This is because larger funds face liquidity issues and cannot easily invest in smaller companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

### Where to Look for Opportunities

To find these high-return opportunities, investors must:
*   **Invest time and effort:** Opportunities do not simply appear; they require diligent searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Focus on small companies (small caps):** While over 30,000 companies are listed in the US, only about 500 are in the S&P index, which are heavily analyzed and offer limited extraordinary returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. The other 29,500 companies, often "local businesses" or those "off the map," are less known and provide fertile ground for finding undervalued assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

## The Importance of Knowledge and Preparation

Warren Buffett advises aspiring investors to learn as much as possible about all kinds of stocks and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. He emphasizes that in the stock market, "luck does not exist; it is simply the combination of opportunity and preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Without adequate preparation, one cannot identify and seize opportunities when they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

### Tools for Research

Historically, investors like Buffett would pore over "Moody's manuals," thick books containing detailed information on listed companies, including historical prices, P/E ratios, sales, benefits, and shares in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

Today, similar information is readily available on free online platforms such as Yahoo Finance or Morningstar.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. Additionally, modern "screens" (computer tools) allow investors to filter the entire stock market by various parameters, such as a low P/E, specific growth rates, or profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### A Structured Approach to Research

To begin your [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | investment education and strategies]]:
1.  **Choose an attractive industry:** Consider sectors like health, IT, technology, or transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
2.  **Learn extensively about that sector:** Start by reading reports from the largest companies, as they often provide the most detailed insights into how the industry operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
3.  **Search for smaller companies within that sector:** Once you have a foundational understanding, look for undervalued opportunities among less-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Case Studies in Finding Value

### Humanice (2016)

The True fund, while managing a relatively small 9 million euros, invested in Humanice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. This micro-company, with a capitalization of only 30 million euros, was largely ignored by analysts and investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Humanice was a sound business with low debt, trading at €1.50 per share, with projected earnings of €1 per share for the following year, resulting in a P/E ratio of less than two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. The fund accumulated a position of approximately one million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Three years later, the shares traded at €6, a four-fold increase from the purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Korean Stocks (2004)

In 2004, Warren Buffett received a book on Korean stocks and spent several hours scanning it for cheap opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He found intriguing prospects, such as Daesung Flour Mill, which controlled 25% of the flour market in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This company had stable earnings and significant investments per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. Trading at 38,000 won, it was valued at roughly twice its profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Buffett invested $100 million across 20 such Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Daesung Flour Mill's stock quickly appreciated to almost 240,000 won, multiplying his [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Key Takeaway: Focus on Undervalued Investments

To generate extraordinary returns, it is essential to focus on [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | investments]] that are "very, very cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. For example, if a stock trades at $10 but earns $1 per share, it has a P/E of 10, likely yielding around a 10% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. However, finding a stock earning $1 per share but trading at $2 (a P/E of 2) could theoretically yield a 50% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

These types of opportunities have always existed in markets and will continue to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Success requires illusion, passion, curiosity, hard work, and a willingness to approach [[investment_advice_and_strategies_from_top_investors | investment strategies and portfolio management]] differently from most investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

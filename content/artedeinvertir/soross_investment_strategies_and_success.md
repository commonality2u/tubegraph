George Soros, a renowned [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | investor]], has generated a significant portion of his wealth through the theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Since founding his fund in 1970, he has achieved average annual returns of 25% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Notably, Soros has navigated major market crises, including those in 1987, 1990, the dot-com bubble, 2008, and 2011, often emerging strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Early Life and Philosophical Roots

Soros's unique approach to [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investment]] is deeply rooted in his personal history and academic background <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. Born a Hungarian refugee during World War II, he and his family, though middle-class, managed to falsify papers to allow him to enter the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. With some financial means, he gained access to the London Business School, a highly respected institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

His true passion, as he states, is philosophy, not [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. A key mentor was Karl Popper, whose teachings inspired Soros to merge [[the_impact_of_philosophy_on_soross_investment_approach | philosophy]] with [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment]], giving rise to his theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. After graduating, Soros faced significant challenges finding work in a xenophobic society, taking odd jobs like door-to-door sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. He eventually entered the financial world through a contact with a fellow Hungarian at a financial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

## Evolution of Investment Style

Initially, Soros invested in "cheap stocks," a style similar to what is sometimes called "ball best in peace" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>. However, over time, his [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | philosophy]] evolved from a value-oriented approach to one focused on speculation, seeking greater profits in different market segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. He gained a strong reputation by identifying undervalued German stocks, particularly those with dual structures (common and preferred shares) during the 1950s and 60s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. His successful reports for clients led to their support in founding his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>.

## The Quantum Fund and Organic Growth

Soros founded what would become the Quantum Fund with just $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>. This fund eventually managed assets exceeding $30 billion to $40 billion, becoming "gigantic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Remarkably, most of this growth was organic, as the fund eventually stopped accepting external clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:03:57]</a>. This demonstrates the power of compound interest applied over decades of consistent returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## The Alchemy of Finance and Reflexivity

Soros's core [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | philosophy]] is articulated in his book, "The Alchemy of Finance," written in 1988-1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. The speaker notes it is a very complex book that requires "quite deep knowledge of finance" and years of [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investing]] experience to fully grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a>.

The theory of reflexivity posits that the financial system, being a human construct, means that financial crises cannot be predicted with the same certainty as natural phenomena like weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. This is because the participants themselves, whether large or small [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | investors]], influence the market they observe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>. This concept echoes quantum theory's idea that the observer influences the observed element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

### Core Tenets of Reflexivity:
*   **Unstable Markets**: Markets are not stable; they are always biased either upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>.
*   **Rejection of Efficient Markets**: Soros contends that the theory of efficient markets is "nonsense" because participants act based on emotions, feelings, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.
*   **Perception vs. Reality**: The theory highlights a divergence between perception (red line) and economic reality or asset price (blue line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. This perception can, at times, become a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

### The Reflective Process (Boom/Bust Cycle)
Soros's theory often explains boom and bust patterns, or "bubbles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
1.  **Initial Perception Shift**: People begin to perceive an asset (e.g., housing, a currency, a sector) as a good [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:08:00">[10:08:00]</a>. The market price initially lags, but once this new reality is identified, it tends to rise much faster than the underlying fundamentals suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:43:00">[10:43:00]</a>.
2.  **Test Period**: A period occurs where prices stabilize or even fall slightly, testing the perceived reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>. If confidence is regained, viewing the dip as a "buying opportunity," prices can experience another significant rally, often surpassing previous highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. This reinforces the perception, and the modified reality (e.g., increased orders, benefits) further drives prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.
3.  **New Paradigm/Disconnection**: The bubble reaches a point where prices become completely disconnected from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a>.
4.  **Irreversible Fall**: At this stage, even small pieces of news or minor events can trigger massive, irreversible falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. For [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | example]], the dot-com bubble's peak coincided with Bill Gates stating Microsoft shares were overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. Even as prices plummet, the underlying fundamentals may still carry some inertia, but the fall continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a>. This is a dangerous phase where "bargain hunters" might misinterpret the situation, believing a repeat of the test period will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a>.

## Practical Examples of Reflexivity

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 crisis provides a clear [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | example]] of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. Despite the S&P 500 plummeting by 58% and companies continuing to report weak results into 2009, the market began to rise in March 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:30:00">[15:30:00]</a>. This contradicted traditional theory that the market anticipates events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. Instead, as the S&P began to recover, major [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | investors]], central bankers, and corporations regained confidence. This led to new [[longterm_investment_strategies | investments]], share buybacks, and liquidity injections, stimulating the economy and restoring credit flow, even though GDP contraction wasn't disastrous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:44:00">[16:44:00]</a>. The market's perception *created* the improved reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>.

### Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs)
A more recent [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | example]] is the behavior of Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a>. When they began listing in Spain, housing prices were starting to recover, but the market was hesitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>. These [[examples_of_successful_small_company_investments | companies]] often listed at book value but quickly began trading at a premium (e.g., 1x or 2x book value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:07:00">[19:07:00]</a>. This premium allowed the REITs to issue new shares at an inflated price (e.g., 1.2x book value) and acquire new assets in the private market at book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a>. This process was accretive, increasing earnings per share, which further boosted investor confidence and justified higher valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:51:00">[19:51:00]</a>. This created a "new paradigm" where SOCIMIs were seen as growth [[examples_of_successful_small_company_investments | companies]], driving prices even higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. However, recent periods of declining confidence and a falling Ibex have caused these shares to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a>. When a REIT issues capital at prices below book value, it has the inverse effect, diluting earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>, signaling a dangerous situation to avoid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

## Soros's Asset Classes and Defensive Application

Soros typically operates in four to five main asset classes: common stocks, currencies of liquid countries, index futures, gold, and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. His understanding of reflexivity is not only for speculation but also for protection against certain market events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:00">[22:15:00]</a>. In managing an [[longterm_investment_strategies | investment fund]], for [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | example]], while holding growth [[examples_of_successful_small_company_investments | companies]] that acquire others (like the SOCIMIs), it's crucial that this growth is financed by the company's own cash flow and benefits, rather than through capital increases that can create vicious circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:00">[22:37:00]</a>.

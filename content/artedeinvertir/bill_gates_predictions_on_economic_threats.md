[[Bill Gates]] has recently issued a warning about a new threat that he believes could endanger the world and the global economy, potentially being worse than the recent crisis experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In response, he has significantly adjusted his investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>.

## Background: Bill Gates' Predictive Acumen

[[Bill Gates]] is recognized as one of the wealthiest and most influential individuals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. His insights into future crises and economic trends have proven to be notably accurate.

### Past Pandemic Prediction
In 2019, [[Bill Gates]] foreshadowed a crisis similar to one the world would later experience, though his warnings were largely unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He also predicted how that crisis might be resolved, again without widespread attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. This historical accuracy underpins the significance of his current warnings.

### Investment Track Record
[[Bill Gates]] has demonstrated exceptional foresight in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He invested in the early stages of companies like Novavax and BioNTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. He even predicted that Pfizer, alongside BioNTech, would be the first to develop a solution to the "current problem" (likely referring to the COVID-19 pandemic) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

While [[Bill Gates]] founded Microsoft, its shares now constitute only 2% of his total assets, as he has extensively diversified his wealth into other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. His deep understanding of the economy and technology has historically led to a high success rate in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Current Economic Concerns

During the annual security conference in Munich, [[Bill Gates]] was asked about his primary concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He responded by stating that "it is certain that we will have another pandemic in the future, only this time it will be with a different pathogen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. This highlights a persistent concern about global health threats.

### The "New Threat": Bioterrorism
Beyond future pandemics, [[Bill Gates]] has expressed significant worry about specific "terrorist attacks related to smallpox strains" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He believes these could be spread massively in public places like airports, stadiums, or shopping centers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. He has urged governments to establish a common fund of over $1 billion annually for monitoring and controlling this risk, citing potential severe effects on society and the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Broader Economic Worries
In an interview with CNBC, [[Bill Gates]] provided further insights into his cautious stance on the economy:
*   He is concerned that "we may have not yet seen the worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.
*   He worries about "people's distrust in governments," noting that future crises would require decisive action within "less than 6 months instead of 2 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   He also suggested that "social networks must be regulated since they are contributing to generating division in society and in the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

These concerns suggest a belief that societal divisions and eroding trust could hinder effective crisis response, adding to economic instability.

## [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | Bill Gates' Portfolio Changes and Strategies]]

[[Bill Gates]] has taken decisive action with his investments in response to these identified risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Due to stock market transparency rules in the United States, major investors' portfolio movements are public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. His recent report shows he has sold 12 of the 18 shares in his portfolio and has not purchased any new ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

### Significant Share Sales

#### Cyclical Companies
He has specifically focused on selling shares in cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These companies are highly sensitive to economic cycles and tend to fall sharply when economic problems emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

#### Technology Sector
[[Bill Gates]] has reduced his exposure to technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   He sold all his Google shares, leading to a more than 25% plummet in the stock in under 45 days after his sale was reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   His only remaining technology holding is Microsoft, which constitutes barely 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This proved wise as the Nasdaq technology index fell over 30% in the first five months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   Last year, he also divested all his Alibaba shares when they were trading at $225 per share, just before they fell to less than $90 a year later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

#### Transportation Sector
He has sold shares related to the transportation sector, including UPS and FedEx, two of the largest global transport companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He also sold his shares in Canadian Pacific Railway, a major rail transport company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

#### Betting Against Tesla
[[Bill Gates]] has reportedly started betting against Tesla shares, a company founded by Elon Musk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Despite being a proponent of climate change action and renewable energies, he reportedly dislikes Tesla shares and its founder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While he drives an electric car, it is a Porsche Taycan, not a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Tesla shares have plummeted over 50% on the stock market recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. One potential reason for this decision is the high valuation Tesla shares reached, trading at over 50 times earnings compared to a market average of 16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. This aligns with his past experience with Microsoft's valuation during the 2000 tech bubble, where high valuations led to significant drops despite continued profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

#### Walmart Sale
Another successful recent move was selling shares of Walmart, which collapsed on the stock market due to supply chain issues and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

### Strategic Holdings: Defensive Sectors
Despite his concerns, [[Bill Gates]] remains invested in specific, predictable, and defensive sectors to counter inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. These companies are expected to be least affected by an economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

#### Ecolab (Water Treatment)
[[Bill Gates]] has maintained his investment in Ecolab (ECL), a company specializing in water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. Ecolab benefits from a high competitive advantage based on reputation and long-standing operation, making it resistant to new competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The company has multiplied its value by over 20 times in the last 20 years and has consistently grown earnings per share at over 10% annually, even performing well during crises like 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Its shares have fallen over 30% recently, but are expected to benefit from new regulations on water treatment, with projected annual growth rates exceeding 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings for the next 12 months is positive compared to its 5-year average of 33 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

#### Waste Management (Garbage Collection)
Another favored holding is Waste Management (WM), the leading garbage collection company in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This sector is considered predictable, traditional, and crisis-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. The company is set to benefit from the growing trend of waste recycling and environmental respect, with the recycling market in North America expected to grow at 9% in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Waste Management has multiplied its value by over 60 times due to its competitive advantage in controlling regional areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Despite recent market downturns, its shares have been resilient, falling only about 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.

#### Coca-Cola FEMSA (Beverage Bottling)
[[Bill Gates]] has also kept shares of Coca-Cola FEMSA, the national bottler of Coca-Cola for Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This is another highly defensive and predictable business, aligning with his conservative investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

#### Canadian Pacific (Rail Transport)
Shares of Canadian Pacific are also still held in his investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Farmland Accumulation
Outside of the stock market, [[Bill Gates]] has made a significant move by massively accumulating farmland, becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. This strategy proved highly successful just before the recent rise in food prices and global inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[Bill Gates]]' recent actions and statements reflect a deep concern for future economic and societal stability, driven by potential new pandemics, bioterrorism threats, and a perceived erosion of trust in institutions. His [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment strategy]] has shifted to a highly defensive posture, divesting from cyclical and most technology stocks, and holding onto companies in stable, essential sectors like water treatment and waste management, alongside significant real asset accumulation like farmland. This cautious, yet strategic, approach aims to preserve capital and navigate anticipated future challenges.

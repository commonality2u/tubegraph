Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, currently the world's largest hedge fund, has made notable statements regarding the global economy, including the [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us|rise of China]] and its potential impact on markets [00:00:09]. His views are significant due to Bridgewater's predictable returns and influence in the market [03:30:17].

## Ray Dalio's Key Factors

Ray Dalio identified three major problems for the global economy and stock market, with the first directly addressing China's growing influence:
1.  The [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us|rise of China]] and the Yuan as an alternative currency to the dollar [03:45:34].
2.  Economic inequality between rich and poor classes [06:01:41].
3.  The unprecedented financial experiment of extensive money printing [08:03:00].

These three factors combined could generate significant market friction in the future [08:56:06].

### The Rise of China and the Yuan
Dalio notes that the dynamic of a rising China and the Yuan as an alternative currency to the dollar is similar to the shift at the beginning of the century when the United States took economic hegemony from the British pound [03:50:09]. China's GDP is projected to surpass that of the United States by 2026-2027, making it the largest economy in the world [04:01:45]. This shift could lead to a paradigm change in the global economic order [04:12:00].

The dollar's role as the world's reserve currency has allowed the US to print large amounts of money without significant immediate harm, unlike countries such as Venezuela or Argentina, which experience massive inflation when doing so [04:20:47]. However, the declining market share of the dollar, which was 66% in 2014 but has since fallen, suggests people are losing confidence in it due to continuous printing and the emergence of alternatives like the Yuan, Yen, and Euro [05:27:06]. This decline could mean the US may no longer be able to print money freely without generating inflation [05:50:19].

### China as a Growth Region
As the US loses its theoretical hegemony, China and the broader Asian region are expected to see the greatest economic growth, characterized by lower taxes and a more pro-capitalist attitude [05:01:00]. This makes Asian stocks an interesting area for future investment [05:11:45].

## Investment Opportunities in China/Asia
Several companies operating within or related to the Chinese/Asian market were highlighted as potential investment opportunities due to their growth prospects and resilience.

### Alibaba
While not much new development has occurred, Alibaba is a company that is often held in investment portfolios, with some recent additional purchases [06:04:04].

### Samsung Electronics
Samsung Electronics is a major company in the Asian region expected to experience significant future growth [06:30:57]. Korean stocks like Samsung were historically cheap due to poor shareholder treatment (e.g., not buying back shares or issuing dividends), but this has changed over the last four to five years, leading to market recognition [06:40:02].

Samsung's primary revenue comes from microchips, specifically the manufacturing of RAM memory, rather than phones or electronics [06:47:04]. The world is currently experiencing a tremendous shortage of microchips due to confinement, leading to record sales for companies like Samsung [06:54:19]. This tight market situation is estimated to last between one and two years [07:30:57].

Samsung's earnings per share are estimated to be around 8,000 Korean won for the next year, trading at approximately 10 times earnings [07:52:16]. Compared to competitors like Micron, Samsung appears cheaper due to its high liquidity [08:44:02].

### Caixa (Chinese Property Management Services)
Caixa Property Management Services (Caixa Stock Holding) is a Chinese company within a sector that is expected to experience significant growth [01:37:15]. This company offers services such as gardening, cleaning, security, and maintenance of air conditioning systems for buildings [01:39:43]. The sector is experiencing a "tailwind" due to China's growing population, strong GDP growth, and government regulations that encourage building owners to hire professional management companies [01:53:35].

Caixa's sales have grown substantially, from 600 million to 2900 million [01:38:31]. Despite this growth, it is listed at around 10 times earnings and once sales, which is considered a reasonable valuation compared to higher-valued technology companies [01:38:48]. The company aims to achieve 8 Hong Kong dollars in earnings per share in the next three to four years, making it an interesting prospect [01:39:10]. Investing in Hong Kong carries no special risk, as China is interested in Hong Kong maintaining its current economic path [01:41:32].

## Economic Impact of China's Rise
The [[economic_impact_of_the_new_world_order|economic impact of the new world order]] arising from China's increasing influence means a potential shift in global economic dynamics. The Yuan's rise as an alternative currency could challenge the dollar's dominance, affecting global debt and trade [03:48:00]. This shift also influences investment strategies, with a greater focus on growth opportunities in Asia [05:04:09].

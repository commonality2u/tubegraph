[[Warren Buffetts current investment moves | Warren Buffett]] initiated his first major investment of 2020 by investing $10 billion in a new sector, taking advantage of favorable prices offered by the prevailing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. Previously, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] had signaled caution, refraining from major investments and selling off his entire position in airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Investment Details
This significant investment was made in the energy sector, which is currently "one of the least appreciated by the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. This move aligns with one of [[Warren Buffetts Investment Tips | Warren Buffett's investment advice]]: "be greedy when others are greedy and vice versa" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, as the energy sector is currently experiencing significant investor fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Specifically, [[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Warren Buffett]] acquired Dominion Energy's natural gas transportation assets for $10 billion, a figure that includes $6 billion in assumed debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Upon the announcement of this deal, Dominion's shares dropped over 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, reflecting market sentiment that selling to [[Warren Buffetts investment portfolio | Warren Buffett]] might not be the most advantageous deal for the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. This acquisition means [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] now controls 18% of all natural gas transportation lines in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Strategic Preference for Natural Gas Transportation
[[Warren Buffetts latest investment moves | Warren Buffett]] chose to invest in the natural gas sector in a "much safer way" by purchasing transportation assets, rather than direct production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

This strategy is based on key differences between gas extractors and transportation companies:
*   **Natural Gas Extractors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>:
    *   Face high fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   Do not control the sale price of their product, as it depends on stock market listing prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
    *   Suffer from a lack of predictability, hindering stock market prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Gas Pipeline and Transportation Companies** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
    *   Charge clients a fixed rate for pipeline usage or based on volume transported, irrespective of gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.
    *   Often operate as local monopolies, as securing multiple licenses for main transportation lines is difficult for competing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This monopolistic nature generally leads to better stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> and high dividend payouts to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

## Reasons for Interest in the Natural Gas Sector
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett's]] interest in this asset class stems from two primary reasons:
1.  **U.S. Production and Export Growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>: Due to advancements in fracking and shale gas technology, the U.S. has become the world's largest natural gas producer, producing more than it consumes domestically. Plans include exporting this low-cost gas, which necessitates extensive gas transportation lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
2.  **Cleaner Energy Transition** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>: Natural gas is a cheaper and cleaner energy source compared to coal or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. It is projected to have significant growth in the energy economy over the next two decades, supporting the transition to more environmentally friendly energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

## Historical Context: Petrochina
In 2002, when an indicator for the energy sector was at its lowest point relative to the S&P 500, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] made a significant investment in the energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He purchased $500 million in shares of the oil company Petrochina. In under five years, this investment multiplied eightfold, reaching a value of $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. This type of operation has earned him the moniker "Oracle of Omaha," as he is often among the first to capitalize on favorable market prices in sectors where fear is still prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in the Natural Gas Sector
Following [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett's]] lead, several investment opportunities exist in natural gas transportation and storage companies due to their stable business models, attractive valuations, good future prospects, and high dividend distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)
Kinder Morgan, listed under the ticker KMI at $14 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>, is the largest natural gas transportation company in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. The founding family retains a 14% stake, valued at over $5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

*   **Business Model Resilience**: Despite recent declines in natural gas prices, Kinder Morgan's contracts are largely insulated. Only 2% of their contracts depend on gas prices; the rest are fixed-rate or volume-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. The key factor for these companies is gas consumption, which is highly resilient, even during crises, as it's an essential good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.
*   **Financial Stability**: The company projects a modest 6% profit decline for the current year, attributed to lower consumption during confinement months rather than gas price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: In 2014, Kinder Morgan traded at $40 per share with $4.6 billion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. Six years later, profits remain $4.6 billion, yet shares trade at $14, reflecting a shift from market euphoria to pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.
    *   For the current year, the company expects to earn $2 per share, distributing $1 as a dividend, resulting in a 7% annual dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
    *   Historically, gas pipeline shares trade at an average of 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>. Using this multiple, a target price of $30 per share can be estimated, potentially rising to $40 over the years as profits or dividends increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

### Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP)
Cheniere Energy Partners, listed under the ticker CQP at $33 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>, specializes in natural gas storage and export assets in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.
*   **Strategic Role**: The company's facilities are crucial for converting natural gas from a gaseous to a liquid state for export, supporting the U.S. plan to export its surplus gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.
*   **Monopoly Advantage**: Similar to gas pipelines, obtaining and holding licenses for gas export terminals is extremely complex, leading to monopolistic positions that typically perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>.
*   **Stability and Growth**: Global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to continue increasing, benefiting this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
    *   80.5% of its contracts are at fixed rates with an average duration of 19 years, providing strong income stability and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.
    *   Clients include solvent major energy companies like Iberdrola, Total, and Endesa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.
    *   The company was unaffected by the current crisis, increasing its dividend payment in the first two quarters of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>.
    *   Profits are projected to increase by 5-10% year-over-year, with an annual dividend yield of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Stable and predictable companies like Cheniere Energy Partners usually trade above $15 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. The company estimates profits could reach almost $4 per share within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
    *   A 3-year target price of $60 per share is calculated (4 multiplied by 15), plus approximately $8 in collected dividends over the same period, totaling $68 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>. With current trading at $33 per share, this indicates significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.

Given these factors, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett's]] interest in the energy sector, particularly natural gas transportation and storage, is not surprising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>.

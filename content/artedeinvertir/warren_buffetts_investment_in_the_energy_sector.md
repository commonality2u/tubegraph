[[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] made his first major investment of 2020, taking advantage of favorable prices during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He invested $10 billion in a new sector with promising future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## First Major Investment of 2020

Prior to this, [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] had sent a message of caution, making no major investments and selling his entire position in airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Many wondered why he wasn't capitalizing on good stock market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. His first significant investment arrived in the energy sector, which was surprising to many as it is currently one of the least appreciated by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

## Strategic Rationale: Counter-Cyclical Investing

With this new investment, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] is applying a core piece of advice for successful investing: "be greedy when others are fearful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The energy sector is currently experiencing significant fear among investors, leading to attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

A Bloomberg graph illustrates the behavior of the energy sector (raw materials) relative to the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. When this index is high, investing in raw materials or energy is more dangerous; when it is low (like in the 1970s or early 2000s), it is more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. In 2019, this index was at its lowest compared to the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

## Historical Precedent: Petrochina

In 2002, when this indicator was also at its lowest, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] made a significant investment in the energy sector by purchasing shares in the oil company Petrochina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He invested $500 million and multiplied his investment eightfold in under five years, reaching a value of $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This type of operation earned him the moniker "Oracle of Omaha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Dominion Energy Acquisition Details

[[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] recently purchased Dominion Energy's natural gas transportation assets for $10 billion, which included $6 billion in the form of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. When the agreement was announced, Dominion shares fell over 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, as the market interprets selling to [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] as potentially not a good deal for the seller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] chose to invest in natural gas transportation assets, such as pipelines and storage terminals, which he views as a safer approach than investing directly in natural gas producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Why Natural Gas Transportation?

Natural gas extractors face two primary issues: high fixed costs and no control over the sale price, which depends on stock exchange listings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. This lack of predictability hinders their prosperity in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

In contrast, gas pipeline and transportation companies have key advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>:
*   They charge clients a fixed rate for pipeline use or based on volume transported, not on the gas's quoted price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.
*   They tend to be local monopolies, as governments rarely grant second licenses for main transportation lines, making competition difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. Monopolies typically perform well in the stock market and pay high dividends to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

With this transaction, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]] now controls 18% of all natural gas transportation lines in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

### Reasons for Interest in this Asset Class

There are two main reasons for [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]]'s interest in this sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:
1.  **U.S. as a Producer**: Thanks to fracking and shale gas technology, the U.S. has become the world's largest producer of natural gas, producing more than it consumes domestically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. Its plans include exporting this low-cost gas, which requires extensive transportation lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.
2.  **Energy Transition**: Natural gas is a cheaper and cleaner energy source than coal or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. It is projected to have the greatest growth in the economy over the next two decades, facilitating the transition to more environmentally friendly energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in the Sector

Investment opportunities in natural gas transportation and storage stocks are attractive due to their sound business models, appealing valuations, strong future prospects, and high dividend distributions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)

Kinder Morgan (KMI), listed at $14 per share, is the largest natural gas transportation company in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. The founding family still owns 14% of the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. Despite recent drops in natural gas prices, these companies are insulated because their contracts are based on pipeline usage or volume transported, with only 2% of Kinder Morgan's contracts depending on gas price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

For gas transportation companies, the key factor is gas consumption, not its price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Energy consumption, including natural gas, is resilient even during crises as it is an essential good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>. Kinder Morgan expects profits to fall by a modest 6% this year, primarily due to lower consumption during confinement months, not gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

In 2014, Kinder Morgan shares traded at $40 with $4.6 billion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Six years later, profits remain the same, but shares trade at $14 due to a shift from euphoria to pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

For this year, the company expects to earn $2 per share and distribute $1 as a dividend, resulting in a 7% annual dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Historically, gas pipeline shares have traded at an average of 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Based on this, a target price of $30 per share (2 multiplied by 15) is derived, potentially expanding to $40 over years as dividends are paid or profits increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.

### Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP)

Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP), listed at $33 per share, is dedicated to natural gas transportation and storage, specifically owning assets for storage and export <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. As the U.S. plans to export excess domestic gas, it must be converted from a gaseous to a liquid state, which this company's facilities handle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.

Obtaining licenses for gas export terminals is extremely complex, and once obtained, it's difficult for the government to grant a second license for competition, fostering monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. These storage and gas processing companies tend to perform well in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. Global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to increase, benefiting this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

Like Kinder Morgan, Cheniere Energy Partners has 80.5% of its contracts at fixed rates with an average duration of 19 years, providing significant income stability and visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:01">[00:16:01]</a>. Clients are highly solvent, including major energy companies like Iberdrola, Total, and Endesa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. The company has not been affected by the current crisis and even increased its dividend payment during the first two quarters of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>.

The company expects profits to increase by 5% to 10% this year compared to the previous year and will pay an annual dividend equivalent to 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>. Stable and predictable companies like this typically trade above 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. The company estimates profits could reach almost $4 per share within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. Multiplying $4 by a 15x multiple gives a 3-year target price of $60 per share, plus nearly $8 in collected dividends over the same period, totaling $68 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Currently, shares are trading at $33 with a 7% dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:26">[00:17:26]</a>.

Given these factors, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]]'s interest in this new sector is not surprising, considering its inherent characteristics and the attractive valuations offered by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.

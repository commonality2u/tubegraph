Renowned investor Michael Burry has shared his perspective on the stock market's future, with other investors like Daniel Loeb also weighing in on the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. The current economic climate is significantly shaped by [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] and [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_market | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Market Decline: The Role of Multiple Compression and Interest Rates
In the first half of the year, the S&P 500 fell by 25% to 26% when adjusted for [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]], and the Nasdaq dropped by 30% to 35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This decline is largely attributed to "multiple compression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

Stock prices are determined by two main variables: a company's earnings per share and its valuation multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. While earnings can fluctuate, the valuation multiple also goes up and down based on market sentiment, economic conditions, future prospects, and [[impact_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_the_economy | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Currently, both the perception of the future (due to [[inflation_and_interest_rates_impact | inflation]] and uncertainty) and the [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_market | interest rate]] situation are negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. If the minimum rate of return set by the central bank is too high, shares must trade at a lower valuation multiple, causing them to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

According to JP Morgan data for the first half of the year:
*   Company profits grew by 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   Valuation multiples compressed by 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   This led to an overall S&P 500 decline of -21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Historically, valuation multiples tend to contract after periods of euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

## Impact of Rising Interest Rates and Inflation
Michael Burry anticipates a second phase of market decline driven by the compression of corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This is fueled by the near-certainty of a U.S. recession and high [[the_influence_of_inflation_on_investment_portfolios | inflation]] (9.1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

A significant event expected to cause market "earthquakes" is the Federal Reserve's monthly meeting on July 26th-27th, where a 75 or even 100 basis point [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_market | interest rate]] hike is anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Higher [[role_of_interest_rates_and_inflation_in_investments | interest rates]] increase the cost of money for indebted companies and new projects, negatively impacting them, along with [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | energy inflation]] and other costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

### Corporate Profit Decline in Recessions
During economic recessions or market corrections, corporate profits typically fall. The median figure for profit decline in such periods is 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. In a mild recession, profits might only fall by 9-10%, while a more severe recession could see them drop by 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Michael Burry suggests the market is "halfway through the fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>. If the S&P 500's normalized earnings per share are $225, a 20% drop (mild recession) would bring it to $180, and a severe recession to $175 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Based on current P/E ratios, this could imply an S&P 500 target of 2800 points from its current 3600-3700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. In extreme scenarios, reminiscent of the 2008 crisis, the S&P 500 could potentially drop to 1400 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>.

## Sectoral Impact in a Recession
Different sectors behave differently during recessions, and corporate profits are reduced most in certain areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>:
*   **Materials Sector**: Suffers significantly, with producers like copper, aluminum, and steel collapsing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
*   **Discretionary Consumption**: Items like cars, houses, or large appliances see reduced purchases as consumers delay large expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>.
*   **Financial Sector**: Tends to suffer greatly when there are economic downturns and banks lower economic plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.
*   **Energy Sector**: Despite recent popularity among investors, it also tends to suffer during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.
*   **Technology**: While less affected by profit decreases, it experiences multiple compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>.
*   **Utilities**: Companies involved in electricity generation often see increased profits during recessions, acting as defensive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: Generally stable, as health issues require attention regardless of economic conditions, leading to increased profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>.

Copper prices are often considered a leading indicator of recession, as its collapse tends to precede a slowdown in U.S. employment growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>.

## Consumer Sentiment and Market Performance
Consumer sentiment is currently at its lowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:30">[02:30:30]</a>. Historically, very low periods of consumer sentiment have consistently led to recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:58">[02:39:58]</a>. However, these periods of extreme negativity have also historically been the best times to invest in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

When consumer sentiment is negative, the S&P 500 has yielded significant annual returns in the subsequent 12 months:
*   1980: +20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:40">[02:47:40]</a>
*   October 1990: +29% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:04">[02:55:04]</a>
*   2008 Crisis: Strong positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:46">[02:59:46]</a>
*   April 2020: +43% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:46">[02:59:46]</a>

Conversely, periods of market euphoria and high consumer sentiment often precede negative returns:
*   January 2000: -2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>
*   January 2015: -27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:51">[02:56:51]</a>

This counter-intuitive behavior occurs because when sentiment changes and [[inflation_expectations_and_their_impact_on_investments | business profits]] go up, the market is encouraged, and the valuation multiple expands, creating a multiplier effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:57">[02:53:57]</a>.

## Professional Investor Positioning
Fund managers are currently positioned with very low equity futures in American stocks, indicating high negativity among professional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:56">[03:55:56]</a>. This contrasts with April-May 2020, when the market was performing well, but professionals were least invested due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:56">[03:59:56]</a>. Retail investors, however, continued to invest during that time and were ultimately proven right <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

## Investor Insights
### Daniel Loeb's Perspective
Daniel Loeb, an activist investor, notes that the rules of the game are changing in the market, shifting favored sectors, opportunities, and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:48">[03:56:48]</a>. He cautions that there won't be a loud alarm when market conditions improve, but rather a "small high-pitched whistle" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:58">[04:06:58]</a>. Investors cannot wait for everything to be perfect to invest; risks and volatility must be assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:58">[04:42:58]</a>. Loeb's portfolio includes defensive companies with growth like utilities and healthcare, as well as companies that can benefit from [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]], such as energy and materials producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:02">[04:14:02]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Recent Moves
Warren Buffett is actively taking advantage of the current situation, deploying liquidity through significant purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:17">[04:33:17]</a>. His latest focus is Occidental Petroleum, an oil extraction and exploration company, in which he has invested $10 billion and now owns 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.

Buffett's interest in Occidental Petroleum stems from its very low oil extraction costs (as low as $30 per barrel in regions like the Permian Basin), which allows the company to prosper even if oil prices decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:55">[01:05:55]</a>. This strategy mirrors his past successful investment in PetroChina in 2002, when he bought shares at three times earnings during a period of rising [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:49">[01:09:49]</a>. Occidental Petroleum, like PetroChina, also focuses on returning money to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:49">[01:10:49]</a>. The company is currently trading at approximately six times earnings, below the sector average of 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a>. Buffett's moves suggest an expectation that [[inflation_and_interest_rates_impact | inflation]] may persist longer than expected due to oil factors, and he wants exposure to that market with a strong company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:40">[01:11:40]</a>.

## Conclusion: Opportunities Amidst Volatility
The current period, marked by high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] and aggressive [[impact_of_interest_rate_changes_on_the_market | interest rate]] hikes, presents both risks and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:47">[00:34:47]</a>. The market is currently in a "time to sow" and accumulate assets, especially in areas with depressed valuations and strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:39">[02:22:39]</a>. While the market is experiencing volatility, investors like Warren Buffett and Daniel Loeb are finding value in specific sectors and companies, emphasizing the importance of independent analysis and understanding a company's underlying business model and its capacity to generate cash flow in varying economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:19">[01:17:19]</a>.

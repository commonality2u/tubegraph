In an economic scenario characterized by `stagflation`, defined as inflation coupled with a lack of economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>, even the world's best investor, [[warren_buffetts_investment_advice | Warren Buffett]], has recommended a series of guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. These tips are considered useful for navigating such a complex economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett's]] Core Recommendations for Economic Volatility

[[warren_buffetts_investment_principles | Warren Buffett]], in an interview published by CNBC and Business Insider, discussed his [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | investment style]] for periods of high inflation or low economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. He offered two main pieces of advice:

### 1. Invest in Yourself
[[warren_buffetts_investment_advice | Warren Buffett]] personally recommends that individuals invest in themselves and their abilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. He states that if you are the best in your profession—whether a teacher, surgeon, or plumber—you will always secure your share of the national economy, regardless of the currency's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. In an inflationary environment, a highly demanded professional will be able to raise their prices or salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This personal investment protects against inflation at a personal level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

>[!TIP] **The Power of Knowledge**
>The speaker emphasizes that knowledge gives power in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>. Without it, even thousands of opportunities are useless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. Investment in oneself, through training and continuous learning, pays off in the economic future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a>. Even discovering a new 5% of knowledge can multiply annual returns significantly over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:17">[00:25:17]</a>.

### 2. Own Wonderful Businesses
The second best protection during periods of inflation or economic difficulty is to own "wonderful businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. This refers to extraordinary companies whose products remain in demand even if prices are raised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_investment_principles | Warren Buffett]] navigated the 1980s, a decade with high oil prices, low growth, and war conflicts, with total solvency by focusing on these types of businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:07">[00:27:07]</a>. He achieved high returns, close to 30% per year, without investing in raw materials, oil, or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.

The two key characteristics of "wonderful businesses" are:

#### a. Ability to Easily Increase Prices
Companies should have the ability to easily increase prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>. With inflation, costs rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. If a company lacks a highly demanded product, it cannot raise prices, leading to compressed margins and reduced profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>. Stock prices are closely correlated with current and future profit prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:57">[00:27:57]</a>.

#### b. Ability to Accommodate Growth with Minimum Capital Investments
These businesses should be able to accommodate large increases in revenue with minimum capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This means the company can grow its volume without needing to invest proportionally more in physical assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>.

>[!INFO] **Examples of Wonderful Businesses**
>
>*   **Apple**: People are loyal to Apple products, which are technologically advanced and purchased recurrently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>. Apple is one of [[warren_buffetts_latest_investment_moves | Warren Buffett's]] main investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:44">[00:26:44]</a>.
>*   **Visa/Mastercard**: These companies benefit enormously from inflation without needing significant new investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:26">[00:35:26]</a>.
>*   **Google**: During the 2020 crisis, Google's demand increased, it raised prices, and nearly doubled its profit level without having to double capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
>*   **Moody's**: As a debt rating agency, Moody's operates in an oligopoly and can easily raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a>. With inflation, higher bond issuance volumes increase its income, and its business requires minimal capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:50">[00:30:50]</a>.
>*   **Kraft Heinz**: People continue to consume products like ketchup even if prices rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:58">[00:32:58]</a>. The factory doesn't need additional investment for increased volume, making it resilient to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:13">[00:33:13]</a>.
>*   **Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)**: These companies own real estate assets, such as residential properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>. Housing prices tend to rise with inflation because people need a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>. Maintaining an apartment costs the same regardless of rent increases, allowing them to accommodate higher sales without significant new investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:06">[00:44:06]</a>.
>*   **Businesses Based on Intangibles**: [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_and_insights | Warren Buffett]] has invested in businesses based on intangible assets for decades, such as Coca-Cola (brand, customer loyalty, habit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>. These differ from businesses based on tangible assets, like maritime transport, where client loyalty is low and competition is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Volatile Environments
[[investor_advice_and_insights_from_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett's investment strategy]] is clear and patient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. While his portfolio may go down in the short term like others, sticking to a clear strategy leads to consistent profitability through different economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.

>[!WARNING] **Beware of Chasing Trends**
>When new investment terms are coined (e.g., BRICS in 2007-2008, or "new FANGs" like fossil fuels, aerospace defense, agriculture, nuclear energy, precious metals today), it is often the worst time to invest in those themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This is because consensus drives valuation to its highest point, limiting future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. Chasing short-term performance or trends is part of usual human psychology, but these impulses must be controlled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

Financial markets, when people panic and withdraw money, tend to be positive for the future in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Drops in the stock market are when good returns are generated for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Opportunities arise during market downturns, and being prepared with training and knowledge is essential to take advantage of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.

## Market Insights in the Current Environment
*   **Recession Probability**: Goldman Sachs warned of a 35% probability of an economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Historically, during recessions, market falls tend to be greater than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Oil Prices**: Peaks in oil prices are highly correlated with economic recessions, as seen in 1990, 2000, and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. The year 2020 was an exception due to the black swan event of the virus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.
*   **Yield Curve**: The yield curve, indicating market expectations about the economy, suggests that the usual market drop is within reasonable bounds if there were no recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. Much of the potential fall in a recession scenario (historically 10% on average) seems already discounted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   **Financial Contagion Risk**: The risk of financial contagion remains present, with the Swiss central bank proposing liquidity measures to withstand potential issues from European banks' exposure to the Russian financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>. Premiums for credit default swaps (default insurance) have doubled, indicating market concern about financial contagion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Valuation Multiples**: When inflation is very high, valuation multiples are compressed significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. However, the current situation, with the S&P 500 trading around 18-19 times earnings, does not suggest being in a dangerous "stagflation" scenario like the 1970s where growth was low and inflation very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:55">[00:15:55]</a>.
*   **Geographical Valuations**: European indices have fallen the most due to geographical proximity to the Russian conflict, trading at a significant historical discount compared to American indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Doubt and conflict often reveal good valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:39">[00:19:39]</a>.

## Gold and Real Estate in Inflationary Environments
Historically, in a scenario of `stagflation` (lack of growth with inflation), gold and gold mining companies have performed best, followed by real estate investment companies (REITs) and commodities (oil, materials) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. Gold serves as protection against inflation, not necessarily market crashes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:45">[00:39:45]</a>.

REITs, especially in the health sector or residential properties, are considered predictable and safe because they are non-cyclical and benefit from population aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:04">[00:43:04]</a>. They fulfill [[warren_buffetts_recommendations_for_inflations | Warren Buffett's criteria]]: people need their services and can pay more, and they can accommodate higher sales without significant new investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.

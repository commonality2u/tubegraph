Schrödinger is a [[technological_innovation_and_disruptive_companies | highly innovative company]] that Bill Gates has recently identified as having high growth potential, making it the only new stock he has invested in recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. He invested more than $500 million in the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

## Company Overview

Schrödinger (ticker: SDR) is listed in the US and trades at a price of $71 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. The company operates a new technological platform that assists [[pharmaceutical_sector_investments_by_warren_buffett | pharmaceutical companies]] in developing new drugs or vaccines. This technology allows for faster development times and increased effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.

## Market Potential and Growth

Schrödinger has a high growth potential for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The medical research and clinical trials market in the US alone is valued at $47 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. Despite this vast market, Schrödinger's current annual billing is only $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>, indicating significant room for expansion. The company is currently growing at rates above 20% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Valuation and Long-Term Outlook

Despite its growth, Schrödinger's shares currently trade at a very demanding valuation, exceeding 40 times sales, and the company does not yet produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Bill Gates' investment in Schrödinger is seen as a very long-term play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. The belief is that if the company can capture just 10% of the enormous medical research and clinical trials market, its value could increase significantly from its current market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

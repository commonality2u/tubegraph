## Market Reaction Amid Economic Downturn
[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] and many other great investors have expressed surprise at the strong stock market rally, which saw a rise of over 40% in less than two months, even as the economy was experiencing one of its worst moments, with potential gross domestic product (GDP) falls of up to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This surprise also extended to the phenomenon of the stock market continuing to rise and approaching historical highs despite what is expected to be the worst economic contraction in 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

This indicates a restrained approach during volatile market conditions.

## Key Investment Philosophy
[[warren_buffetts_investment_tips | Warren Buffett's Investment Tips]] emphasize focusing on the current price of shares for making a smart purchase for the future, rather than attempting to guess short-term or medium-term market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This principle highlights a value-oriented, long-term perspective.

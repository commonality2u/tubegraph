Financial experts, including investor Bill Ackman, have provided insights into the potential behavior of the [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]] during U.S. election years, especially concerning interest rate decisions by the Federal Reserve (Fed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:07">[07:46:07]</a>.

## Federal Reserve's Independence

There has been public discussion about whether the Fed and other central banks might lower interest rates before the 2024 elections, which some perceive as a political move to favor the incumbent party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:58">[07:48:58]</a>. An early interest rate cut could stimulate the economy, increase housing values, and boost the [[stock_market_rally_amidst_economic_contraction | stock market]], potentially making voters happier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:54">[08:05:54]</a>.

However, Bill Ackman asserts that interest rates will decrease regardless of the elections, and "sooner than many people think" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This perspective suggests that current market fear, which prevents investment despite many "cheap companies," might be misplaced if people expect rate cuts only in late 2024 or 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:00">[08:31:00]</a>.

## Historical Performance

Historically, the [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]] has performed very well in election years over the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### Impact of Presidential Outcome

*   **New President Elected**: If a new president from a different party is elected, the average [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]] return typically aligns with the historical average of 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>. This holds true whether the new president is a Republican or a Democrat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.
*   **Incumbent President Re-elected**: If the current president is re-elected, the average return is "quite higher" than the historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a>.

Overall, the average return for the [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]] in election years is 11%, which is "quite higher" than the general historical average returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>.

### Political Influence

Politicians tend to influence the economy because they desire positive economic conditions and a strong [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]], along with a healthy real estate market, to garner votes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>. In the United States, the state of the economy is often a determining factor in voter polls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>. The speaker notes that despite political affiliations, the American economy's inherent solidity drives it forward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>.

The U.S. government, while theoretically independent of the Fed, tends to exert some pressure, which could further aid the economy during election years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="0:41:01">[01:41:01]</a>.

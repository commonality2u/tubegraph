The invasion of Ukraine has had serious consequences, with financial ramifications that could be potentially dangerous in the coming weeks or months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This situation impacts many companies, some of which have already announced they will stop operating in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. It's crucial to understand how these events affect corporate fundamentals and how investors can protect themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Economic Problems and Financial Contagion

One of the main economic problems in Russia is the emerging "corralito" phenomenon, where people cannot withdraw money from banks, leading to panic queues at institutions like Sberbank, one of Russia's largest banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. This situation could branch out into widespread financial contagion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Historically, the 2008 crisis saw Lehman Brothers, a smaller entity than the current Russian economy, infect the entire financial system, leading to a huge loss of trust and economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Similarly, Russia's 1998 bankruptcy caused significant stock market falls of 20-30% in some markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

European banks have significant exposure to Russia, with countries like France and Italy having levels of 25 billion [unknown currency] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. Banks like ING of Holland have seen sharp declines due to fear of contagion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Russia also faces bond payments by March 16th, and a failure to find available funds due to war spending and economic sanctions could lead to bankruptcy or default, turning its bonds into "junk bonds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation and Energy Prices

The current situation aggravates the existing [[us_and_global_inflation_trends | inflation]] problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. The price of oil has exceeded $110, further intensifying [[energy_crisis_and_its_effect_on_inflation | inflation]], especially in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. Natural gas prices are also at their highest levels, rebounding even as winter passes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. Germany, for example, relies on Russia for 50% of its gas and oil consumption and 35% of its coal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. The North Stream 2 oil and gas pipeline operator has already declared bankruptcy, adding difficulty to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

A Goldman Sachs analyst noted that historical events with spikes in energy prices and [[us_and_global_inflation_trends | inflation]] typically result in market falls of 15% to 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The invasion of Kuwait by Iraq, which removed 10% of global oil production (similar to Russia's share today), led to significant price increases, with oil rebounding 50% in 71 days during the Gulf War <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. If sanctions become permanent and oil remains high, the impact could be prolonged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.

## Central Bank Dilemma and Market Behavior

Central banks face a difficult dilemma: the economy is accelerating due to conflict, but there's high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] and very low [[role_of_interest_rates_and_inflation_in_investments | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. In Europe, raising [[role_of_interest_rates_and_inflation_in_investments | interest rates]] to control [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] would severely impact highly indebted citizens with mortgages, affecting consumption, company profits, and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The alternative is to let [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] run wild with low [[role_of_interest_rates_and_their_impact_on_markets | interest rates]], creating an environment of negative real returns that generates stock market bubbles as people borrow money at zero to buy appreciating assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

In the US, the situation is similar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. The Fed regrets not raising rates earlier and plans to proceed with caution due to the Ukraine conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. While the conflict is negative in the short term, central bank relaxation on [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] could cause large stock market bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. However, if [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] is attacked directly, the stock market will remain under pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>.

### Stagflation and Sectoral Impacts

The current environment could lead to "stagflation" â€“ a combination of no economic growth and [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>. In the 1973-74 period of stagflation, the stock market fell 40% as central banks raised [[role_of_interest_rates_and_their_impact_on_markets | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>. In such environments, energy stocks perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>, while other sectors like materials, consumer companies, and technology suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. Safe, stable consumption companies like Procter & Gamble and Unilever also experience difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in the Current Environment

To protect oneself in this environment, investing in safe investments, liquidity, and fixed income is generally advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. However, fixed income is likely to lose value if [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] continues unabated and central banks do not act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Energy and Renewable Energy

The energy sector has been the only winner in this crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. Warren Buffett has made a significant investment in Occidental Petroleum, an oil stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>, following his successful past investments in oil companies like PetroChina (2003-2004) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:45">[00:49:45]</a>.

Renewable energy companies are also gaining attention, as Europe considers transferring windfall profits from energy companies to consumers and encouraging renewable transition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>. Companies like Brooksfield Renewable Energy Partners operate globally, mainly in North America and Europe, focusing on hydroelectric, solar thermal, and wind energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>. They have long-term contracts, providing high income visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:37">[00:39:37]</a>. The global investment in renewable energy is expected to multiply tenfold in the next 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.

Oil and gas companies are currently earning significant profits. Many are using this money to reduce debt and buy back shares, rather than pumping more oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. Suncor Energy, a large Canadian company, has a low breakeven point (around $35 for Texas oil) and plans to reduce it further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>. Its current stock price is 30% lower than in 2018, despite oil prices being 30-40% higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:51">[00:42:51]</a>.

### Other Sectors

*   **Defense companies:** Companies like Martin benefit as countries like Germany double their defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>.
*   **Supermarkets/Food companies:** These are proving resilient. While they initially faced pressure from rising food prices, they are now raising prices and benefitting from consistent consumer demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:11">[01:20:11]</a>.
*   **Financials:** The financial sector has seen declines due to fears of financial contagion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>.
*   **Payment Processors:** Companies like Visa and Mastercard, despite suspending operations in Russia (less than 3% of sales), act as "toll booths" on [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]]. As prices rise, their percentage-based fees increase, expanding margins as their costs do not rise proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:32">[00:57:32]</a>.
*   **Technology and Growth Stocks:** These sectors have been negatively impacted by the current market conditions and [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | inflation]] concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:19">[00:17:19]</a>.

## Conclusion

The current geopolitical and economic climate presents significant challenges and opportunities in global financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Understanding the [[impact_on_global_financial_markets | impact of inflation and interest rates on the economy]] is crucial. While volatility leads to panic sales, these periods can also generate good returns for the future if investors act with caution and identify undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Recognizing emotional selling and adhering to a long-term investment vision are key to navigating these turbulent times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>.

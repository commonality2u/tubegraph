This article provides an [[analysis_of_specific_stocks_in_the_healthcare_and_technology_sectors | analysis of specific stocks in the healthcare and technology sectors]], with a focus on recent performance and broader market conditions, drawing insights from prominent investors like Stanley Druckenmiller and Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## General Market Sentiment and Tech Stocks

Stanley Druckenmiller, an investor with a strong track record of 30% annual returns, has stated that the stock market and economy are "approaching hell" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He warned at the beginning of 2022 that declines would start due to inflation, rising interest rates, and new variants of the virus (though the third risk seems less likely) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>. Druckenmiller believes there is a bubble across all assets globally, including cryptos, wine, art, luxury cars, real estate, stocks, and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>. Unlike the 1990s tech bubble, which was focused, many assets now trade above historical averages, limiting "refuge" options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

The current environment has seen high speculation in scarce luxury goods like sneakers, watches, and limited-edition cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. The danger lies in interest rates potentially remaining low, which fuels speculative environments, as a zero cost of money encourages investment in long-term assets expected to generate future profits, leading to a bubble in high-growth stocks with no immediate earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. The Federal Reserve is in a complex situation: raising rates could cause a recession and deeper market falls, while not raising them fast enough could lead to a bigger bubble due to negative real rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>.

Bubbles in the stock market are characterized by:
*   Complexity of products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>
*   High levels of fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:08:00">[15:08:00]</a>
*   Use of debt to invest in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:11:00">[15:11:00]</a>
*   Extremely high profit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:16:00">[15:16:00]</a>

Many growth stocks, especially those trading at high price-to-sales ratios (e.g., 30-50 times sales), were considered dangerous a year ago due to their lack of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>. This has led to significant valuation compression:
*   **FIFA ISSSA:** Compressed from 64 times to 13 times sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>.
*   **Palantir** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>
*   **Roque:** Dropped 50% due to slightly lower growth expectations, indicating extreme overvaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>.
*   **Beyond Meat, Robinhood, Carvana:** Experienced gigantic valuation compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:40:00">[16:40:00]</a>.

A problem for tech companies is the impact of falling stock prices on employee compensation, particularly stock options, which reduce employee earnings and may lead to new share issuance, diluting shareholder value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:03:00">[17:03:00]</a>.

Druckenmiller protects his portfolio not by shorting stocks (which can be dangerous in bear market rallies) but by selling or reducing equity positions and moving to the bond market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:44:00">[18:44:00]</a>. However, this year, both stocks and bonds have fallen, offering no refuge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>.

### Druckenmiller's Portfolio Adjustments

Druckenmiller has adjusted his portfolio to protect against inflation and current market conditions:
*   Increased positions in companies like **Procter & Gamble (P&G)** (14% of portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:28:00">[20:28:00]</a>.
*   Holds **Microsoft** and **Google** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:33:00">[20:33:00]</a>.
*   Holds **Palo Alto Networks**, a cybersecurity company that has performed relatively well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:38:00">[20:38:00]</a>.
*   Lowered stocks in **Carvana** despite increasing positions, highlighting its 50% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:47:00">[20:47:00]</a>.
*   Incorporated new positions in companies like **Chevron** and **T-Mobile**, which are resistant and predictable sectors, or raw materials to hedge against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="39:33:00">[39:33:00]</a>.

He maintains a balance, not going all-in on raw materials, as a recession could cause demand and prices for those to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:41:00">[40:41:00]</a>. Businesses like Microsoft, which are less dependent on supply/demand and more on essential macroeconomic elements, can maintain pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:06:00">[41:06:00]</a>.

## Recent Tech Company Performance

### Amazon

Amazon's recent results were considered challenging, with its stock dropping around 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>.
*   **North America Segment:** Sales increased slightly (64-69 million), but the segment shifted from making money to losing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:28:00">[43:28:00]</a>.
*   **International Segment:** Sales decreased, while costs increased, also resulting in losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:38:00">[43:38:00]</a>.
*   **Amazon Web Services (AWS):** The "jewel in the crown," it continued to grow at expected rates with improved margins, generating virtually all current profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:53:00">[43:53:00]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flow:** Deteriorated significantly, turning negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>.
*   **Share Dilution:** Unlike other large tech companies like Facebook and Google that buy back shares, Amazon has been diluting them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:53:00">[44:53:00]</a>.
*   **Future Expectations:** Low growth forecast (3-7%) for the next quarter, with profits expected to be minimal or even a loss, compared to $7 billion in profits the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:15:00">[45:15:00]</a>.

Amazon plans to optimize existing logistics centers rather than expanding with new ones, focusing on what they already have <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:10:00">[44:10:00]</a>. Prospects for recovery may improve in Q3 or Q4 when comparable bases from the previous year (when everyone was confined and buying online) are easier to beat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:43:00">[45:43:00]</a>.

### Google

Google, part of the True Value funds, has corrected from nearly $3,000 to below $2,200 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:21:00">[46:21:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth:** Grew 26%, which is impressive given the difficult comparable base from the previous year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:45:00">[46:45:00]</a>.
*   **Profitability:** Maintained profit margin. Earnings per share (EPS) did not grow due to exceptional profits from investments in bonds or other companies in the previous year. Adjusting for this, true EPS growth would be strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:05:00">[48:05:00]</a>.
*   **Business Lines:**
    *   **YouTube:** Only grew 14% as people are no longer confined and watching less YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:25:00">[49:25:00]</a>.
    *   **Google Cloud:** Performing well and scaling, expected to generate significant profits in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:48:00">[49:48:00]</a>.
*   **Cash Flow & Share Buybacks:** Generating substantial cash flow (almost $20 billion) and reduced capital expenditures. The company bought back almost $12 billion in shares during the quarter, benefiting earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:07:00">[51:07:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Trading at a historical low valuation range, currently at around 18-19 times earnings (excluding cash), compared to an average of 26 times earnings over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:08:00">[52:08:00]</a>. It is expected to continue growing revenue at 20-25% annually and accelerate due to new business lines like Google Cloud and YouTube's monetization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:01:00">[53:01:00]</a>.

### Microsoft

Microsoft's results were strong and aligned with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:40:00">[53:40:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Growth:** Grew 18% (21% adjusted for currency), impressive for a mature company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:51:00">[53:51:00]</a>.
*   **Profit Growth:** Profits grew 23% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:06:00">[54:06:00]</a>.
*   **Business Lines:**
    *   **Productivity and Business Processes (Office 365, Windows, LinkedIn):** Sales grew 19%, but profits grew 23% due to expanding margins, likely from price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:27:00">[54:27:00]</a>. Microsoft recently announced price increases for Office licenses, which customers generally accept due to its strong market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:40:00">[55:40:00]</a>.
    *   **Cloud (Azure):** Sales grew 29%, and profits grew 33%, indicating expanding profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:31:00">[56:31:00]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Microsoft is not significantly affected by interest rate increases, armed conflicts, or inflation due to its robust business model and pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:49:00">[56:49:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Trading at 28 times earnings, similar to non-growing companies like Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:02:00">[57:02:00]</a>. Its average price in recent years has been 26 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:26:00">[57:26:00]</a>. The company is expected to grow earnings per share by 15-20% annually, driven by price increases, volume growth, and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="57:44:00">[57:44:00]</a>.

### Facebook (Meta Platforms)

Facebook's stock fell alongside other tech companies following Netflix's deflation, as it unleashed a "tsunami of fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:04">[01:00:04]</a>.
*   **Results:** Earnings were largely in line with expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:22">[01:00:22]</a>.
*   **Metaverse Investments:** The company announced a de-escalation of metaverse investments, which was positively received by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.
*   **Future Growth:** Expected to grow less in Q2 due to difficult comparable bases from the previous year, but should return to historical average growth in Q3 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:55">[01:00:55]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Trading at around 15-16 times earnings (excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:11">[01:01:11]</a>.

### PayPal

PayPal's Q1 results (excluding eBay) showed 19% currency-adjusted growth, which was considered reasonable and aligned with market expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:04">[01:02:04]</a>.
*   **Stock Reaction:** Initially positive, but then deflated as the broader market fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:25">[01:02:25]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Net of cash, it trades at around 19-21 times forward earnings, which is below its historical average valuation of 33-40 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:34">[01:02:34]</a>.
*   **Growth Outlook:** Expected to grow at an annual rate of 12-15% over the next 6-8 years, leveraging its dominant market position in online payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>.
*   **Earnings Guidance:** Lowered slightly, reflecting what is happening to many large tech companies post-COVID growth acceleration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

### Salesforce

Salesforce has experienced significant stock declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:23">[01:04:23]</a>.

### Other Tech-Related Companies

*   **Molex:** A top holding in the new True Value Company fund, it manufactures electrical components for automobiles. It's a high-growth stock that has fallen significantly, trading at around 11 times earnings, well below the UK market average of 15 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>. Its current management has increased profit from 7 million to 55 million, representing a 24% compound annual growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:22">[01:07:22]</a>. Tesla is one of its main clients, and its segment related to electric cars is growing at 100% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:49">[01:07:49]</a>. It has low debt and is aligned with shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:38">[01:08:38]</a>.
*   **Zalando:** An online fashion retailer in Europe, it has suffered from high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:25">[01:27:25]</a>. Deceleration of growth is expected this year (13%), but it is a viable business that produces an interesting EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:06">[01:28:06]</a>. It's expected to generate profits of almost two euros per share, trading at 20 times future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:19">[01:28:19]</a>. It has started share buybacks and is reducing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:14">[01:29:14]</a>. The company projects 20 billion in billing by 2025, representing an 18% compound growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>.
*   **Alibaba:** Recovered recently after China's regime met with tech companies, reassuring them about new regulations and penalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:41">[02:06:41]</a>. Licensing for new video games has also been re-authorized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. Warren Buffett also mentioned investing in China because he found more value there than in American stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:44">[02:07:44]</a>.

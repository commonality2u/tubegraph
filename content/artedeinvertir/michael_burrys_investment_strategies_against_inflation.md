[[Michael Burrys investment strategy and theories | Michael Burry]], a well-known investor, has recently structured his portfolio to benefit from and hedge against high inflation, drawing parallels to historical economic periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. His approach combines traditional value investing with significant macroeconomic bets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Burry is notable for "putting his money on the table" with his predictions, having successfully foreseen the dot-com bubble and the 2007-2008 housing crisis, profiting significantly from both <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. He has structured his portfolio to benefit from rising asset prices and from those that are expected to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Current Market Outlook and Inflation Predictions
Burry has warned of a "bubble" in many assets and anticipates a period of high inflation in the coming months or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. This inflation, which recently shot up to 4.2% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>, is something not experienced since 2005-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He believes this will significantly impact various asset classes, benefiting some while harming others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Key Investments Against Inflation
Burry's strategy against inflation primarily involves bets against bonds, as rising interest rates typically cause bond prices to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

### TLT Put Options
A significant portion of his portfolio, roughly 40% or $500 million, is placed in a "massive bet" on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. This includes buying put options on TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Mechanism**: Put options allow for significant gains if the underlying asset's price drops, with the risk limited to the premium paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This creates an asymmetrical investment where one can "lose a little, but if things go well, win a lot" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Longer-duration bonds like those in TLT are highly sensitive to interest rate changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:10">[00:19:10]</a>. A 1% rise in interest rates can cause a 20-year bond ETF to drop by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Scale**: While the nominal figure reported is $170 million, the actual premium paid for these options might be much lower, for instance, $4 million, allowing him to control a large number of shares with limited upfront cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:43]</a>. He is willing to renew these options if they expire without profit, accepting small losses in pursuit of a large potential gain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:23:45]</a>.

### TBT Inverse ETF
Burry has also invested in TBT, an inverse ETF on bonds, which goes up when bonds go down and is leveraged two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. He has further leveraged this by using options on TBT, creating "leverage on leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **Risk**: This is considered a "negative carry trade," meaning it costs money to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:19]</a> and is generally not a long-term holding due to derivative costs and potential for significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:27:08]</a>.

### Economic Analogy: Weimar Republic
Burry draws a stark analogy between current global money printing and the Weimar Republic (Germany in the 1920s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:08]</a>.
*   **Similarities**: He notes similarities in widespread money printing (quantitative easing since 2010) and a rising stock market with small investors piling in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">[00:15:34]</a>.
*   **Key Difference**: Unlike previous quantitative easing, Burry believes money is now reaching the real economy through stimulus checks and government spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:33]</a>. This, combined with supply chain issues and rising raw material costs (steel, copper, aluminum, wood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:17:05]</a>, is leading to higher consumer prices and wages, ultimately forcing central banks to raise interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Consequences**: In such a scenario, bonds become worthless, and people's deposits lose value, as happened in 1923-1924 Weimar hyperinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:49]</a>. Assets that tend to hold up better are shares in real estate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy during inflation | Warren Buffett]]'s Similar Observation**: [[Warren Buffetts investment advice for inflation | Warren Buffett]] also warned about rising costs in manufacturing and construction, noting that Berkshire Hathaway's companies are forced to raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:27">[00:18:43]</a>.

## Other Significant Bets
While his inflation bets are prominent, Burry also holds other positions that reflect his market view:
*   **Bearish on Tesla**: He holds a massive bearish position on Tesla, estimated at $500 million, believing its valuation is not justified by its automotive or software development prospects, anticipating competition from other manufacturers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:26">[00:27:30]</a>. He uses put options for this bet, similar to his inflation strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:32:12]</a>.
*   **Bullish on Google and Facebook**: Surprisingly, he has made "massive" bullish bets on Facebook and Google shares, using call options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:45]</a>. He views these as high-quality businesses with strong operating leverage, increasing sales and profits while keeping costs stable, leading to disproportionate profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:18]</a>. These companies are seen as less vulnerable to inflation and are trading at reasonable multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:57">[00:36:04]</a>.
*   **Bearish on Growth Stocks**: He also has a bearish investment on the Russell index of growth companies, targeting those that typically do not generate profits and are popular among the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:42]</a>.

## General Investment Principles
Burry's investment philosophy emphasizes understanding macroeconomics and finding "asymmetrical" investments where potential losses are limited, but potential gains are significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:39]</a>. He urges investors to be cautious in the current environment, especially with highly speculative assets like "meme stocks," certain cloud software companies, and cryptocurrencies, which he views as exhibiting "bubble behaviors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:46:46]</a>. He advises against being "tourists of the stock market" and stresses making informed decisions based on thorough analysis, avoiding companies with excessive debt or overvalued projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:54">[00:43:32]</a>.

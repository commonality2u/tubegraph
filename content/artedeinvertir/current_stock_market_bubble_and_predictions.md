Vicens Hong, one of Wall Street's most respected investors, with average annual returns exceeding 15%, rose to prominence for accurately predicting and profiting from the fall of Lehman Brothers, which led to a major financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Hong has now shared his specific predictions regarding the end of the [[indicators_of_economic_bubbles | current stock market bubble]] and how he plans to profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Vicens Hong: Background and Investment Philosophy

Vicens Hong has accumulated a personal wealth exceeding $1 billion, investing both his own capital and that of his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. He started from scratch in 1996, founding his first investment fund, Greenlight, at 28 years old with a modest capital of $800,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This fund grew from managing $1 million to over $12 billion due to successful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Hong is also an expert poker player, having participated in the World Series of Poker multiple times, finishing 28th out of over 10,000 participants in 2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He donated his $650,000 prize from this tournament to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Alzheimer's research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Hong operates as a "long-short investor," meaning he invests for the long term in undervalued stocks with strong prospects while simultaneously investing against, or shorting, stocks he believes are overvalued or have poor future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This [[financial_market_analysis_and_predictions | strategy]] is designed to produce satisfactory results in any market environment, as bearish investments can support the portfolio during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Notable Past Successes

Hong's track record includes significant successes:
*   **Lehman Brothers**: In April 2008, five months before its bankruptcy in September 2008, Hong publicly warned that Lehman Brothers was manipulating its accounts and posed a huge risk to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. His fund positioned itself to profit from the stock's fall, yielding high returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   **Allied Capital Fraud**: He also made significant profits by uncovering the fraud case involving Allied Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Wirecard**: More recently, he alerted investors about the Wirecard case, a German technology company that lost over 95% of its stock market value due to a fraud scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

Hong is known as a conservative investor, which helped him navigate previous [[analysis_of_stock_market_bubbles_and_high_valuations | bubbles]] in 2000 and 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Prediction of the Stock Market Bubble's End

In a recent letter to investors, Hong stated:
> "We are in the middle of a huge technological bubble. Our working hypothesis tells us that September 2nd, 2020, marked the market ceiling and that the bubble has already begun to deflate. Investor sentiment is changing from greed to complacency. We have adjusted our portfolio according to this hypothesis, adding short positions in many low-quality stocks that are trading at very high valuations." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>

It is highly unusual for Hong to give such a precise date for a market cycle change, and he has never been this specific in his 25 years of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>. The NASDAQ index, which Hong considers overvalued, indeed reached highs of 12,500 on September 2nd, 2020, and has not touched that level since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

### Symptoms of the Current Bubble

Hong identifies several [[current economic risks for the stock market | symptoms]] indicating a large technological bubble:

*   **High Number of IPOs**: Historically correlated with market cycle changes, there is currently high investor appetite for new technology companies, with many IPOs seeing revaluations over 200% on their first day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   **Companies Without Profits**: An impressive 80% of listed companies are currently not making profits, surpassing the record set during the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>.
*   **High Degree of Speculation**: Hong cites the example of Hertz, the car rental company that went bankrupt. Despite its bankruptcy, speculative fever drove its shares from $1 to $5, even higher than its price before the bankruptcy announcement ($3) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. The American regulator (SEC) had to intervene to prevent the company from selling worthless shares to eager investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. After Hertz announced bankruptcy, the number of investors holding its shares tripled from 40,000 to over 140,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Share Splits Driving Performance**: Popular shares, such as Tesla and Apple, have seen significant revaluations (over 50% for Tesla, over 30% for Apple) immediately after announcing stock splits, even though splits are neutral events that do not add company value in a rational market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

## Bearish Bets: Stocks Vicens Hong is Investing Against

Vicens Hong has focused some of his bearish bets on popular, high-valuation stocks.

### Amazon (AMZN)

While acknowledging Amazon as a great company, Hong believes its [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | current valuation]] is excessive due to its recent rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Amazon's sales grew 37%, and its operating cash flow grew more than 56%, indicating strong operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Valuation Metric**: For technology companies, the "EV/EBITDA" ratio is preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Amazon's historical average EV/EBITDA over the last five years is around 26 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
*   **Future Earnings**: Amazon's estimated EBITDA is over $54 billion in 2020, projected to grow to over $100 billion in the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. Valuing this at its historical average would yield a price of $5,200, which is higher than its current $3,200 but lower than the $1,700 price when previously analyzed a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA)

Hong has invested against Tesla to profit from a potential stock market drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. He has publicly accused Tesla of manipulating its accounts to artificially inflate profits and playing with investor expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>. He cited Elon Musk's involvement in "alarming manipulation scandals" and criticized the SEC's insignificant fine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Hong claims Tesla is artificially increasing income through "sales of cars that do not exist" and using future tax credits to boost current reported profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Tesla is projected to have $3 in earnings per share by 2021, but its current trading price gives it a valuation of over 140 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Investing in such highly valued companies requires a very deep understanding of the company's ability to drastically increase future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

## Optimistic Investments: Stocks Vicens Hong is Buying

Despite his bearish [[predictions on stock market risks for 2024 | predictions]] for the overall market, Hong has made specific investments where he sees future growth.

### VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX)

Hong invested over $67 million in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX) in the last quarter, aiming to benefit from a potential rise in gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. He explained his reasoning in a letter to investors:
> "The only thing that the Democratic and Republican parties have in common is their fondness for printing money. More than 3.3 trillion dollars printed this year alone, which represents 22 percent of all dollars in circulation in 2019. As expected, gold is doing well. Those investors who had criticized gold for decades are now buying." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>

Hong believes the behavior of gold is directly linked to the printing of money by central banks, as this ultimately leads to inflation, which is positive for gold's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. The GDX ETF appreciated over 50% in the last 12 months due to global money printing to combat the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

### Green Brick Partners (GRBK)

Hong has invested an impressive 31% of his portfolio, over $280 million, in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), controlling 48% of its circulating shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **Business**: Green Brick Partners builds residential homes in the fast-growing Atlanta and Texas regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   **Market Conditions**: The current low interest rates set by central banks are fueling significant growth in the construction sector, and Green Brick is well-capitalized to capture this growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   **Demand Shift**: Demand for housing outside urban centers is dramatically increasing, which is Green Brick's market niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **Financial Performance**: The company's profit before taxes increased over 100% compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Green Brick has tripled its profits over the last four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantages**: Compared to competitors, Green Brick shows the greatest growth, highest profit margins, and least debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Analysts estimate the company could earn $3 in earnings per share in the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Historically, homebuilders have traded at a P/E ratio of 12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Multiplying $3 by 12 yields a future valuation of $36, representing a very interesting potential gain compared to its current trading price of $21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This potential realization is likely the main reason for Hong's significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_market_insights_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]] has recently invested an impressive sum of $7 billion in a new sector and a specific stock, which he initially sought to keep secret from the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This information has now been made public by law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. This significant purchase highlights [[warren_buffetts_investment_advice | Warren Buffett's Investment Tips]] that one of the world's best investors is willing to buy large sums of money even when a stock is at an all-time high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Focus on the Insurance Sector

The insurance sector is one of the most profitable areas for [[warren_buffetts_market_insights_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]] throughout his history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Since 1988, a dollar invested in [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_and_insights | Warren Buffett's]] company, Berkshire Hathaway, has multiplied by over 100 times, significantly outperforming the S&P 500, which multiplied by 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

Berkshire Hathaway can be considered the largest insurance company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A significant portion of [[warren_buffetts_recent_stock_acquisitions | Warren Buffett's]] fortune is attributed to his insurance investments, with Geico being a prime example of a low-cost auto insurance company that has provided high returns since 1998 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. The insurance sector, including private companies accumulated over the years, forms a large part of Berkshire Hathaway's holding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### The "Float" Concept

The key to profitability in the insurance sector, as explained by [[warren_buffetts_market_insights_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]], is "the float" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

> [!quote] Warren Buffett on Float
> "It is that money that we have but that does not belong to us, we can invest it for our own benefit before being paid in the form of insurance compensation." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>

Insurance companies receive premiums upfront (e.g., $1,000 for a policy) but only pay out a portion of that amount in claims (e.g., $900) after a certain period, which can be 6, 12, or 24 months, or even longer for multi-year policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>. This interim period allows insurers to invest the "float" for their own benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Unlike banks that must pay interest on deposits, insurers generate profit from selling policies and then invest the float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

While regulations restrict the risk level of these investments (e.g., primarily in treasury bills, fixed income, short-term bonds, and a small part in the stock market), [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] recognized his ability to invest more aggressively in stocks with this float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Studies suggest that 40-50% of Berkshire Hathaway's performance comes from the intelligent use of this float and [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett's]] investment capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

As of March 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's float from its insurance businesses amounts to $168 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Even with an average annual return of 5-7% on this float, it generates over $20 billion in pre-tax profits, contributing significantly to Berkshire Hathaway's value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This float has consistently grown over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>.

## The Secret Stock Revealed: Chap (CB)

The company [[warren_buffetts_latest_investment_moves | Warren Buffett]] is aggressively investing in is **Chubb (CB)**, an insurance company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:30">[00:24:30]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_latest_investment_moves | Warren Buffett]] asked the SEC to keep these purchases secret <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. He invested nearly $7 billion into this stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. It is notable because it is a publicly listed company, unlike many of Berkshire Hathaway's other private insurance holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

Chubb focuses on property insurance, including home, car, health, accident, and even agricultural insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. They primarily sell to corporations rather than individuals, handling larger policies like insuring office buildings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

### Chubb's Competitive Advantages:
*   **Big Data:** Extensive data on risks allows for accurate pricing and profit generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. This creates a "moat" that protects it from competitors who might incur losses by underpricing risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.
*   **Profitability (Combined Ratio):** Chubb consistently maintains a higher profit margin compared to its rivals, indicated by its low combined ratio (e.g., 86% last year, meaning a 14% profit margin from insurance sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:01">[00:29:01]</a>.
*   **Conservative Management:** Chubb manages its investments prudently, with a book value of $60 billion and only $15 billion in debt (a low debt-to-book value ratio of ~0.25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. It holds a very high credit quality rating of "double A" from Standard & Poor's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.
*   **Investment Philosophy:** 84% of Chubb's investment portfolio (totaling $120 billion in investments, derived from its float) is in short-term debt (maximum 5 years duration) or bonds with high credit ratings (Triple A, Double A, Triple B), indicating a very conservative approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>.

> [!info] Chubb's Float
> Chubb's float is approximately $120 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:22">[00:33:22]</a>. It invoices around $50 billion annually, meaning its float covers roughly two to three full years of insurance sales, often due to multi-year policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:20">[00:33:20]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_current_investment_moves | Warren Buffett]] could potentially achieve higher returns on Chubb's float (currently yielding 3-4%) if he had full control, possibly hinting at a future full acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:03">[00:33:03]</a>.

### Valuation and Performance
Chubb is trading at approximately 12 times earnings, which is the average for the insurance sector but well below the S&P 500 average of 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. The company's earnings per share have grown significantly, from $3 in 2005 to $24 currently, representing a roughly 12-13% annual return plus dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. Profitability has improved since interest rates rose in 2022-2023, as insurers can invest their float in higher-yielding treasury bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:58">[00:34:58]</a>.

## Market Outlook and [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_for_small_capital | Warren Buffett's Perspective]]

Despite fears of a potential recession indicated by the inverted yield curve and declining manufacturing indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>, [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] continues investment activity if attractive opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>. He believes that the market is currently bifurcated, with large tech companies being highly valued (almost 30 times earnings for the S&P 500's largest tech firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>, and 38 times on average for the "Magnificent Seven") while other sectors, like insurance, are trading at much lower valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:10">[00:20:10]</a>.

> [!info] Market Bifurcation
> The market is showing a "bifurcation" where a segment is highly valued (mega-tech companies) and another part is quite cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. European stocks trade at 13 times earnings, and S&P Small Caps are at 14 times earnings, both below historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_market_insights_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]] and other investors like Bill Ackman are looking beyond the "Magnificent Seven" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Future growth is expected to decelerate for these large tech companies while accelerating for the rest of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:50">[00:19:50]</a>. This points to potentially lower returns for highly valued stocks and better opportunities in undervalued segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

## Other Notable Insurance Companies

### Kinsale Capital Group (KNSL)
Kinsale Capital Group specializes in "excess and surplus lines," insuring high-risk activities with specific needs, such as construction, commercial transportation (airlines, ships), and electricians, where traditional insurers might lack data or interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

Kinsale has delivered exceptional returns, multiplying by 20 times on the stock market in the last 5-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. It exhibits:
*   **High Growth:** One of the few listed insurance companies with high growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantages:** A large database of risks and a "contrarian underwriting" approach, where they issue policies more aggressively when others pull back after major events like hurricanes, allowing them to charge higher prices due to less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:30">[00:40:30]</a>.
*   **Low Cost Model:** A focus on low operating costs and maintaining direct control over policy issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:49">[00:42:49]</a>.
*   **Market Share:** Despite its growth, Kinsale holds only a 1.1% market share in its niche, suggesting significant room for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:10">[00:43:10]</a>.

Kinsale's combined ratio is notably better than comparable companies, indicating strong discipline in issuing insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:36">[00:44:36]</a>. While its stock recently dropped due to a perceived slowdown in growth (from 30-50% to 25%), it remains a very high growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:46:57]</a>.

### Markel (MKL)
Markel is considered a smaller alternative to Berkshire Hathaway, following a similar business model of owning insurance businesses and investing their float in bonds, stocks, or acquiring entire companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Markel's stock has performed exceptionally well, growing from $8 to $1,600 per share since its listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.

*   **Book Value Growth:** The evolution of its book value is indicative of a well-managed, stable, and predictable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>.
*   **Non-Cyclical Sector:** Insurance is generally non-cyclical because it's often legally required (car insurance) or deemed essential (home, life insurance), providing stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy:** Markel has a float of $26 trillion and aggressively invests about 35% of its portfolio in equity securities (stocks), similar to [[warren_buffetts_investment_advice | Warren Buffett's Investment Tips]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Its investment director, Tomás Giner, follows a prudent, long-term philosophy aligned with shareholder interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:43">[00:54:43]</a>. Markel's stock portfolio includes high-quality companies like Disney, Watsco, Microsoft, Apple, Meta, Amazon, Google, and Brookfield, with its main position in Berkshire Hathaway itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Markel's price-to-book value is 1.4, aligning with its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

## Other Companies and Market Insights

*   **John Deere:** A cyclical growth business in the agriculture and construction sectors, currently in a slowdown phase due to rising interest rates and falling commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:57">[01:24:57]</a>. Its valuation is currently at its historical average, not indicating a bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:20">[01:27:20]</a>.
*   **FICO:** A credit rating company (Fair Isaac Corporation) that, despite being a very strong business, is trading at historically high valuations that have expanded rather than compressed in a high-interest-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:04">[01:28:04]</a>.
*   **SD Group:** A small-cap position that has seen new management and signs of animation, with past buybacks and recent additions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:33">[01:30:33]</a>.

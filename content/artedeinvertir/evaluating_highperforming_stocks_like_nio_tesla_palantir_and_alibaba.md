The "Art of Investing" addresses the current economic crisis and investor concerns about a potential new crisis in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Following a difficult year, prominent investors like Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Michael Burry have issued messages of caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article explores new risks to the economy and stock market, strategies for protection, and provides [[examples_of_highquality_companies_as_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]] in high-growth stocks such as NIO, [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]], Palantir, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Current Market Risks and Investor Concerns

Recent news of a mutated current problem that could transmit faster has caused panic among investors, raising fears of a new crisis in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This has led to immediate reactions, including flight cancellations, border closures, and new containment measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Stocks most affected are those related to the crisis, such as airlines, hotels, and catering companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. The effectiveness of current remedies against this new variant remains uncertain, contributing to market instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

Adding to the situation, new U.S. economic stimulus measures were approved at around $900 billion, significantly lower than the market's expectation of double that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The Federal Reserve and these stimulus measures were crucial for the 2020 recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Warnings from Renowned Investors

*   **Warren Buffett:** He recently urged the American government to increase stimulus measures to avoid an economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In an interview with CNBC, Buffett stated:
    > Congress is in the process of ruining the dreams of thousands of people. Congress needs to act now. We need another injection of money to complete the job. Congress is currently debating and I hope they extend the PPP program on a large scale to allow people to see the light at the end of the tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.
    Buffett emphasizes the importance of providing liquidity to families and corporations during times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

*   **Stanley Druckenmiller:** Known for one of the best investment track records, he expressed concern about current market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He noted:
    > Right now we are facing absolute euphoria. Everyone likes a party but after the party comes the hangover. I have no idea what the stock market is going to do in the short term. I don't know if it will go up 10% or down 10% but I would say that the next 3 or 5 years are going to be very very complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    Druckenmiller is aware that bull markets often conclude when euphoria becomes prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

*   **Joel Greenblatt:** This Wall Street legend, who has generated over 30% annual returns for more than 30 years and successfully navigated financial crises, warns of significant market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Greenblatt highlighted a "chilling fact":
    > If in 2020 you had bought every company that lost money in 2019 and that has a stock market capitalization greater than a billion dollars you would be earning an impressive 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
    He notes that in euphoric times, basic investment principles are forgotten, leading to the anomaly where companies losing money perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Historically, investing consistently in unprofitable companies leads to negative or significantly lower returns than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, some companies like Amazon or Netflix initially produced losses for years before generating significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

## Evaluating High-Growth Stocks with Current Losses

A three-step method can be applied to value high-growth companies that are currently operating at a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>:

1.  **Estimate Future Sales:** Project the company's sales in three to five years, assuming a growth rate lower than its current rate, as growth typically slows with scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. For example, if a company is growing at 40%, estimate 30% for future years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
2.  **Determine Future Profit Margins:** Assess potential profit margins once the company reaches maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This can be done by looking at mature companies in the same sector. For the automotive sector, look at Toyota or Volkswagen (around 6-7% profit margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. For technology/software, consider Microsoft or Google (around 20-25% profit margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This step helps derive future profit and then earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier:** Apply an appropriate earnings multiple based on the industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. A good industry with high growth potential, like technology, might warrant 30-40 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. A more cyclical industry, like automotive, might be 15-20 times earnings, even with some growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.

## [[Analyzing Stock Opportunities | Analysis of Specific High-Performing Stocks]]

### NIO (NIV)

NIO, the Chinese equivalent of [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]], trades at $48 per share and has multiplied by over 12 times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. It falls into the category of companies with losses in the last 12 months but exceptional stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

Using the three-step method:
1.  **Future Sales:** Analysts estimate NIO's sales at $47 billion for the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
2.  **Profit Margins:** Using mature automakers like Volkswagen or Toyota, a net profit margin of around 6% can be assumed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This yields a potential net profit of $3 billion for NIO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Dividing by total shares, this is about $2 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
3.  **Valuation Multiple:** The automotive sector typically trades at 10-15 times profits, but with higher growth, it could reach 15-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Multiplying $2 per share by 15 times yields an intrinsic valuation of around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

This suggests NIO is currently trading above its fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, if an investor has strong conviction and believes NIO could reach $100 billion in sales, profits could be $4 per share, potentially leading to a value of up to $80 per share at 15-20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]] (TSLA)

[[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]] trades at $680 per share and has multiplied by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. It began to generate profits in 2020 after losses in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 index has propelled its shares to new all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

Noted investor [[analysis_of_bearish_investments_in_tesla | Michael Burry]] (characterized in "The Big Short") has opened a bearish position on [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]] due to its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. Burry notes [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]]'s market capitalization exceeds $600 billion, which is higher than the rest of the traditional automobile manufacturers combined, despite [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]] generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Bloomberg's comparison of electric vehicle companies' value per vehicle produced vs. traditional manufacturers highlights this disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>:
*   Electric vehicle companies like NIO or [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]] are valued at over $1 million per vehicle produced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
*   Traditional manufacturers like Volkswagen, Toyota, or BMW are valued much lower, e.g., $10,000 for Volkswagen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
While [[investment_opportunities_and_analysis_of_tesla_uber_and_astrazeneca | Tesla]] currently generates low profits, it has the capacity for drastic future increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Investors should conduct detailed studies rather than investing solely based on rising stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Palantir Technologies (PLTR)

Palantir Technologies trades at $30 per share and has more than tripled since its listing three months ago at $10 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. It is a high-growth technology company specializing in analyzing large amounts of data to anticipate threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Palantir is also in a phase of producing losses, making it suitable for the three-step valuation method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

Using the three-step method:
1.  **Future Sales:** Expected to invoice around $1.4 billion in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Assuming a conservative 40% annual growth (less than its current 50%), it could reach $7.5 billion in sales in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
2.  **Profit Margins:** Mature technology companies like Microsoft, Oracle, or Google generate 20-25% profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Applying this to Palantir's future sales, it could have potential profits of $1.8 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. With 1.75 billion shares, this implies an earnings per share of $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
3.  **Valuation Multiple:** For a less cyclical, high-quality technology sector company, a 30 times earnings multiple could be applied, reflecting multiples of high-quality companies like Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.

This results in a fair value for Palantir of approximately $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. The current stock market price largely incorporates future benefit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Alibaba (BABA)

Alibaba is listed in the U.S. under the ticker BABA at $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. The company is currently under investigation by the Chinese government for alleged monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>, with some media suggesting it's a message to founder Jack Ma for being critical of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. In jurisdictions with fewer investor rights, such actions can lead to stock market losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:04">[00:17:04]</a>.

From a financial perspective, Alibaba's current valuation is attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings, with its intrinsic value potentially double the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Significant future growth is also expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. However, the financial factor is less relevant in the short to medium term compared to monitoring the political situation and the company's cooperation with government guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Protecting Your Investments in 2021

In volatile market situations, investing with common sense is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Key advice for 2021 includes:

*   **Maintain Liquidity:** Keep 10-30% liquidity in your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Statistically, the market corrects at least 10% annually, providing opportunities to deploy this capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>.
*   **Invest with Conviction:** Only invest in companies where you have strong conviction and have conducted an in-depth [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_banks_and_tech_companies | analysis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Even in euphoric or expensive markets, good [[examples_of_highquality_companies_as_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]] can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Observe Major Investors:** Pay attention to how major investors are positioning their portfolios against new risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. For example, Stanley Druckenmiller's main [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_banks_and_tech_companies | investments]] include Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft, characterized by high growth and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Michael Burry's main [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_banks_and_tech_companies | investments]] are focused on Google, Pfizer, and the pharmaceutical company ACWT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

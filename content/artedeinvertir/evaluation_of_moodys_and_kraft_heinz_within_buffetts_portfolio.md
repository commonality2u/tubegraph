[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]], widely regarded as the greatest investor of all time, manages a portfolio of listed shares valued at over $240 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. After a period of caution and selling due to a crisis, he has recently regained confidence, making significant purchases, including one exceeding $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Stock market transparency rules mandate that [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] periodically declares his stock acquisitions, sales, and main investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This article focuses on two specific holdings within his [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy | portfolio]]: Kraft Heinz and Moody's, providing an [[analysis_of_current_portfolio_adjustments_by_famous_investors | analysis of current portfolio adjustments by famous investors]]' insights.

## Kraft Heinz (KHC)

Kraft Heinz is a world-renowned company known for its sauces and food products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] has invested over $9 billion in Kraft Heinz shares, representing more than 4% of his [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy | portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. The stock is listed in the US under the ticker KHC and is priced at $32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.

### Challenges and Buffett's Mistake

Kraft Heinz stands as one of the few investments in [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] where he has incurred losses, having invested over five years ago at $80 per share, leading to a drop of more than 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] has publicly stated that his primary error was paying an excessively high price based on the company's profit-generating capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>.

> [00:18:27] From here you can also make an important choice for your own investments, which is that no matter how good a company is, we cannot invest at any price.

Kraft Heinz also faces challenges such as a high level of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. Additionally, its products have become less popular in recent years due to new healthier eating trends, causing a slight decrease in income and putting pressure on the company, leading to a sharp fall in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Valuation and Future Outlook

Despite these issues, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] maintains his position, likely due to the company now trading at a very interesting valuation multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. For consumer companies with high debt like Kraft Heinz, the EV/EBITDA valuation ratio is more appropriate as it accounts for the company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Historically, Kraft Heinz has traded at an average of around 14 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. Currently, it is trading below its historical average at 10 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. Given that the company appears to have reduced its debt level and stabilized its revenue and profits, it is reasonable to expect it to return to its historical average valuation in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>. This would imply a target value of $50 per share, compared to its current trading price of $32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.

## Moody's (MCO)

Moody's is another significant holding in [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy | Warren Buffett's portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $7 billion, representing more than 3% of his total [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy | portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. The stock is listed in the US under the ticker MCO and is priced at $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:27">[00:20:27]</a>.

### Ideal Investment Characteristics

Moody's exemplifies the type of ideal investment favored by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It possesses a dominant market position, is minimally affected by economic crises, maintains high profit margins, and exhibits very predictable growth in earnings per share over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>. Even during the 2020 crisis, Moody's was able to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>.

Moody's, along with Standard & Poor's and Fitch, controls the oligopoly of debt rating agencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. Their market power is so substantial that they publicly declare annual price increases for their clients, who have no alternative due to a lack of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. As an unregulated sector, these companies have delivered exceptional stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

### Valuation and Growth Potential

Historically, Moody's has traded on the stock market at approximately 25 times earnings, which aligns with its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The company has demonstrated impressive growth, increasing its earnings per share at a rate of over 15% per year over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. It is estimated that Moody's can maintain this growth rate for the next five years, potentially earning around $20 per share by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>.

Applying its historical valuation of 25 times earnings, this would result in a target price of $500 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:50">[00:21:50]</a>. Compared to its current price of $270, this suggests a potential return of 100%, equivalent to a 15% average annual compound return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. This aligns with [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett's]] publicly stated minimum return objective for his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, which likely explains his continued holding of Moody's shares.

These two investments, despite their differing performances and characteristics within [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy | Warren Buffett's portfolio]], offer valuable insights into his diverse [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | investment strategies]], from acknowledging past mistakes to identifying high-quality businesses with strong growth prospects and attractive valuations.

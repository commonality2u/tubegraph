The 2020 annual conference of Warren Buffett, a renowned investor, provided insights into how changes in the airline and oil markets impact investment strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Buffett's actions and commentary revealed a cautious stance on these sectors during a period of significant economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Cautious Stance and Market Volatility

Warren Buffett conveyed a message of caution, not only through his words but also by his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:00">[01:01:00]</a>. During the first quarter of 2020, he was a net seller of stocks and did not acquire new investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway's liquidity increased from $120 trillion to over $130 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.

Buffett noted the unprecedented nature of voluntarily closing a substantial part of society, stating there's no reference to a similar event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. He characterized the situation as a "great experiment" with an enormous range of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:00">[01:37:00]</a>. While confident in the long-term potential of the country and the American stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>, he warned that in the short term, investors must be prepared for anything and that "very flying moments" might be approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

His actions suggest an expectation of more [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | volatility]] in the coming months, prompting him to accumulate extra liquidity and await a more opportune time for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.

## Impact of Airlines on Investments

A major surprise from Buffett's conference was the sale of his entire position in the four major American airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. This divestment represented a combined investment of over $10 billion in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Reasons for Divestment
Buffett explained that the "airline business has changed significantly" because people have been told not to fly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>. He noted that these companies would have to borrow over $10 trillion each and repay that money using future profits, or by selling shares, which drastically reduces their investment potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. He estimated it would take "two or three years to get back to last year's passenger numbers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. Buffett underscored that when he identifies a mistake in a position, he sells it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>. Following this news, major airlines saw their stock prices fall by over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

### Boeing's Specific Situation
Warren Buffett also discussed Boeing, highlighting the rapid deterioration of its financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:49:00">[07:49:00]</a>. Boeing had to request $25 billion days prior to the conference, in addition to an earlier $14 billion request <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Just a year before, the company felt it was in a solid financial position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>.

Boeing faces two primary challenges:
1.  **Reduced Demand**: The current global situation is expected to affect demand for new aircraft for the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:00">[17:18:00]</a>. Air traffic is estimated to fall by 20% in 2020 and not recover to pre-crisis levels until 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a>.
2.  **737 Max Issues**: Design problems with the 737 Max led to two fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>.

These factors rapidly transformed Boeing from a solvent company to one facing serious financial trouble, requiring nearly $30 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:34:00">[17:34:00]</a>. Despite these issues, the current problems are expected to dissipate, and aviation will eventually return to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:46:00">[17:46:00]</a>. Design problems are also common in the industry and are solvable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:00">[17:58:00]</a>. Analysts estimate Boeing could be earning $12 per share by 2022, potentially leading to a target price of $240 per share, assuming historical trading patterns (P/E of 20) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:28:00">[19:28:00]</a>. However, increased debt significantly raises investment risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:00">[19:46:00]</a>.

## Impact of Oil Market Changes on Investments

Warren Buffett also shared his perspective on the oil market and its [[impact_of_oil_price_fluctuations_on_the_global_economy | impact on the global economy]]. He observed an excess of oil production coupled with low demand, exacerbated by competition between Russia and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.

He stated that oil production in the U.S. is expected to drop significantly because it is "not profitable to extract oil at current prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>. Buffett noted that in many places, extracting oil is unprofitable below $40 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. While this should reduce supply, prices are not expected to rise as long as demand remains depressed due to the ongoing global problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. This perspective likely explains Buffett's lack of investments in oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

Recently, a new risk to the stock market, termed the "reverse crisis," has emerged, posing a significant challenge to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This scenario, increasingly likely, could silently erode capital and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. [[Warren Buffett]], along with other prominent investors like Bill Ackman and Stanley Druckenmiller, have already cautioned about this new market situation, while the majority appears to be overlooking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Understanding the Reverse Crisis and Inflation
A reverse financial crisis is intrinsically linked to inflation and the decisions made by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Central banks have consistently flooded the financial system with new currency as a solution to financial crises since 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For instance, in 2020, 22% of all dollars currently in circulation were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This continuous practice, coupled with governments spending more than they collect in taxes, leads to increased debt, weakening currency, and higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This has contributed to one of the largest inflation crises in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

In a reverse crisis, similar to how product and service prices escalate during non-stop inflation, investments also experience a rapid, seemingly endless climb <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While this might appear beneficial, it is dangerous because it often leads to a loss of real purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. This phenomenon has already been observed in stock markets in countries like Argentina, Turkey, and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

### Nominal vs. Real Return
To grasp the concept of an inverse financial crisis, it's crucial to distinguish between nominal return and real return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. A nominal return is the percentage increase in an investment, while the real return accounts for inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. For example, if an investment yields a 10% nominal return but inflation is 15%, the real return is a negative 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. This means purchasing power has been lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### Causes and Anticipation
These processes are closely related to negative real interest rates, which occur when inflation is higher than the interest rate set by the central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This was observed in Argentina for 12 years with an average negative real interest rate of 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>, and also in Europe and the United States in 2021 and 2022, with negative real rates of 3-4% over 12-24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

A significant concern among large investors is the potential for a second, more severe wave of inflation, especially as central banks plan to reduce interest rates and governments continue to run large fiscal deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Apollo Group predicts a new increase in inflation and negative real interest rates within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett]] highlighted the problem of government fiscal deficits in his 2024 annual letter to investors, stating that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. He also warned that "extreme inflation is always a possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy]] in Inflationary Environments
During periods of inflation, investing in stocks is generally more logical than bonds, as bonds tend to suffer from negative real rates, leading to a reduction in purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>.

While some sectors like gold miners and real estate (REITs) might perform well during very high inflation, they are generally considered lower-quality businesses with higher volatility and poor performance in normal market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy]] takes a different approach to this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. When asked how he would invest in an environment of future inflation, he emphasized:
> "The best businesses are those that require little investment and that their strength is based on a brand. It is wonderful to own a business with a brand during an inflation crisis." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy]] values businesses with strong brands or competitive advantages because they possess "pricing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This is a critical characteristic in inflationary environments, as it allows companies to raise prices at a rate equal to or greater than inflation, thus increasing profits even as costs rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. These businesses tend to reflect this value creation and protect investors from inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Furthermore, these types of businesses have historically shown good performance even outside of reverse crises, providing consistent and predictable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This approach allows investors to build a portfolio prepared for various economic environments without needing to predict specific economic or central bank decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

### Companies with Pricing Power
A list compiled by Credit Suisse identifies large-cap stocks with significant pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. This list includes iconic names with strong brands, such as:
*   Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>
*   Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>
*   Campbell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>
*   Philip Morris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>
*   Dollar General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>
*   Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>

[[Warren Buffett]] himself has invested in many of the companies appearing on this list, which have performed well in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.

[[Bill Gates investment portfolio | Bill Gates]], one of the world's richest and most powerful individuals, has recently issued warnings about a new threat that he believes could jeopardize the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. In response, he has rapidly begun to [[reasons_behind_bill_gates_selling_his_shares | sell shares from his portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This move suggests a belief that the upcoming risk could be worse than recent crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. His [[analysis_of_bill_gates_portfolio_changes | investment strategies]] are closely watched globally due to his high percentage of success and deep knowledge of technology and other economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Predictive Acumen and Investment Philosophy

[[Bill Gates]] has a history of foresight, having warned in 2019 about a crisis similar to the one experienced, a warning that went unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He also predicted how that crisis could be resolved, again without attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. His investment eye has been "excellent," as evidenced by his early investments in companies like Novavax and BioNTech <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He even predicted that Pfizer and BioNTech would be the first to develop a solution to a global problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

While [[Bill Gates]] founded Microsoft, shares in the company now represent only 2% of his total assets, as he has [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes and strategies | diversified a large portion of his wealth]] into other sectors and publicly listed shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

## Recent Warnings and Concerns

During the annual security conference in Munich, [[Bill Gates]] stated that "it is certain that we will have another pandemic in the future, only this time it will be with a different pathogen" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He also expressed concerns about:
*   Public distrust in governments, which could hinder a rapid response (less than 6 months needed) to a future crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   The divisive impact of social networks on society and the economy, suggesting they need regulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### The "New Threat"

[[Bill Gates]] has voiced significant concern about "terrorist attacks related to smallpox strains that could be spread massively in airports, stadiums, or shopping centers" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He has urged governments to create a common fund of over $1 billion annually for the control and monitoring of this risk, believing it could have "serious effects on society and the global economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

## Portfolio Changes: Selling Trends

In response to these perceived risks, [[Bill Gates]] has acted decisively, making his [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investments public]] due to U.S. stock market transparency rules for investors with over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. His most recent report shows he has sold 12 of the 18 shares in his portfolio and has not bought any new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>. This accelerated selling strategy is explained by his concerns that "we may not yet have seen the worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>.

His selling strategy has focused on three key areas:

1.  **Cyclical Companies**: He has sold shares in cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. These stocks are highly sensitive to the economic cycle and tend to fall sharply during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
2.  **Technology Companies**:
    *   **Google**: He sold all his shares in Google, one of the few technology companies he still held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Following this communication, Google shares plummeted over 25% in less than 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.
    *   **Alibaba**: Last year, he divested from all his Alibaba shares when they were trading at $225 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. A year later, they trade at less than $90, proving to be a "very wise move" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.
    *   **General Tech Exposure**: Reducing exposure to technology companies has been beneficial, as the Nasdaq technology index plummeted over 30% in the first five months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. The only technology company he still holds in his portfolio is Microsoft, comprising barely 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.
3.  **Transportation Sector**: He sold shares related to the transportation sector, which had performed excellently but, in his view, reached a peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. Specifically, he sold shares of UPS and FedEx <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He also sold shares of Canadian Pacific Railway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.
4.  **Betting Against Tesla**: [[Bill Gates]] has started "betting against" [[investment_opportunities_bill_gates_is_optimistic_about | Tesla]] shares, despite being a strong advocate for climate change and renewable energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He also drives a Porsche Taycan, a competitor to [[investment_opportunities_bill_gates_is_optimistic_about | Tesla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. [[investment_opportunities_bill_gates_is_optimistic_about | Tesla]] shares have plummeted over 50% recently, validating his view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. One possible reason for this decision is [[investment_opportunities_bill_gates_is_optimistic_about | Tesla]]'s high valuation, trading at over 50 times earnings compared to the market average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. He understands that a "good company" is not always a "good investment," recalling Microsoft's 50% plummet during the 2000 tech bubble despite growth expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.
5.  **Walmart**: He has also started selling shares of Walmart, which has seen its stock collapse due to supply chain issues and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

## Current Portfolio: Remaining Investments

Despite concerns about the economy, [[Bill Gates]] remains invested to counter inflation's impact on purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The few stocks he has kept are from "very predictable and very defensive sectors," designed to be least affected during an economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.

### Ecolab (ECL)
*   **Sector**: Water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: High competitive advantage based on reputation and long operating history, making it difficult for competitors to steal market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Multiplied by over 20 times on the stock market over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. Demonstrated consistent earnings per share growth of over 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Showed excellent performance during crises like 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Outlook**: Expected to benefit from new regulations on water treatment and environmental respect, projecting higher growth rates of over 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trades at 29 times earnings for the next 12 months, comparing favorably to its 5-year average of 33 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Waste Management (WM)
*   **Sector**: Leading garbage collection company in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Alignment**: A "very predictable, traditional sector and very resistant to crises," aligning with [[Bill Gates]]' negative view for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Outlook**: Will benefit from the trend towards waste recycling and environmental respect, with the market expected to grow at 9% in the coming years, especially in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Has a high competitive advantage; once it controls a region, it's very difficult for other companies to compete <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Multiplied by over 60 times on the stock market over the last few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Shares have been saved from the recent bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading at its historical average valuation of around 26 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Other Kept Investments
*   **Canadian Pacific**: While he sold Canadian Pacific Railway shares earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, [[Bill Gates]] has also decided to keep shares of Canadian Pacific in his investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola FEMSA**: The national bottler of Coca-Cola for Mexico, another "very defensive and very predictable business" that aligns with his more conservative investment attitude <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

## Other Major Investments

Outside of the stock market, [[Bill Gates]] has engaged in the [[bill_gates_investment_in_arable_land | massive accumulation of farmland]], becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. This move proved successful, preceding the recent rise in food prices and global inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

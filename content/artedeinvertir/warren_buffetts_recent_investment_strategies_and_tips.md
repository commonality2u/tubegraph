[[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] has recently stated that the next crisis is "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. In response to this outlook, he has provided new tips on how to adapt to situations involving inflation and other risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He has also made significant acquisitions of shares to prepare for these economic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Current Economic Environment: Inflation and Crisis Outlook

[[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] observes "substantial price increases" related to inflation, which is being accepted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He noted that steel prices are rising daily, and the economy is "very overheated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

Examples of inflation's impact include:
*   Walmart struggling to find truck drivers and offering salaries up to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   Plumbers in the US earning $100,000 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   Shortages in certain sectors due to recent movements and confinements, leading to higher transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.

Buffett warns that inflation is higher and will continue to be higher than people anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He foresees a second wave of inflation in 2023 when wages rise due to updates with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The easiest solution to this problem, according to Buffett, will be the devaluation of the dollar and euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This means that holding dollars or euros, or investments in liquidity, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits, is "very bad news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. Governments want to devalue currency to manage debt; they increase income via inflation while their debt levels remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Wealth Transfer
The situation involving confinement and fiscal stimuli has led to the "largest transfer of wealth in history," effectively a "gigantic robbery of the middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Fiscal stimuli in the US and Europe are financed by new debt and printed money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This debt is ultimately paid by the middle class through taxes on consumption, gasoline, salaries, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

The printed money and public spending channeled through recovery plans (e.g., almost two trillion euros in Europe until 2027) benefit companies that build infrastructure, provide digitalization services, or offer cloud computing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This prosperity is reflected in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Therefore, only those with productive assets like stock market investments will see their wealth increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>. If one is not investing, they will not benefit, but will pay the bill for the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

### Consequences of Money Printing
[[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] stated that "all actions have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, and it is "crazy to think that 85 percent of the American population has received these checks for 1,400 dollars" without repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The tremendous printing of money has caused the debt levels of the world's four main economies to rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. This leads to rising stock markets, company benefits, increased spending, and reduced interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies | Investment Strategies]]

The only way to avoid losing value in the current environment is to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Avoiding "Conservative" Investments
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and liquidity accumulation | Warren Buffett]] believes that having money quietly deposited in a bank, or invested in a bond or treasury bill, is not conservative and carries significant risk due to currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. He compares buying a 10-year bond today that yields 2% to "paying 50 times earnings for a business" that won't grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. In contrast, a company like Visa, trading at 28 times earnings, offers an immediate 3% return and grows profits at over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>. This results in a total annual profitability of 13% for Visa, compared to 2% for a bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.

### Productive Assets vs. Gold
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] consistently advocates for owning productive assets over non-productive ones like gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. He noted that if you own an ounce of gold, "it will continue to be an ounce of gold" eternally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>. However, productive assets like stocks, real estate, or farmland generate income or dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Gold does not produce anything and does not multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

While gold tends to retain its value during inflation because it cannot be printed like fiat money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, well-managed companies do not dilute shares, thus increasing the value of existing shares as the company grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. Some companies can even buy back and eliminate their own shares, further concentrating value for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>.

### Investing in Yourself
[[Warren Buffetts investment principles for beginners | Warren Buffett]] also advises investing in oneself, particularly through education to improve skills in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:39">[00:40:39]</a>. By being "above average" in one's profession, one adds value and will fare well, regardless of currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies | Key Investment Criteria]]

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]] emphasizes investing in "fabulous businesses" that generate "tons of cash flow" and "do not require capital," meaning they have low levels of reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Reinvestment levels below 20% are considered "quite good," while businesses requiring 50-70% reinvestment are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.

Another characteristic [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and cash reserves | Warren Buffett]] favors is consistent share buybacks, especially when shares are trading below their historical average multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This cannibalizes the company, making long-term shareholders own a larger piece of a valuable and profitable pie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>.

### Recent Acquisitions and Portfolio Examples

*   **HP Inc.**: Recently, [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] made a large acquisition of almost $5 billion in HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. HP fits his criteria:
    *   Generates significant cash flow (e.g., $6 billion in cash flow with only $580 million reinvestment in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.
    *   Actively buys back shares (e.g., $6 billion in the last two years, withdrawing 15% of the company's stock) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>.
    *   While its printer cartridge business is declining, its personal computer and peripheral segment is growing, and the printing part is becoming a smaller percentage of total revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>.

*   **Occidental Petroleum (Oxy)**: This is the only oil company [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] recently invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. He noted that the company is channeling its earnings into share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:54">[00:28:54]</a>.

*   **Other Core Holdings**: Companies like Apple, Moody's, and Bank of America are also systematically buying back shares, sharing a similar investment profile favoured by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### Examples of Companies Fitting Buffett's Criteria

*   **Starbucks (SBUX)**: The founder's return to the company and a recent price drop make it an interesting investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:36">[00:32:36]</a>. Starbucks can raise prices, requires little reinvestment (around 20% of earnings), and has engaged in share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. The impact of rising coffee prices on its profitability is minimal due to high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.

*   **C.H. Robinson (CHRW)**: This logistics broker doesn't own trucks or planes but connects companies needing transport with carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. It's highly protected against inflation because it charges a percentage on transportation costs; as rates go up, its revenue increases without a proportional rise in its own minimal costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. It has low reinvestment needs (only 10% of cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>.

*   **Google (GOOGL)**: Mentioned by Buffett as a "fabulous business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>, Google generates high cash flow while only reinvesting 20-27% of its income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. It has a strong competitive position and actively repurchases shares, such as $50 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:23">[00:51:23]</a>.

*   **Darling Ingredients**: This company, which manufactures ingredients for food, has shown strong growth in earnings per share (16% annually) and stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:50">[00:55:50]</a>.

*   **Givaudan (formerly Robert &)**: A Swiss company manufacturing essences for perfumes, it operates in a market where reputation is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. It has high profit margins (16% operating profit) and low reinvestment needs (e.g., $28 million reinvested from $114 million cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. This allows it to raise prices with inflation without significant cost increases.

*   **Restaurant Brands International (RBI)**: This company, which benefits from inflation, does not own restaurants but receives royalties from franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. If franchisees raise menu prices due to inflation, RBI's royalty income increases without absorbing the costs of making the food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. It has very high profit margins (24% EBITDA) and extremely low reinvestment needs (e.g., $6 million invested from $140 million cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

## Companies to Approach with Caution

*   **Iberdrola (Utility Companies)**: While they can raise electricity prices with inflation, they have significant reinvestment needs (e.g., Iberdrola reinvests 70% of its operating profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. This high capital expenditure means their profits may not increase substantially even with rising prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

*   **Micron (Cyclical Businesses)**: As a manufacturer of RAM memories, Micron's business is cyclical, with volatile turnover and normalized profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. It also requires substantial reinvestment (e.g., $10 billion to generate $12 billion in income in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.

*   **Companies Not Making Money**: Investing in companies that are not yet profitable is "tremendously complex" because it requires accurately predicting both future growth and profit margins, which is unreliable beyond a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

## Debunking Investment Myths

*   **Professional Investors and Information Access**: The idea that professional investors like [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] have more information or speak with management before investing is a "huge myth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. Buffett consistently uses the same public information available to everyone, such as conference call transcripts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a>. The goal is to make objective, impartial decisions based on facts, avoiding external influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:51">[01:03:51]</a>. Investing with privileged information is unethical and punishable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

Ray Dalio, a renowned economist and investor, has forecast significant changes in the global economic landscape, which he believes will affect everyone equally, regardless of their investment habits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He has provided a specific timeline for these shifts, stating they will have serious implications for currency values (like the dollar and euro), real estate, and [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation and the cost of living]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Dalio has warned that this new economic scenario will be the most substantial societal and economic change in the last century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Influence and Predictions

Ray Dalio is a highly influential figure in economics, managing over $100 billion through his company, Bridgewater, making it the world's largest investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The assets he manages surpass the gross domestic product of some countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:00">[01:25:00]</a>. He has a proven track record of accurately predicting major economic changes, having protected his portfolios during crises such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2000 dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Having become a multimillionaire, Dalio has publicly shared his research on the economy in his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>, aiming to alert society to adapt to the impending economic reality to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>.

In a recent interview, Dalio revealed the specific date he believes these economic changes will commence, along with their underlying causes and triggering events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Converging Problems: Monetary Issues, Inequality, and Geopolitical Shifts

Dalio identifies three interconnected problems that, when combined, create an even larger challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:

### 1. Monetary Problems and the Debt Cycle
The first issue is a monetary problem tied to the debt cycle, leading to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. The US, in particular, is in a "terminal phase of the credit cycle," producing excessive debt and printing vast amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Historically, the US could issue debt and print new dollars to repay it without causing its currency to collapse because of its dominant global economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in terms of GDP, military strength, technological innovation, and global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

During the 2020 crisis, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. Dalio posits that if, during the next crisis, people lose confidence in the dollar, the usual "recipe" of printing more money will no longer work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>.

### 2. [[class_struggle_and_wealth_inequality | Social Inequality]]
Compounding the monetary problem is a significant [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | social inequality]], which contributes to societal and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. Dalio states that this [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | inequality between classes]] fuels the rise of populist parties, which will negatively impact economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

Data indicates that 90% of the American population increasingly owns less wealth, with a mere 10% owning 75% of the wealth in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this issue as governments issued substantial debt to stabilize the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This debt, he notes, will primarily be repaid through taxes on the working class, who did not benefit from the recent economic boom characterized by significant increases in housing values, stock market investments, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### 3. Geopolitical Power Shifts
The third problem is the United States' declining competitive advantage in favor of China, which will have severe consequences for the West and its wealth levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. China is projected to surpass the United States in terms of gross domestic product around 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>.

Dalio predicts that within five years, foreigners who currently lend money to the United States may cease to do so, and the dollar may no longer be universally accepted for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. He warns that because society has been spending more than it earned, difficult times will lead to internal conflict, with the poor seeking more from the rich, and the rich attempting to protect their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This implies a significant global transformation within the next five years, necessitating immediate action to protect savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

## Economic Phases and Investor Guidance

Ray Dalio's research suggests that economies follow two fundamental phases: rise and decline, each characterized by specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. He illustrates that the US is entering a decline phase, marked by high debt levels and alarming money printing, while China is in an ascending phase characterized by wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

When asked for the smartest decision for small investors to protect their savings and capitalize on future opportunities, Dalio offered key advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>:

### 1. Avoid Holding Excessive Liquidity
Dalio advises against holding significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. In an environment of extensive money printing, [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]] inevitably emerges, eroding purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>. Therefore, individuals are compelled to become investors, whether in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### 2. Diversify Effectively
Diversification is crucial, encompassing different countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The goal is for one asset to perform well when another declines, ensuring overall portfolio stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Dalio's "four seasons portfolio" theory emphasizes structuring a portfolio to withstand both favorable and unfavorable economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a>.

His recommended asset allocation includes:
*   **40% in stocks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>. In the current economic climate, characterized by high but expected-to-drop [[understanding_inflation_and_its_potential_crisis_implications | inflation]], emerging market stocks and small-cap stocks tend to perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>. Dalio's own portfolio reflects this, with three of his top five investments being ETFs related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Small-cap stocks, while potentially very lucrative due to greater growth potential and less market following, are less accessible to large investors like Dalio due to liquidity constraints <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.
*   **A small percentage (under 10%) in gold** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>. This can be achieved through ETFs tracking gold mining companies or physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds (under 40%)**, including inflation-protected bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. Bonds offer a defensive component to a portfolio, tending to perform well when stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. However, Dalio notes a "bubble" in the bond market due to extensive money printing by governments, leading him to adopt a more conservative asset allocation in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

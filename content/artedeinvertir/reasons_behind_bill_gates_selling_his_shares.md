[[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]], one of the world's richest and most influential individuals, has recently begun selling his shares on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The reasons behind this movement are notable, as he has stated that a new crisis is "practically certain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Acumen
[[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] has amassed a fortune exceeding $120 billion, positioning him as the fourth richest person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While widely recognized for co-founding Microsoft, he is also an accomplished investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Currently, Microsoft shares constitute only 40% of his investments, with the remaining 60% diversified across a [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio of stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. His demonstrated expertise in economics and the stock market lends significance to his recent [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment portfolio changes]] and statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

## Predictions and Economic Outlook
[[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] has a history of significant predictions. He warned about the likelihood of a pandemic similar to the one experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a> and accurately predicted which company would develop the first vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

During a recent Q&A session, when asked about the possibility of a new economic crisis comparable to 2008, he responded that it is "certain that we will have a crisis similar to that of 2008 in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He also indicated that the current economic issues could persist longer than anticipated, potentially lasting until the end of 2022, contrary to a popular belief of it ending in late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:00:00">[13:00:00]</a>. This conservative view about the future of the economy is a key driver for his [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment adjustments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Transparency
Due to stock market transparency rules, professional investors managing portfolios exceeding $100 million are required to periodically report their stock holdings, purchases, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This information allows for deductions about the outlook of major investors on the future of the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>.

## Key Reasons for Selling Shares
An [[analysis_of_bill_gates_portfolio_changes | analysis of Bill Gates' portfolio changes]] reveals a significant shift, with 11 of his 18 stock holdings being sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:00">[03:02:00]</a>.

### Pandemic's Prolonged Impact
In a February interview with CNN, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] expressed concern that the current problem could endure longer than expected, leading to severe economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>. He highlighted the main risk to the economy: vaccines not reaching rich countries, increasing the risk of new variants spreading globally and returning to the US, causing new infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:18:00">[03:18:00]</a>.

### Divesting from Technology and High-Valuation Stocks
[[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | Bill Gates' investment activity]] shows three key factors:
*   **Selling Technology Stocks**: He has sold all his technology stocks, including Amazon, Google, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. These companies had been major beneficiaries of the recent economic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Selling Uber Shares**: Shares of Uber were sold due to their very high valuation and fragility during an economic downturn, given that they do not produce profits and investor expectations were very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.
*   **Selling Alibaba Shares**: All shares in the Alibaba company were sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>. While Alibaba is considered an excellent company with good growth prospects, recent problems with the Chinese regulator caused panic among investors, leading to a sharp fall in shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. Although delisting from US exchanges or profitability-affecting actions are unlikely ("tail risk"), such possibilities carry serious consequences for stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:16:00">[05:16:00]</a>.

## Positioning for the "Great Rotation"
[[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | Bill Gates' portfolio]] appears to be positioning for what is termed the "great rotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>. This involves a shift of capital from disruptive or technological companies (which have seen strong revaluations in the last three years) to more traditional and conservative companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. These traditional companies are currently trading at attractive valuations due to previously low interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>.

Furthermore, he has chosen to concentrate his investments in defensive or crisis-resistant traditional stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Examples of companies he remains optimistic about and continues to hold include:
*   **Berkshire Hathaway**: Warren Buffett's business holding company, representing 43% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. It is positioned to withstand any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:18:00">[07:18:00]</a>.
*   **Waste Management**: The leading US waste collection and recycling company, representing 10% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. This is a traditional, crisis-resilient, and predictable company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:36:00">[08:36:00]</a>.
*   **Walmart**: The largest supermarket chain globally, with 9% of his portfolio, known as a conservative company that performs well in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.
*   **Canadian National Railway**: A safe investment within the transportation sector due to the unlikelihood of rival companies building parallel railway lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>.
*   **Blue-chip companies**: High-quality companies like FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:13:00">[11:13:00]</a>.

In addition to selling, [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] also made one new significant investment: Schr√∂dinger, an American company in biotechnology, which helps pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs or vaccines. He invested over $500 million in this highly innovative company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>. This highlights a selective approach even within high-growth potential sectors.

This conservative view about the future of the economy is a primary reason that led [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]] and his portfolio manager to make these significant [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment changes]] for the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:12:00">[13:12:00]</a>.

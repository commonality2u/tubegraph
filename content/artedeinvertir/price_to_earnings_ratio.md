The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio is a fundamental metric used in [[Valuation metrics and considerations for stock investments | stock valuation]] to determine how much an investment is worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. It is the most common method for valuing shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The core principle of successful investment is to pay less than what an asset is estimated to be worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Formula and Calculation

The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the current stock price by the company's annual earnings per share, also known as the net accounting profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. Alternatively, it can be calculated using the company's market capitalization (total value of outstanding shares) divided by its total annual earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

### Example: Inditex

If Inditex is listed at 27 euros per share and is expected to earn approximately one euro per share this year, its P/E ratio would be 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

## Interpretation of the P/E Ratio

### Market Averages

The average P/E ratio for the stock market typically ranges from 15 to 16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. The American market currently trades at approximately 18 times, while the European market is around 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### P/E and Growth Expectations

A high P/E multiple, like Inditex's 27, indicates that investors are anticipating significant future growth in the company's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If Inditex's earnings per share were projected to double to two euros in three to five years, its effective P/E would reduce to 13 times, making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. This concept is part of [[Evaluating growth rates and market expectations | evaluating growth rates and market expectations]].

Conversely, a low P/E might suggest that investors expect future earnings to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Such companies can be considered "value traps" if earnings indeed fall, meaning an investor pays more relative to future profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. For large-cap companies trading at low P/E ratios, the market is often anticipating a future problem that may not yet be apparent to the investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.

### Contrarian Investment

A low P/E can also present a contrarian investment opportunity, where an investor believes the market's concerns about future events are unfounded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. Buying such a company at a low P/E, expecting it to revert to the market average (e.g., 15-16 times), can yield a significant return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

### Industry Variations

Different industries typically trade at different P/E multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Automotive companies or airlines: Rarely trade above 8-10 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.
*   High-quality companies: Often listed above 18-20 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### P/E and Return on Investment

A P/E ratio can be inversely related to the return on investment. For example, buying a company at a P/E of 10 times can be equivalent to an annual return of 10% (or recovering the investment in 10 years), assuming the company's profits remain stable and all profits are paid out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. If a business is bought at a P/E of 20, it suggests an approximate 5% annual return if profits do not grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This calculation is derived by taking the inverse of the P/E ratio (1/P/E) and multiplying by 100 to get a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

Studies show that buying companies with low P/E ratios (value investing) has historically yielded higher returns (around 12-13%) compared to the average market return (9-8%) over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. This approach aims to constantly buy assets for less than their listed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Limitations of the P/E Ratio

A significant limitation of the P/E ratio is that it does not account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. When using P/E, only the net profit is considered, neglecting whether the company is highly leveraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This can lead to low P/E values for companies with substantial debt, which might be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. It only values the equity or net worth of the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

## Variations of P/E

### Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF)

The Price to Free Cash Flow is a variation of the P/E ratio that considers free cash flow instead of net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. Free cash flow is a more refined measure of profit that accounts for depreciation and capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. Like the P/E, it also looks at net profit without considering the company's leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:49">[00:26:49]</a>. It is considered a valid method that yields good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:53">[00:26:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

## Usage in Valuation

The P/E ratio is best used for relative valuation, comparing similar companies within the same industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. For example, if McDonald's trades at 15 times earnings, and Burger King, a similar company, is available at 10 times earnings, they should eventually converge in valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Companies with competitive advantages, like strong brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, McDonald's, Procter & Gamble), typically trade at higher multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

Other methods, such as [[discounted_cash_flow_analysis | discounted cash flow analysis]] or valuation by multiples like EV/EBITDA, often provide a more comprehensive picture by accounting for debt and capital structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

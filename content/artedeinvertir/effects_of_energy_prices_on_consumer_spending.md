The rise in energy prices significantly impacts consumer spending by reducing the amount of disposable income available to households <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This situation is worsened by existing supply crises and [[role_of_energy_prices_and_inflation_in_current_economic_conditions | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>, leading to a severe economic impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

## Impact on Disposable Income
Higher energy costs mean that consumers have less money left over after essential expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. For example:
*   **Gas Prices** In Europe, gas prices skyrocketed, exacerbating the existing [[energy_crisis_and_its_impact_on_inflation | energy crisis and its impact on inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>.
*   **Oil Prices** The price of oil nearly reached $100, up from $50 a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. This leads to more expensive gasoline and overall energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

The German minister noted that while supply of gas is secure, the price at which it must be paid poses a serious problem for all European consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:00">[06:03:00]</a>.

## Economic Consequences
With reduced disposable income, consumer spending declines. Since consumption accounts for approximately 70% of the economy, a decrease in available funds due to rising energy costs can have severe repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>. This economic pressure is aggravated by conflicts, which further drives up energy expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. Ultimately, high energy costs affect the entire global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

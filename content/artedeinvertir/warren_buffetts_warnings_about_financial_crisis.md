[[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]], often referred to as the "Oracle of Omaha," is widely considered the greatest investor of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. He is reportedly preparing for a financial crisis and has issued an important warning message to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Historically, he has rarely issued such messages, and the previous two instances were followed by significant setbacks in both the stock market and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The current warning marks the third time he has taken such drastic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Warnings

Over 50 years, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] has only twice before taken measures like rapidly selling stocks and issuing caution messages to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. On both occasions, the market fell over 40%, and the economy suffered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### First Warning: Early Career (Partnerships)

The first time [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] issued a warning and sold shares was at the beginning of his career as a manager of investment funds (partnerships) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. After 13 successful years with annual returns exceeding 30%, he declared that the economy faced significant challenges and stock market valuations were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Despite widespread belief that the market would continue to rise, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] accumulated cash and eventually returned all money to his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Shortly after, the stock market fell by 20%, accumulating nearly 50% declines over the next four years, and the economy entered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Second Warning: 1999 (Dot-Com Bubble)

Thirty years after his initial warning, in 1999, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] took similar measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. He warned of "enormous euphoria" in the stock market, unsustainable valuations, and an economic environment with significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Six months after his warning, the internet bubble ended, major stock markets plummeted by over 45%, and the Nasdaq technology index fell by more than 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. The US and European economies entered a recession 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## The Current (Third) Warning

Now, 25 years later, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] has issued his third warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

### Actions Taken by Berkshire Hathaway

[[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] is rapidly selling his stocks to build up a cash cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. His holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, currently holds over $300 billion in liquidity, making it the most liquid and cash-rich company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This amount of money could buy 100% ownership of companies like Netflix, Starbucks, McDonald's, or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Sectors Being Sold

[[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] has focused on reducing exposure to the financial and banking sectors, notably selling historic companies like Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. These sectors are highly sensitive to an economic recession, confirming his cautious view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He has also sold off his real estate companies and no longer holds companies in the industrial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Although he previously invested in the technology sector with Apple, he has significantly reduced this position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The sectors most affected by a potential crisis include financial, real estate, technology, and industrial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Sectors Being Accumulated

[[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] has expanded his positions in the energy sector, purchasing shares in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. A Fidelity study suggests the energy sector would be one of the least affected in an economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

### Supporting Views

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan and a personal friend of [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]], shares a similar vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. He stated that "the most likely outcome of the current crisis is an economic recession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett's Recent Statements and Investments]]

In his last conference, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] stated, "Given the current circumstances, I am comfortable increasing my cash and liquidity position. When I look at the alternative of investing in the stock market with everything that is happening in the world, it is not an attractive option for me" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

He subtly refers to several global problems:
*   Current tariff issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>
*   Conflicts between China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>
*   Speculation in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   Inflation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>

He also indicates that current stock valuations are too high for the risks involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. He prefers to hold liquidity, earning 5% annually, while waiting for better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

A JP Morgan study on expected stock market performance based on current valuations indicates that the more expensive the starting point for investment, the lower the future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Currently, the expected return for the S&P 500 over the next 10 years is very low, possibly below 5% or even 0% per year, due to valuations ranging between 19 and 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

In a recent letter to investors, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] stated: "In the coming years, we hope to use this liquidity to buy high-quality companies that will remain part of Versair Hawei forever. However, currently, the prices of businesses with good long-term characteristics are sky-high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. He reaffirmed that he would maintain his decisions unless stock valuations fell, even if the return on his liquidity dropped from 4% to 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## [[warren_buffetts_recent_investment_strategies_and_tips | Warren Buffett's Advice for Small Investors]]

When asked what he would do as a small investor in the current environment of high stock market valuations, [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] advised: "I would probably focus on smaller companies where there's a greater chance of finding a good investment. If I had less than a million dollars today, I would be fully invested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. He recommends investing in lesser-known companies, where the probability of finding a cheap company is much higher, even in a more expensive market, providing long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

While indexing (investing in large, well-known companies) has yielded strong results historically and is a valid long-term strategy, the JP Morgan study suggests much lower performance in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. A complementary strategy could be to select individual investments to gain greater control and long-term appreciation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] himself built his fortune by selecting his own investments in lesser-known companies that offered greater appreciation potential at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

### [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett's Investment Keys]]

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett's four keys]] to successful stock market investing are based on buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>:
*   Good businesses with growing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>
*   At attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>
*   With good management who treat shareholders well (e.g., provide dividends, buy back shares, or run the business well) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>

He emphasizes comparing a business's profits with its market value to determine if it's expensive or cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. The stock market, as an aggregate, typically trades at 16 times earnings, but is currently trading at 20 times earnings, which is why [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] believes it is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. His top 10 investments, which generated 80% of his wealth, rarely paid more than 15 times earnings when initiating a position (with Moody's as one exception) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. He remains disciplined, holding liquidity and waiting for better opportunities when he cannot find good investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.

### Opportunities for Private Investors

While [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett's]] investment universe has shrunk due to his immense wealth, limiting him to about 50 companies out of 40,000 listed worldwide, opportunities are abundant for private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. It is easier for private investors to find lesser-known companies with greater growth potential at more attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

Small-cap valuations are currently the most undervalued and attractive segment of the stock market, trading at just 12 times earnings, a nearly 40% discount compared to larger indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Eurostock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Conclusion: Crises as Opportunities

[[warren_buffetts_view_on_the_inevitability_of_a_financial_crisis | Warren Buffett always emphasizes]] that economic crises are inevitable in the future, but they should be viewed as opportunities to make good investments with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

A new risk, termed the "reverse crisis," is emerging for the stock market, which could lead to significant financial gains or losses depending on one's approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">00:00:03</a>. This scenario is becoming increasingly probable and has the potential to erode capital and savings silently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>. The recent actions of central banks and governments are expected to accelerate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">00:00:19</a>. Notable investors such as Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, and Stanley Druckenmiller have already warned about this market situation, while many seem to be overlooking it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">00:00:24</a>.

It is crucial for everyone, whether they invest in the stock market or not, to understand this information as neutrality is not an option in this new environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">00:00:33</a>. This article will explain how to [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | protect your capital and savings]] in this new economic climate and identify [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | investments that could even benefit]] from this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">00:00:41</a>.

## Understanding the Reverse Crisis

A reverse financial crisis is intrinsically linked to inflation and the monetary policies implemented by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">00:00:57</a>. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, have been flooding the financial system with new currency (euros, dollars, pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">00:01:05</a>. Since 2008, the consistent solution to financial crises has been to print new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">00:01:11</a>. For instance, in 2020, to address the crisis, 22% of all dollars currently in circulation were printed in a single year, despite the currency having a 200-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">00:01:21</a>.

Governments increasingly spend more than they collect in taxes, necessitating more borrowing and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">00:01:33</a>. This practice weakens currency and fuels inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">00:01:40</a>. The United States' deficit, at an impressive 8%, is near 2008 crisis levels, contributing to one of the largest inflation crises in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>. This [[adaptation_to_inflationary_risks | radically transforms the economic outlook]] for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>.

### Inflationary Impact on Investments

In a reverse crisis, similar to the rising prices of products and services in an inflationary environment, investments also begin a rapid, seemingly endless ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">00:02:05</a>. While this might appear positive, it is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">00:02:19</a>. This type of crisis has already occurred in major stock markets in countries like Germany, Argentina, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a>.
*   The Merval index in Argentina multiplied by 60 times in the last 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">00:02:31</a>.
*   Turkey's stock market saw a 700% rise in just 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">00:02:36</a>.
*   Germany experienced an 800% rise in less than 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">00:02:40</a>.

To grasp an inverse financial crisis, one must differentiate between nominal and real return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">00:02:46</a>. A nominal return of 10% on an investment (e.g., $10,000 to $11,000) might seem good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">00:02:52</a>. However, if inflation during the same period was 15%, the real return is a negative -5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">00:03:00</a>. This means the price of services and products increased faster than the value of your money, leading to a loss of purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">00:03:13</a>. This silent problem is often ignored until it is too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">00:03:22</a>. People with less financial literacy often suffer the most, bearing the full cost of inflation without benefiting from investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">00:03:31</a>.

As of early 2024, accumulated inflation since 2021 has reached 20% due to government and central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">00:03:53</a>. The S&P 500, which was around 4800 points in 2021, would need to reach 5700 points to compensate for this 20% inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">00:04:06</a>. However, it is currently trading at approximately 5200 points, representing a 10% loss in purchasing power for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">00:04:22</a>. While this is better than not investing (which resulted in a 20% loss), inflation continues to erode purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">00:04:35</a>. This leads to main stock market indices rising strongly, often reaching historical highs due to the reverse crisis effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">00:04:54</a>.

### Negative Real Interest Rates: A Key Driver

Reverse crises are closely tied to negative real interest rates, which occur when the inflation level surpasses the interest rate set by the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">00:05:10</a>. In Argentina, the average real interest rate has been negative (-6%) for the last 12 years, causing severe inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">00:05:22</a>. Europe and the United States experienced similar negative real rates (3-4%) during 2021 and 2022, though for a shorter period (12-24 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">00:05:37</a>.

Many large investors fear a second, more intense wave of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">00:05:55</a>. A study by the Apollo Group indicates that inflation often moves in waves, and when the Fed lowers rates, it tends to raise inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">00:06:03</a>. This pattern was observed in the 1970s and shows a high correlation with today's situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">00:06:16</a>. The Apollo Group estimates a new surge in inflation and negative real interest rates within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">00:06:25</a>.

Compounding this, despite central bank plans to reduce interest rates, governments continue to run large fiscal deficits, spending more than they earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">00:06:39</a>. Warren Buffett has warned about the "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits" and the potential for "extreme inflation" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">00:06:51</a>.

## Investment Strategies During Inflationary Periods

To [[investment_strategies_during_inflationary_periods | navigate with our investments]] in this environment, investing in stocks has been the most logical approach, as bonds tend to suffer in negative real rate environments, leading to reduced purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">00:07:35</a>. However, not just any stock will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">00:07:47</a>. There are primarily two approaches:

### 1. Investing in Specific Inflation-Benefiting Sectors

If high inflation is anticipated, certain sectors are expected to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">00:07:51</a>:
*   **Gold miners** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">00:07:58</a>.
*   **Real estate sector (REITs)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">00:07:59</a>.
Bank of America data suggests that bonds are the only investment category with a negative return relative to inflation, while other sectors provide varying degrees of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">00:08:03</a>.
However, a drawback of these sectors is that if the inflationary scenario does not materialize, they often exhibit poor performance relative to the broader market average due to lower business quality and higher volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">00:08:16</a>.

### 2. Warren Buffett's Approach: Investing in Companies with Pricing Power

Warren Buffett suggests a [[investment_strategies_during_inflationary_periods | different path to face this new problem]]: invest in businesses that require little investment and possess strong brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">00:08:35</a>. Owning a business with a strong brand is particularly advantageous during an inflation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">00:08:51</a>.

Buffett values a brand or a business with a **competitive advantage** because it grants them **pricing power** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">00:08:56</a>. This crucial characteristic allows companies to raise their prices at a rate equal to or greater than inflation, offsetting rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">00:09:07</a>. Consequently, their profits can rise faster than inflation, and their stock market value tends to reflect this value creation, thereby protecting investors from inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">00:09:16</a>.

The advantage of these businesses is that they have consistently performed well on the stock market even when there hasn't been a reverse crisis, providing consistent and predictable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">00:09:26</a>. This strategy allows investors to build a [[strategies_for_investing_in_volatile_economic_environments | portfolio prepared for many economic environments]] without needing to be experts on future economic conditions or central bank decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">00:09:37</a>.

### Companies with High Pricing Power

Credit Suisse has compiled a list of large-cap stocks with significant pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">00:10:03</a>. This list includes iconic names with strong brands like:
*   Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">00:10:14</a>
*   Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">00:10:15</a>
*   Campbell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">00:10:16</a>
*   Philip Morris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">00:10:16</a>
*   Dollar General <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">00:10:18</a>
*   Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">00:10:19</a>

Warren Buffett himself has invested in many companies on this list, which have shown strong performance over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">00:10:20</a>.

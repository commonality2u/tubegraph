Famed economist and investor Ray Dalio has made significant [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | economic predictions]] regarding a profound global shift, which he expects to affect everyone, regardless of their investment activities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He describes the upcoming economic scenario as the "biggest change in society and the economy in the last 100 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. These changes are anticipated to have serious implications for the value of currencies like the dollar and the euro, real estate investments, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Influence and Track Record

Ray Dalio is recognized as one of the most influential figures in the economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. As the manager of Bridgewater, the world's largest investment fund, he oversees more than $100 billion in assets, a figure larger than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of some countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Dalio has a proven track record of accurately predicting major economic changes, which has enabled him to safeguard his investment portfolios through significant crises, such as the 2008 financial crisis and the 2000 technological bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. Having achieved multimillionaire status, Dalio has publicly shared his research on the economy and future outlook in his book, "The New World Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## The Impending Economic Shift and its Triggers

[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions]] indicate that the world is set to change significantly in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. In a recent interview, Dalio pinpointed an "exact date" when he believes these economic changes will commence, detailing the reasons and events that will trigger them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

He identifies three converging problems that, when combined, pose an even greater threat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:

### 1. Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle Coupled with Social Inequality
Dalio highlights a "monetary problem and a debt cycle" alongside a "very large social inequality," which is fueling social and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. This inequality, he argues, will negatively impact economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>. Evidence shows that 90% of the American population owns progressively less wealth, with a mere 10% holding 75% of the wealth in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The crisis in 2020 exacerbated this issue as governments issued significant amounts of debt to save the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This debt, he notes, will primarily be repaid through taxes on the working class, who did not benefit from recent economic booms in housing, stock market investments, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.

### 2. The United States Losing Competitive Advantage to China
The second problem is the United States' declining competitive advantage in favor of China, which will have severe consequences for the West and its wealth levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. Dalio characterizes the US as a "75-year-old empire" exhibiting clear signs of decline, currently in a "terminal phase of the credit cycle" marked by excessive debt production and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Historically, the US could issue debt and print new dollars without currency collapse due to its global economic dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>. However, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in GDP, military strength, technological innovation, and global influence, leading to potential loss of confidence in the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

The solution to past crises has been to print new dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. In 2020 alone, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>. With China expected to surpass the US in GDP around 2030, Dalio predicts a situation within five years where foreign lenders may cease lending to the US, and the dollar may no longer be universally accepted for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### 3. Economic Phases: Decline for US, Ascent for China
Dalio's in-depth study of economies reveals two fundamental phases: rise and decline, each defined by specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>. His charts illustrate the US entering a decline phase, characterized by high debt and alarming quantities of money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Conversely, China is in an ascending phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Investment Advice]] for the Coming Economic Scenario

Ray Dalio advises individuals to act immediately to protect their savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. His key recommendations include:

*   **Avoid Liquidity:** Due to extensive money printing, inflation is inevitable, which reduces purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. This forces everyone to become investors in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Diversify Broadly:** It is crucial to diversify across countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The goal is for one asset to perform well when another declines, ensuring overall portfolio stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### The "Four Seasons Portfolio" Strategy
Dalio's "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory emphasizes preparing an investment portfolio for both good and bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. He recommends the following asset allocation:

*   **40% Stocks:**
    *   In the current economic environment, characterized by high but expected-to-drop inflation, emerging market stocks are the best performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. Ray Dalio's portfolio includes Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Investing in these ETFs allows one to benefit from a basket of stocks representing multiple emerging countries without deep individual knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
    *   Small-cap stocks also perform well in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>. Historically, during similar economic conditions, small-cap stocks have yielded returns greater than 17% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. This is partly because they are less followed by the market, offer greater growth potential than large, globally present companies, and are less accessible to large investors with significant capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Small Percentage (under 10%) Gold:** Gold can be held through ETFs related to gold mining companies or those representing physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds (including inflation-protected bonds):** These should not exceed 40% of investments and provide a defensive component, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. However, Dalio notes a "bubble" in the bond market due to extensive money printing by governments and is applying a more conservative asset allocation to this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

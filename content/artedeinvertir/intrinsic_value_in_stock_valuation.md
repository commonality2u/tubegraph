Understanding [[the_importance_of_understanding_stock_valuation | how to value a stock]] or an investment is one of the most important topics in the [[understanding_stock_market_volatility_and_its_impact_on_stock_valuations | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To be successful in finance and investment, one should strive to pay less than what an asset is truly worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Defining Intrinsic Value

[[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | Intrinsic value]] is a broad concept that academically defines how much something is truly worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. For a stock like Microsoft, an image might show the stock price line (in red) and the [[importance_of_intrinsic_value_in_investing | intrinsic value]] line, which is calculated using different methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The goal is to buy a stock when its price is below its estimated [[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. The greater this difference, the better the potential return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

If a good [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] job is done, the market will eventually reflect the correct value within one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, many investors lack the patience for this time horizon, leading to suboptimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

### Academic Definition: Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)

The academic definition of [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | intrinsic value]] is based on what is called **Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This method involves discounting a company's future earnings throughout its life at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

*   **Formula:** `Cash Flow (Period N) / (1 + Discount Rate)^N` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>
    *   `Cash Flow`: Cash flow the company will produce in a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
    *   `Discount Rate (R)`: The appropriate rate for discounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
    *   `N`: The number of periods, which causes further-out cash flows to have less weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

*   **Limitations:**
    *   Investing is an art, not an exact science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.
    *   It's impossible to accurately predict a company's earnings 10 or 15 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   The profits of the next five years have a very small impact (10-20%) on the final [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
    *   While scientific, this method has limited practical application in the real world due to its predictive nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Valuation by Multiples

Since the DCF method is not always reliable for practical purposes, [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | valuation by multiples]] is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This approach aims to predict what a business will earn in a more visible timeframe (e.g., 3-5 years) and then update the [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuation]] as time progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. There are multiple options for valuing by multiples, including P/E, EV/EBITDA, Net Asset Value, and Cash Flow Multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (PER)

The P/E ratio is the most common method to [[the_importance_of_understanding_stock_valuation | value stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **Formula:** `Price / Earnings` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
    *   `Price`: The current share price or market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   `Earnings`: The company's annual net accounting profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Example (Inditex):**
    *   If Inditex is listed at 27 euros and earns approximately one euro per share annually, its P/E ratio is 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   This is considered a high P/E, as the average [[market_valuation_concerns_and_potential_stock_market_bubble | stock market]] trades around 15-16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The US market is around 18 times, while the European market is 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Interpretation:**
    *   A high P/E often indicates that investors expect significant [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | future growth]] in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For instance, if Inditex's earnings are expected to double to two euros per share in five years, its P/E would effectively be reduced to 13 times, making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Low P/E ratios can signal "[[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | value traps]]" where future earnings are expected to decline, making the actual price paid much higher relative to future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In such cases, the price may need to drop to adjust to a more realistic [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   For large-cap companies, a low P/E might suggest the market is anticipating future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.# Intrinsic Value in Stock Valuation

## Valuation by Multiples

Since the DCF method is not always reliable for practical purposes, [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | valuation by multiples]] is commonly used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This approach aims to predict what a business will earn in a more visible timeframe (e.g., 3-5 years) and then update the [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuation]] as time progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. There are multiple options for valuing by multiples, including P/E, EV/EBITDA, Net Asset Value, and Cash Flow Multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### 1. Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (PER)

The P/E ratio is the most common method to [[the_importance_of_understanding_stock_valuation | value stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

*   **Formula:** `Price / Earnings` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
    *   `Price`: The current share price or market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
    *   `Earnings`: The company's annual net accounting profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

*   **Example (Inditex):**
    *   If Inditex is listed at 27 euros and earns approximately one euro per share annually, its P/E ratio is 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.
    *   This is considered a high P/E, as the average [[market_valuation_concerns_and_potential_stock_market_bubble | stock market]] trades around 15-16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The US market is around 18 times, while the European market is 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

*   **Interpretation:**
    *   A high P/E often indicates that investors expect significant [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | future growth]] in earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. For instance, if Inditex's earnings are expected to double to two euros per share in five years, its P/E would effectively be reduced to 13 times, making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Low P/E ratios can signal "[[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | value traps]]" where future earnings are expected to decline, making the actual price paid much higher relative to future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. In such cases, the price may need to drop to adjust to a more realistic [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
    *   For large-cap companies, a low P/E might suggest the market is anticipating future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

*   **Industry Differences:**
    *   Different industries have different typical P/E ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
    *   Automotive companies or airlines may not trade above 8-10 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.
    *   High-quality companies often trade above 18-20 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   The P/E also factors in expected future [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | growth]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

*   **P/E and Returns:**
    *   Buying a company at a P/E of 10 can be equivalent to an annual return of 10% (or recovering the investment in 10 years), assuming profits do not change or grow, and all profits are paid out as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>.
    *   Buying a business at a P/E of 20 is equivalent to an annual return of 5%, assuming profits do not grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This is calculated as `1 / P/E * 100` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
    *   Studies suggest that buying at a low P/E has historically yielded higher returns (12-13%) compared to the market average (9-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This highlights why [[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | value investing]] works by constantly buying things for less than their market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

*   **Limitation:** The P/E ratio does not account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Companies with significant debt may appear to have low P/E ratios (e.g., 4-5 times) because the calculation only considers equity, overlooking the company's liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### 2. Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

This method incorporates debt and has shown good results, consistently yielding annual returns of 15% over the last 20 years for the cheapest companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It is considered more useful than simply buying low P/E companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

*   **Formula:** `(Market Capitalization + Financial Debt) / EBITDA` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>
    *   `Market Capitalization`: Number of shares multiplied by the listing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:55">[00:13:55]</a>.
    *   `Financial Debt`: Debt that incurs interest and can lead to bankruptcy (excludes trade payables, employee liabilities, etc.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
    *   `EBITDA`: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. It is a measure of profit that can be found in annual reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

*   **Benefits:** Unlike P/E, EV/EBITDA takes into account the company's capital structure, including its debt level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This provides a more comprehensive [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | valuation]] by valuing the entire business (assets) rather than just the equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

*   **Calculation Example:**
    *   If a company's EBITDA is 1.5 billion and you apply a multiple of 10 times, the total asset [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] is 15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
    *   If the company owes 3 billion in debt, subtracting this from the asset value yields an equity value of 12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.
    *   Dividing this equity value by the number of shares (e.g., 1 billion shares) gives a target share price (e.g., 12 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The aim is to buy shares at a discount (e.g., 5-7 euros) to this target price, incorporating a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

*   **Industry Differences:**
    *   Different industries trade at different EV/EBITDA multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>.
    *   Raw material extraction companies may trade at no more than six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
    *   Supermarkets might trade around nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.
    *   High-quality businesses like Inditex or consumer goods companies (Procter & Gamble, Unilever) are rarely found below 12-13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
    *   More mundane businesses might trade at 6-7 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

*   **Relative vs. Absolute Valuation:** EV/EBITDA is more effective for relative [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] (comparing similar companies, e.g., McDonald's vs. Burger King) rather than absolute [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | valuation]] based on arbitrary multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

### 3. Price-to-Book (P/B) Ratio (Price to Book Value)

This method compares the company's market price to its book value (net worth on the balance sheet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>. It is simple, as it involves checking the company's accounting books for its stated worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

*   **Example (Inditex):**
    *   Inditex's book value might be 10 billion, but it was listed on the stock market at 80 billion, representing a multiple of 8 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.
    *   This high multiple is common for businesses with significant intangible assets (like brands or reputation) that are not fully captured in accounting books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. For example, Coca-Cola or PayPal's value is largely based on brand trust and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
    *   In contrast, companies with primarily tangible assets, like a maritime transport company with ships, tend to list closer to their book value because there's less intangible value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>.
    *   Banks and mining companies, for instance, often trade at 1.5 to 2 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

*   **Application:** Calculate book value per share by dividing total book value by the number of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>.
*   **Safety Margin:** Buying a company for less than its book value can provide a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. However, it's crucial to assess the true quality and worth of the assets, as accounting rules may overstate their real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>.
*   **Usage:** While informative, it is not a very commonly used ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### 4. Net Asset Value (NAV)

This method is specific to companies that own other easily valued assets, particularly shares in other listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

*   **Process:** Sum the value of each individual asset, then divide by the number of shares to get the net asset value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
*   **Market Discount:** Companies valued by NAV typically trade below their calculated NAV, often at a 20% discount. This is because the market anticipates a price drop if the underlying shares had to be liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### 5. Sum of the Parts (SOTP)

Similar to NAV, but more sophisticated, SOTP is used for companies with diverse business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

*   **Process:** Instead of applying a single multiple to the entire company, different multiples are applied to each distinct business segment based on their quality and characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>. For example, a lower multiple for less attractive businesses and a higher multiple for high-[[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | growth]] or stable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
*   **Integration:** Each part's [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] can be done using P/E, P/B, or EV/EBITDA, typically based on the benefits each segment produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. The individual valuations are then summed up and divided by the number of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.

## Variations of Multiples

More specific variations of these methods exist:

*   **EV/EBITDAR:** This variation includes rent expenses (`R`) in the enterprise value, particularly for companies with high rental costs (e.g., airlines leasing planes). Rents are often treated as a form of debt and multiplied by a factor (e.g., 7 times) to account for their impact on [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.
*   **Price to Free Cash Flow:** Similar to P/E, this ratio uses free cash flow (a more refined net income figure that accounts for depreciation and capital investments) instead of earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. It is a valid method that yields good results, although it also does not account for a company's leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

These are the main methods for [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | stock valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. The next part will delve into a practical example to illustrate the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

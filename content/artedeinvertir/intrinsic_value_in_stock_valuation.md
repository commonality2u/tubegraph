Valuing a stock or an investment is one of the most important topics in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To succeed in finance and investment, an investor must try to pay less than what they believe an asset is worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The central question is how to accurately calculate an asset's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Understanding Intrinsic Value

[[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | Intrinsic value]], as academically defined, is a broad concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For a stock like Microsoft, there is a stock price line and an [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | intrinsic value]] line, which can be calculated using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The goal is to buy a stock when its market price is below its estimated [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. A larger difference between the two ideally leads to a greater return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

If the [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] is done well, the market will eventually recognize the true value within one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, many investors lack the patience to wait for this long-term horizon, which can hinder their returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Methods for Stock Valuation

### Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

The academic definition of [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | intrinsic value]] is based on **discounted cash flows (DCF)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This method involves discounting a company's projected earnings throughout its lifespan at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Investing is considered an art, not an exact science, because predicting a company's earnings 10 or 15 years into the future is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

A significant problem with the DCF method is that the profits from the next five years have a very small impact on the final [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, if a share trades at 30 euros, the next five years' profits might only account for 10-20% of that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. While considered a "scientific method" by academics, it often lacks practical applicability in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

The formula for DCF involves:
*   **Cash flow (CF)**: The cash flow produced by the company in a given period (e.g., Year 1, Year 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.
*   **Discount rate (r)**: An appropriate rate to discount future cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.
*   **Number of periods (n)**: The specific period (e.g., 1 for Year 1, 2 for Year 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>.

The further out in time the cash flows are, the less weight they have in the formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. The first 4-5 years often have a very small weight on the final result, which is where the problem lies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

### Valuation by Multiples

Since the DCF method is not always reliable, **[[evaluating_business_models_and_intrinsic_value | valuation by multiples]]** was developed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This approach involves predicting a business's earnings for 3-5 years, which is more visible, and then updating the [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

Common multiples include:
*   Price-to-Earnings (P/E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>
*   EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>
*   Net Asset Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>
*   Price to Cash Flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>

#### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio (PER)

The **P/E ratio**, often simply called "PER" or "the dog" in the transcript, is the most common method for valuing shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>.

**Formula**:
`P/E = Price (or Market Capitalization) / Earnings (or Net Accounting Profit)` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>

*   **Price/Market Capitalization**: The price per share or the total market capitalization (number of shares multiplied by the listing price) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Earnings**: What the company earns annually, specifically the net accounting profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

**Example: Inditex**
If Inditex is listed at 27 euros and is expected to earn approximately 1 euro per share this year, its P/E ratio is 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This is considered a high P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. The average stock market typically trades at 15-16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The current American market is around 18 times, while the European market is 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

A high P/E implies that investors expect future earnings to grow significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. If Inditex's earnings per share are expected to double to 2 euros in three to five years, its P/E would effectively reduce to 13 times, making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

Low P/E ratios can sometimes indicate "value traps" if future earnings are expected to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. For large-cap companies trading at a low P/E, the market might be discounting a future problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

**Industry Variations**:
Different industries have different typical P/E ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   Automotive companies or airlines may not trade at more than 8-10 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   High-quality companies are often listed above 18-20 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.
*   The P/E ratio also considers the future growth a company is expected to experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.

**P/E as a Return Indicator**:
Buying a company with a P/E of 10 might be seen as equivalent to a 10% annual return on investment or recovering the investment money in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. This holds true if the company's profits remain stable or grow, and if it distributes all its profits as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. If a business is bought at a P/E of 20, it corresponds to an approximate 5% annual return if profits do not grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

Historically, buying stocks with low P/E ratios (value investing) has produced an average return of 12-13%, compared to the market average of 9-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. This indicates that [[evaluating_longterm_stock_valuation_strategies | value investing]] works because it involves consistently buying assets for less than their listed price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

**Limitation**:
A key problem with the P/E ratio is that it does not account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Companies with high debt may trade at a low P/E (e.g., 4 or 5) due to the debt problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. The P/E only values the equity or net worth of the company, ignoring how much money the company owes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>. Other [[valuation metrics and considerations for stock investments | valuation metrics]] do consider the capital structure (how much the company owns, equity, and liabilities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

#### EV/EBITDA

**EV/EBITDA** (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) is another method of [[evaluating_business_models_and_intrinsic_value | valuation by multiples]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. This method has shown good results, with companies consistently buying the cheapest companies using this multiple achieving an annual return of 15% over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. This performance is even more useful than buying companies with low P/E ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

This ratio is more complex for beginners to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. It incorporates many factors, particularly the company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. While P/E only considers net profit, EV/EBITDA takes into account whether a company is highly leveraged or not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

**Formula**:
`EV/EBITDA = (Market Capitalization + Financial Debt) / EBITDA` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>

*   **Market Capitalization**: The total value of a company's outstanding shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Financial Debt**: Debt that accrues interest and can lead to bankruptcy; it does not include money owed to suppliers or employees (which is working capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>.
*   **EBITDA**: Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization. It's a measure of operational profitability that can be found in a company's financial reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.

When valuing with EV/EBITDA, it's recommended to work in terms of the entire business's value, then divide by the number of shares to get the target price per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

**Example Calculation**:
1.  Assume a company's EBITDA is 1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.
2.  Apply a multiple, e.g., 10 times, to the EBITDA. This gives an asset [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] of 15 billion (1.5 billion * 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
3.  Subtract the company's debt from this asset value. If the company owes 3 billion, then the equity (what shareholders buy) is 12 billion (15 billion - 3 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>.
4.  To get the price per share, divide the equity value by the number of shares in circulation. If there is 1 billion shares, the target [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] is 12 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

Investors aim to buy shares below this target value (e.g., at 5-7 euros) to incorporate a margin of safety due to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.

**Limitations**:
EV/EBITDA is not ideal for absolute [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] because EBITDA is calculated before depreciation, interest, and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>. To get net profit from EBITDA, one must subtract depreciation, interest, and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

Depreciation varies significantly between industries:
*   Businesses requiring little capital (e.g., supermarkets) have higher net profits after depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:41">[00:18:41]</a>.
*   Capital-intensive businesses (e.g., construction companies with cranes, trucks) see their net profits significantly reduced by depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:45">[00:18:45]</a>.
Therefore, different industries trade at different EV/EBITDA multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>:
*   Raw materials extraction companies: usually not more than 6 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:58">[00:18:58]</a>.
*   Supermarket chains: around 9 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   Great businesses like Inditex or consumer goods companies (Procter & Gamble, Unilever): often 12-15 times or more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
*   More "mundane" businesses: 6-7 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

EV/EBITDA is best used for **relative [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]]**, comparing similar companies, rather than making an absolute [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] based on arbitrary criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>. For example, if McDonald's is listed at 15 times earnings, and Burger King is similar but can be bought at 10 times, they should eventually converge in [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

#### Price to Book Value (P/B)

The **Price to Book Value (P/B)** ratio compares a company's market price to its book value (net assets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>. Book value represents the value of assets minus liabilities, reflecting the equity portion that investors buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

It is a simple method that involves checking the company's books for its stated worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:19:58]</a>.

**Example: Inditex**
Inditex's book value might be around 10 billion, but it was listed on the stock market at 80 billion, resulting in a P/B multiple of almost 8 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>. This "astronomical" multiple occurs because the better a business is, and the more its competitive advantage is based on intangible assets (like a brand), the higher its P/B multiple will be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

**Intangible Assets**:
Companies like Coca-Cola or Pepsi, whose businesses are based on reputation, consumer trust, and beloved products, have significant intangible value not fully reflected in their books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.
In contrast, companies like maritime transport businesses, which own tangible assets like ships, are valued more on what they physically own rather than their potential for future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>. These companies typically have much lower P/B values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>.

**Industry Examples**:
*   Mining companies or banks typically list at 1.5-2 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:35">[00:21:35]</a>. An exceptional bank might list at 3-4 times in a moment of euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.

To calculate P/B per share, take the total book value, divide it by the number of shares, to get the book value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.

**Limitation**:
Different industries require different P/B ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:21:58]</a>. While buying a company for less than its book value can provide a margin of safety, investors must understand the true quality of the underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>. Accounting rules may value assets at a certain amount on the balance sheet, but their real value could be less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Despite its simplicity, P/B is not a very commonly used ratio for [[evaluating_business_models and intrinsic_value | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>.

#### Net Asset Value (NAV)

**Net Asset Value (NAV)** is a method used when a company owns other assets that are easily valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.

**Example**:
Alba Financial Corporation in Spain, which owns shares in other listed companies like Red Eléctrica or Telefónica <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>.
The method is simple: sum the value of each part (e.g., the market value of the shares it owns), divide by the total number of the company's shares to get the NAV per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:23">[00:23:23]</a>.
A company valued by NAV will almost always be listed below its calculated NAV, often at a 20% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>. This is because the market anticipates that liquidating those underlying shares would push their prices down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>.

#### Sum of the Parts (SOTP)

The **Sum of the Parts (SOTP)** method is similar to NAV but more sophisticated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>. It is used for companies that have different lines of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

If a company has both very good businesses and more typical businesses, a single multiple cannot be applied to the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. Instead:
1.  Apply a lower multiple to the "bad" or less profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
2.  Apply a higher multiple to the "good" business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
3.  Sum the individual valuations of each part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
4.  Divide by the total number of shares to arrive at the SOTP [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
This individual [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] can be done using P/E, P/B, or EV/EBITDA, but typically involves a multiple defined by the expected benefits from each business segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:52">[00:24:52]</a>.

### Variations of Valuation Methods

There are variations of the discussed methods:
*   **EV/EBIT** (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes): Subtracts depreciation from EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:19">[00:25:19]</a>.
*   **EV/EBITDAR** (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent/Restructuring): Accounts for companies that pay high rents, such as those leasing airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. Rents are added to the EV, often multiplied by a factor (e.g., 7) as a proxy for debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. This is considered more advanced material <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:09">[00:26:09]</a>.
*   **Price/Free Cash Flow**: A variation of the P/E ratio, where net income is refined to account for depreciation relative to capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. It does not consider debt or leverage, focusing only on net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:51">[00:26:51]</a>.

These are the main [[valuation metrics and considerations for stock investments | valuation metrics]] and methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. This article has covered the theoretical aspects of [[valuation and stock market trends | stock valuation]], with a future video planning to provide a practical example of how to use this information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

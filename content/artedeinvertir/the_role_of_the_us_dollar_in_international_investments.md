Staly Druen Miller, a highly successful investor with 100% positive returns in his stock market operations, is preparing for a new economic and stock market scenario in 2025 by repositioning his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. His investment strategies reflect an anticipation of a weakening US dollar and its impact on various sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>.

## Druckenmiller's Outlook on the Dollar

One of Miller's key premises for the next 12-24 months and 2025 is that the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | US dollar will decrease in value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>. This expectation stems from the "enormous printing of money" and the ongoing issue of the fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>. He also anticipates that inflation will remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:42:00">[07:42:00]</a>. The dollar has already started to weaken, dropping between 5% and 6% in value recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Miller states, "we have printed more than 8 trillion dollars, I can't be bullish on the dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. His current investments are designed to [[investment_strategies_to_hedge_against_dollar_depreciation | benefit from this projected drop in the dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## Impact on International Stocks

When the dollar weakens, [[international_stock_investments_for_currency_diversification | international stocks]] from regions like Europe, Japan, and emerging countries tend to perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>. Specifically, [[impact_of_dollar_decline_on_global_economy | emerging countries]] benefit because a significant portion of their debt is denominated in dollars, and a depreciating dollar relieves pressure on their accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This is a primary reason for Miller's substantial investments outside the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

## Impact on Commodities and US Exports

Within the United States, Miller is investing in sectors related to commodities and industrial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. These sectors tend to perform well when the dollar depreciates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>. For US industrial companies that export, a depreciating dollar increases their profits when they repatriate earnings made abroad in stronger currencies, leading to stock market appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:11:00">[09:11:00]</a>.

There is generally a negative correlation between the dollar's value and commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. When the dollar rises, commodity values tend to fall, and vice versa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>. This correlation is most evident in gold and silver, but also applies to aluminum, sugar, and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Oil, for example, is expected to rise if the dollar's value falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>.

### Example: Kinder Morgan (Oil and Gas Pipeline)

Kinder Morgan, a leading oil and gas pipeline company in the US, is a significant investment for Miller due to its bullish vision on oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>. Oil tends to rise with inflation and performs well when the dollar's value falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:47:00">[10:47:00]</a>. The company also benefits from the weak dollar because oil and gas are traded in dollars; as the dollar's value drops, the price of each unit of gas per dollar rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:27:00">[13:27:00]</a>.

## Dollar's Influence on Real Estate Investments

A weak dollar and inflation are considered positive for real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>. Real estate is viewed as one of the best assets to protect against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:51:00">[25:51:00]</a>. If the dollar decreases in value, the value of property in dollars should increase, as properties are tangible assets unlike the unbacked dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:01:00">[26:01:00]</a>.

### Example: American Apartments (Real Estate Investment Trust)

American Apartments, a real estate investment company, is another interesting investment due to its focus on luxury apartments in demographically strong US states like Texas, Florida, and Atlanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:00:00">[24:00:00]</a>. The weak dollar and inflation act as a positive factor for this real estate investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:47:00">[25:47:00]</a>.

Miller's investment strategy highlights how a forecasted [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | decline of the US dollar as world reserve currency]] can influence portfolio allocation, shifting towards international stocks, commodities, US industrial exporters, and real estate assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:33:00">[08:33:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:48:00">[25:48:00]</a>. This approach aims to [[strategies_to_protect_savings_from_dollar_devaluation | protect savings from dollar devaluation]] and capitalize on market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

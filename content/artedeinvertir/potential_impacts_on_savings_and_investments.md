The 2030 Agenda, a significant economic and social reform, is anticipated to have serious implications for personal savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This plan, supported by global figures like Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, and the United Nations, is already underway and its initial consequences are being felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Some believe the policies proposed within this economic plan could be contributing to the current economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## What is the 2030 Agenda?

This economic plan, also known by names such as "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world," originated from the Davos Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>. Designed in 2015, its implementation began seven years ago, and it is now entering its most critical phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. Many experts and economists suggest that these policies could be a cause of the current crisis, particularly due to high levels of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>.

The overarching motto of this global campaign is "you will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. Klaus Schwab, head of the Davos Forum (World Economic Forum), is a key figure leading these policies to modify the new economic and social reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. Ida Auken, a Danish politician, summarized the economic part of this agenda by stating: "Welcome to 2030. I have nothing, I have no privacy, and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. The World Economic Forum's promotional video, "Eight Predictions for the World in the Year 2030," contains key insights into these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.

## Key Economic Shifts and Their Impact on Investments

The 2030 Agenda seeks to completely modify the way individuals invest and save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

### 1. Shift from Ownership to Rental/Subscription Models

One of the biggest economic changes being implemented is a shift from owning things to renting them or paying long-term subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This change is proving tremendously beneficial for a small number of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>, encouraging greater consumption and translating into increased business profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>.

Examples of this trend include:
*   **Cars**: In the US, 70% of vehicles sold are financed, often through long-term rentals or monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>.
*   **Technology**: Most people rent their iPhones from Apple for a monthly fee rather than owning them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. Similarly, movies are consumed via monthly subscriptions to services like Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>.
*   **Software**: Companies like Microsoft and Adobe have shifted from selling perpetual licenses to charging monthly or annual rental fees for their products (e.g., Microsoft Office, Adobe Photoshop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. While initially seeming cheaper, this model extracts significantly more money from consumers over their lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:28:00">[08:28:00]</a>.
*   **Automotive Features**: BMW's initiative to charge monthly fees for features like heated seats or artificial sports sounds indicates the extent of this rental obsession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>.

This shift, often aligned with the 2030 Agenda, is seen as legitimate despite potentially monopolistic practices that would have been penalized in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>.

### 2. Decline of the US Dollar and Rise of Asian Currencies

A significant prediction suggests that the United States will no longer be the world's leading power, with other countries replacing it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Ray Dalio has warned about this risk, suggesting the dollar could cease to be the most important currency, leading to a decline for the US due to debt accumulation and political populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. The dollar's market share has already fallen from 70% to 60%, being replaced by other currencies, particularly the Chinese Yuan and other Asian currencies where growth is currently being generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

### 3. Energy Transition and [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | Inflation]]

Predictions 5 and 6 of the World Economic Forum's agenda, focused on environmental protection, propose radical measures like completely eliminating fossil fuels without a clear strategic energy transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:47:00">[09:47:00]</a>. This includes measures such as establishing price limits on gas or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

This approach is seen as a major cause of the current terrible [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] crisis, largely driven by high prices of fossil fuels like oil and gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:10:00]</a>. [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | High and rising inflation]] is considered the most detrimental economic factor for the average person, historically causing increased poverty and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:00">[10:17:00]</a>.

A "battle against fossil fuels," coinciding with the 2030 Agenda's implementation, has led to a lack of investment in the sector. Investment in oil exploitation and production has fallen by 60%, from $600 billion annually to less than $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. This has resulted in high energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

Despite these challenges, it's possible to [[how_to_protect_investments_during_economic_changes | protect investments during economic changes]] or even benefit from the new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:00">[00:53:00]</a>.

### Benefiting from the "Rental" Model

Companies that have adopted or are benefiting from the subscription/rental model have seen significant growth:
*   **Microsoft (MSFT)**: After changing its model in 2013 from selling perpetual licenses to charging monthly rents, its shares multiplied by more than ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:00">[07:41:00]</a>.
*   **Adobe (ADBE)**: Similarly, since changing its economic model in 2012 to a monthly license fee, its stock has multiplied by over 12 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>. Its valuation has also dropped, making it potentially more attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.
*   **Automotive Financial Divisions**: The financial divisions of car companies like Volkswagen and Renault are often more lucrative than the manufacturing business itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>.

Many companies benefiting from rental payments or monthly subscriptions have seen their valuations drop drastically in the first six months of 2022, potentially presenting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:00">[14:21:00]</a>.

### Investing in Energy Amidst [[inflation_impact_on_investment_portfolios | Inflation Impact on Investment Portfolios]]

Given the high energy prices, oil and gas companies have been strong investments in 2022 while much of the market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>. Savvy investors like Warren Buffett anticipated this trend, aggressively investing in the sector months before oil prices soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>.

*   **Occidental Oil (OXY)**: Warren Buffett invested over $10 billion in this leading oil extraction and processing company, which has low extraction costs and large reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>. It is currently trading at six times earnings, below its historical average of ten times earnings, and has a strong program of returning profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:55:00">[11:55:00]</a>.

Understanding these economic shifts and their implications is crucial for navigating the investment landscape in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:38:00">[14:38:00]</a>.

To succeed in finance and investment, one must aim to pay less than what an asset is perceived to be worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. The challenge lies in accurately calculating an asset's true worth, known academically as [[Intrinsic value in stock valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. For a stock like Microsoft, an image illustrates how the stock price (red line) can fluctuate around its calculated [[Intrinsic value in stock valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. The goal is to purchase a stock when its price is below its estimated [[Intrinsic value in stock valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. A larger difference between price and estimated value generally leads to a greater potential return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. With proper [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation]], the market tends to correct itself within one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Academic Valuation: Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)

The academic definition of [[Intrinsic value in stock valuation | intrinsic value]] often refers to discounted cash flows (DCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. This method involves discounting a company's projected future earnings over its lifetime at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. However, since investing is an art, not a precise science, predicting a company's earnings 10 to 15 years out is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

A significant problem with the DCF method is that the profits from the first five years have a very small impact on the final [[Asset valuation and intrinsic value | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For instance, the next five years of profit might only influence a 30-euro share price by 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The formula for DCF involves:
*   Cash flow (CF) the company produces in a given period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   'R' representing the discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   'N' representing the number of periods, where cash flows further in the future have less weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

Despite this, the first four or five years of cash flows still have a very small weight on the final result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Due to the unreliability of this method for practical purposes, [[Valuation by multiples | valuation by multiples]] became a common alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Valuation by Multiples

[[Valuation by multiples | Valuation by multiples]] involves predicting a business's earnings over a shorter, more visible period (e.g., 3-5 years) and then updating the [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation]] as time progresses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. There are several options for valuing by multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The most common method for valuing shares is the P/E ratio, or Price Earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

The P/E ratio formula is:
$$ \frac{\text{Price or Market Capitalization}}{\text{Annual Net Accounting Profit (Earnings)}} $$
Market capitalization can be calculated as the number of shares multiplied by the listing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The numerator can also be the price per share, with the denominator being the earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

**Example: Inditex**
Inditex, listed at 27 euros, is estimated to earn approximately one euro per share annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This results in a P/E of 27 times, which is considered high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. The average stock market P/E is typically 15-16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>, with the American market around 18 times and the European market at 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

A high P/E often indicates that investors anticipate significant future earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. If Inditex's earnings per share were projected to double to two euros in three to five years, its P/E would reduce to 13 times, making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.

Conversely, a low P/E can signal a "value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. If future earnings are expected to decline (e.g., from one euro to 0.7 or 0.5 euros), the true effective P/E could be much higher (e.g., 50 times instead of 27), prompting the stock price to drop for a more realistic [[Valuation of stocks and market dynamics | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. For large-cap companies trading at a low P/E, the market might be factoring in a future problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Different industries require different P/E multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, automotive or airline companies rarely trade above 8-10 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, while high-quality companies typically trade above 18-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The P/E ratio also considers a company's future growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

A P/E of 10 can be interpreted as a 10% return on investment or recovering the investment money in 10 years, assuming stable or growing profits that are fully paid out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. A P/E of 20 equates to a 5% annual return if profits do not grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This is calculated by taking the inverse (1/P/E) and multiplying by 100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Buying at a low P/E has historically yielded better returns than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. Value investing works because it involves consistently buying assets for less than their listed value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

A limitation of the P/E ratio is that it does not account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Companies with high debt might appear to have a low P/E (e.g., 4-5 times) because the P/E only considers equity, overlooking the company's liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Enterprise Value to EBITA (EV/EBITA)

The EV/EBITA method is a multiple that has shown good results for [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Consistently buying companies with the lowest EV/EBITA multiples has yielded an annual return of 15% over 20 years, outperforming the general market return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. This ratio is more complex than P/E because it incorporates many factors, especially the company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. Unlike P/E, EV/EBITA considers whether a company is highly leveraged to generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a>.

EV/EBITA is useful for comparable [[Valuation of stocks and market dynamics | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. If a similar company (e.g., McDonald's) is trading at 15 times earnings, and another (e.g., Burger King) can be bought at 10 times, they should eventually converge in [[Valuation of stocks and market dynamics | valuation]] due to their similar nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

The EV/EBITA formula is:
$$ \frac{\text{Market Capitalization + Financial Debt}}{\text{EBITA}} $$
Financial debt refers to interest-bearing debt, not operational liabilities like money owed to suppliers or employees (which is working capital) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. In advanced calculations, minority interests might also be added to the numerator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

This method allows for valuing the entire asset side of a company's balance sheet (equity plus debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. To arrive at the equity value, debt is subtracted from the total asset value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. The EBITA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization) can be found in a company's financial reports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

**Example:**
If a company's EBITA is 1.5 billion, and it's valued at 10 times EBITA, the total asset [[Asset valuation and intrinsic value | valuation]] would be 15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. If the company owes 3 billion in debt, subtracting this from the asset value yields an equity value of 12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Dividing this by the number of shares (e.g., 1 billion shares) gives a target price per share of 12 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. The aim would be to buy shares when they are significantly lower (e.g., 5-7 euros) to ensure a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

EBITA represents profits before depreciation, interest, and taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. To get to net profit, depreciation, interest, and taxes must be subtracted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. The impact of depreciation varies by industry; capital-intensive businesses (e.g., construction) will see a greater reduction in profit after accounting for depreciation compared to less capital-intensive ones (e.g., supermarkets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Different industries trade at different EV/EBITA multiples:
*   Raw material extraction companies: often not more than 6 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.
*   Supermarket divisions: around 9 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
*   Great businesses like Inditex or consumer goods companies (Procter & Gamble, Unilever): often 12-15 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
*   More mundane businesses: typically 6-7 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

EV/EBITA works better as a relative [[Valuation of stocks and market dynamics | valuation]] tool rather than for making absolute [[Valuation of stocks and market dynamics | valuation]] decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### Price-to-Book Value

The Price-to-Book (P/B) value, or Price to Book Value, is another [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation]] concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. It's a simple method that compares the market price to the company's book value (equity) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:52">[00:19:52]</a>.

**Example: Inditex**
Inditex had a book value of approximately 10 billion, but its market listing was 80 trillion, resulting in a P/B multiple of 8 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. This high multiple is often seen in businesses whose competitive advantage is based on intangible assets like brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, PayPal) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. These intangibles are not fully valued in the company's books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:48]</a>.

Conversely, companies with tangible assets that are transactional (e.g., a maritime transport company with ships) usually list closer to their book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Banks or mining companies, for example, might trade at 1.5 to 2 times book value, or up to 3-4 times in moments of euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

To calculate P/B per share, take the total book value, divide it by the number of shares, and then compare it to the share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:45">[00:21:45]</a>. Buying below book value usually provides a margin of safety, but it's crucial to understand the quality and real value of the assets, as accounting rules might overstate their true worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. This ratio is not as commonly used as P/E or EV/EBITA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### Net Asset Value (NAV)

The Net Asset Value (NAV) method is suitable for companies that own easily valued assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. For instance, a financial corporation that primarily holds shares in other listed companies can be valued by adding up the market value of each of those parts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.

The method is simple:
1.  Sum the value of each individual asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
2.  Divide the total by the number of shares to get the NAV per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>.

A company's stock price will typically trade below its NAV, often at a 20% discount, because the market accounts for the potential price impact if those assets were to be liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

### Sum of the Parts

The Sum of the Parts [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation]] method is a more sophisticated approach similar to NAV but applied when a company has different lines of business that cannot be valued with a single multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>.

This method involves:
1.  Taking each distinct business segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.
2.  Applying a specific multiple (e.g., lower for "bad" businesses, higher for "good" businesses) to each part based on its earnings potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
3.  Summing these individual valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:34">[00:24:34]</a>.
4.  Dividing by the total number of shares to get the overall company [[Valuation and growth potential of companies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>.
This individual [[Valuation and performance of specific stocks and sectors | valuation]] of each part can use P/E, P/B, or EV/EBITA multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

### Other Variations of Multiples

*   **EV/EBITDA:** This is a variation of EV/EBITA where amortization is subtracted from EBITA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a>.
*   **EV/EBITDAR:** This accounts for companies with high rent expenses (e.g., leasing airplanes) by including those rents in the denominator, treating them similarly to debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. A quick rule of thumb is to multiply rents by 7 and add them to the market cap and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:53">[00:25:53]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Free Cash Flow (P/FCF):** Similar to P/E, this ratio uses free cash flow (a more refined net income figure that accounts for depreciation relative to investment) instead of net income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:14">[00:26:14]</a>. Like P/E, it does not directly account for a company's debt or leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

These are the main methods for [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | valuation]] by multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. A practical example of how to apply these methods and find the necessary information will be covered in future discussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:09">[00:27:09]</a>.

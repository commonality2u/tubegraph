Understanding how to [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | value a stock]] or an investment is one of the most important topics in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. To be successful in investing, one must aim to pay less than an asset's perceived worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The academic concept of [[evaluating_business_models_and_intrinsic_value | intrinsic value]] is broad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Ideally, an investor should purchase a stock when its price is below its estimated [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | intrinsic value]], with a larger difference potentially leading to greater returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. If valuation is done correctly, the market tends to reflect the true value within one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF)

The academic definition of [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | intrinsic value]] relies on discounted cash flows (DCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. This method involves discounting a company's projected lifetime earnings at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, investing is considered an art, not an exact science <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, making it difficult to accurately predict a company's earnings 10 to 15 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

A significant problem with DCF is that the first five years of a company's profits have a very small impact on the final valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. For example, if a share trades at 30 euros, the first five years might only influence 10-20% of that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. This makes DCF more of a scientific method that lacks practical application in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. The formula for DCF discounts future cash flows (CF) by a discount rate (r) over periods (n), reducing the weight of cash flows further out in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

## Valuation by Multiples

Given the unreliability of the DCF method, [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation by multiples]] emerged as an alternative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This approach aims to predict a business's earnings within a more visible 3 to 5-year horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, with valuations updated over time based on how the price evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. There are several common [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation metrics]] used in this method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

### Price-to-Earnings Ratio (P/E or PER)

The Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio is one of the most common methods for valuing shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

> [!example] P/E Formula
> P/E = Price (or Market Capitalization) / Earnings (Net Accounting Profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>

Market capitalization can be calculated as the number of shares multiplied by the listing price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. It is recommended to work with the valuation of the entire business rather than per share initially, then divide the final valuation by the number of shares to get a target price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

> [!example] Inditex P/E Example
> If Inditex is listed at 27 euros and earns approximately 1 euro per share annually, its P/E ratio is 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This is considered a high P/E, as the average stock market P/E is around 15-16 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a> (e.g., U.S. market around 18 times, European market 13-14 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
>
> A high P/E implies that investors expect earnings to grow significantly in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. If Inditex's earnings per share were expected to double to 2 euros in three years, the P/E would effectively reduce to 13 times, making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

> [!warning] Value Traps
> Conversely, a low P/E could indicate a "value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. If earnings are expected to decline in the future (e.g., from 1 euro to 0.7 or 0.5 euros), the effective P/E being paid is much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. In such cases, the stock price would tend to decrease to adjust to a more realistic valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For large-cap companies trading at a low P/E, the market is often discounting some future problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

Different industries have different P/E expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For instance, automotive companies or airlines may rarely trade above 8-10 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, while high-quality companies typically trade above 18-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The P/E ratio also incorporates expectations for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

> [!info] P/E as Annual Return
> Buying a company with a P/E of 10 is often equated to an annual return of 10% or recovering your investment in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. This is true if the company's profits remain stable and all profits are paid out as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. Similarly, a P/E of 20 implies an annual return of 5% if profits do not grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This inverse calculation (1/P/E * 100%) provides the implied annual performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
>
> Historically, buying low P/E stocks has produced an average return of 12-13% over the years, compared to the market average of 9-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This demonstrates why value investing works by consistently purchasing assets for less than their market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

A key limitation of the P/E ratio is that it does not account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Companies with significant debt may appear to have low P/E ratios (e.g., 4 or 5) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. P/E only values the equity or net worth of the company, neglecting its liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Other methods, however, consider the entire capital structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

### Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA)

EV/EBITDA is another [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation multiple]] that has shown good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. It is often considered more useful than P/E because it incorporates the company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. Consistent buying of companies with low EV/EBITDA multiples has historically yielded an annual return of 15% over the past 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

> [!example] EV/EBITDA Formula
> EV/EBITDA = (Market Capitalization + Financial Debt - Cash) / EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>
>
> *   **Market Capitalization (Market Cap)**: The total value of a company's outstanding shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:09">[00:13:09]</a>.
> *   **Financial Debt**: Debt that accrues interest and can lead to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. This does not include liabilities to suppliers or employees, which are part of working capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>.
> *   **EBITDA**: Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. It is a form of profit that excludes many non-operating expenses and non-cash charges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>.

This method arrives at the value of all assets by applying a multiple to EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. To determine the equity value (what is bought on the stock market), the debt is subtracted from the total asset valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>. EBITDA figures are generally easy to find in a company's annual reports or financial data pages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>.

> [!example] EV/EBITDA Valuation Calculation
> 1.  **Estimate EBITDA**: Suppose a company is expected to earn 1.5 billion in EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>.
> 2.  **Apply Multiple**: If you apply a multiple of 10 times (e.g., because it's a good business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>, the total asset valuation is 15 billion (1.5 billion * 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.
> 3.  **Subtract Debt**: If the company owes 3 billion in debt, subtract this from the asset valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. The equity value is 12 billion (15 billion - 3 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>.
> 4.  **Calculate Price per Share**: Divide the equity value by the number of shares in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>. If there are 1 billion shares, the target valuation is 12 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.
> 5.  **Apply Margin of Safety**: An investor would then seek to buy shares at a lower price (e.g., 5-7 euros) to account for uncertainty and create a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

> [!warning] EBITDA Limitations & Industry Variation
> EBITDA doesn't account for depreciation, interest, and taxes, which are subtracted to arrive at net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>. Businesses with high capital expenditure (e.g., construction companies) will have larger depreciation values, leading to lower net profits from the same EBITDA compared to less capital-intensive businesses (e.g., supermarkets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.
>
> Consequently, different industries trade at different EV/EBITDA multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>:
> *   Raw materials extraction: Typically not more than 6 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.
> *   Supermarkets: Around 9 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:59">[00:18:59]</a>.
> *   Great businesses like Inditex or consumer goods companies (Procter & Gamble, Unilever): Often 12-15 times or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:04">[00:19:04]</a>.
>
> EV/EBITDA is better suited for [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | relative valuation]] (comparing similar companies) rather than absolute valuation based on subjective criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:21">[00:19:21]</a>.

### Price to Book Value (P/B)

The Price to Book Value (P/B) ratio is another [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation metric]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. It measures a company's market value relative to its book value (net assets) as stated in its financial statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

> [!example] P/B Calculation
> 1.  Find the company's book value from its accounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>.
> 2.  Divide the total book value by the number of shares to get the book value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>.
> 3.  P/B = Share Price / Book Value per Share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:38">[00:19:38]</a>

> [!example] P/B and Intangible Assets
> For companies like Inditex, which might have a book value of 10 billion but a market listing of 80 trillion, the P/B ratio can be astronomical (e.g., 8 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>. This happens when a business's competitive advantage is based on intangible assets like brands or reputation, which are not fully valued in the books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. Companies like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble, built on customer trust and long-term consumption, will also have high P/B multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.
>
> Conversely, companies with more tangible assets like maritime transport companies (ships) or banks typically trade at much lower P/B values (e.g., 1.5 to 2 times, sometimes 3-4 times in euphoria) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. These businesses are valued more on their physical assets than on their profit-generating potential from those assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

Different industries require different P/B multiples, a skill gained through experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>. While buying a company for less than its book value can provide a margin of safety <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>, it's crucial to understand the true quality and value of the underlying assets, as accounting rules might overstate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a>. This ratio is not as commonly used as P/E or EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

### Net Asset Value (NAV)

Net Asset Value (NAV) is a method used when a company owns other easily valued assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>.

> [!example] NAV Example
> Financial Corporation Alba in Spain owns shares in other listed companies like Red Eléctrica or Viscofan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:57">[00:22:57]</a>.
>
> The method is straightforward: add up the value of each individual asset, then divide the total by the number of shares to get the net asset value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:14">[00:23:14]</a>.
>
> Typically, a company will trade below its NAV, often at a 20% discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:25]</a>. This discount accounts for the market's expectation that liquidating those assets would depress their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:34">[00:23:34]</a>.

### Sum of the Parts (SOTP)

The "Sum of the Parts" (SOTP) method is similar to NAV but is applied to companies with different lines of business that cannot be valued with a single multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>.

> [!info] SOTP Method
> If a company has both very good and more normal businesses, a different multiple is applied to each segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>. A lower multiple is used for less attractive businesses, and a higher multiple for good businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>. The individual valuations of each part are summed up, and then divided by the number of shares to arrive at the total SOTP valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:37">[00:24:37]</a>. This individual valuation can be done using P/E, P/B, or EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

### Variations of Multiples

There are several variations of the discussed [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation metrics]]:

*   **EV/EBIT (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest and Taxes)**: Similar to EV/EBITDA, but subtracts depreciation and amortization from EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **EV/EBITDAR (Enterprise Value to Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, Amortization, and Rent)**: Used for companies with high rent expenses (e.g., leasing airplanes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:27">[00:25:27]</a>. Rents are added to the denominator, often multiplied by a factor like 7, and treated similarly to debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>.
*   **Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF)**: A variation of P/E that uses free cash flow (a more refined net income figure that accounts for depreciation and capital investments) in the denominator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Like P/E, it looks at net profit without considering leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

These are the main [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation methods]] for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>.

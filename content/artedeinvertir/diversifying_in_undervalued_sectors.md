Staly Druen Miller, recognized as one of the best investors of all time, consistently achieves positive returns, demonstrating a knack for anticipating market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. His investment approach combines macroeconomic analysis with stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. For 2025, Miller is repositioning his portfolio, abandoning sectors where he foresees problems and shifting towards [[investment_strategies_in_small_caps_and_favorable_market_segments | attractively valued sectors]] he believes will perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This strategy involves a "great rotation," moving away from large, more technological companies to other, often forgotten, sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Key Premises for 2025

Miller operates on several key premises for the next 12 months and into 2025:
*   **Euphoria in certain sectors:** He observes euphoria in specific stock market sectors, particularly those related to Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Fed rate cuts:** He anticipates the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates due to a weakening economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Dollar devaluation:** Miller believes the dollar will decrease in value due to extensive money printing and fiscal deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Persistent high inflation:** Inflation is expected to remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Exiting Overvalued Sectors

Miller is actively selling shares in sectors he believes are overvalued and face potential problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. He has significantly reduced positions in major tech stocks:
*   **Nvidia:** He cut his position by 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, despite being an early investor who multiplied his money several times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. He feels there is excessive euphoria around AI companies, which he identifies as a danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Microsoft:** He reduced his position by 63%, selling over 700,000 shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

He notes that stock market bubbles are often characterized by an increase in fraud, as companies may distort accounts to meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Investments in Undervalued Sectors

Miller is [[importance_of_portfolio_diversification | diversifying]] into sectors and companies that are "more undervalued" and less connected to Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>. These investments align with his macroeconomic outlook.

### 1. Kinder Morgan (Oil & Gas Pipelines)
Kinder Morgan is a leading oil and gas pipeline company in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Miller's investment reflects a bullish view on oil, anticipating a rise with inflation, a falling dollar, and Fed rate cuts stimulating the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

*   **Market Position:** New permits for transportation lines are limited due to environmental policies, giving existing companies like Kinder Morgan a strong competitive position, potentially leading to increased transportation prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **Industry Trends:** Natural gas consumption is increasing significantly due to its low pollution and cost-effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. The U.S. is producing a surplus of gas, leading to increased exports, particularly to Europe, which benefits pipeline companies transporting gas to the coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. The International Energy Agency has warned about potential gas price problems if more pipelines aren't built <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
*   **Financials:** Kinder Morgan has doubled its profits per share and reduced leverage, while consistently returning capital to shareholders through dividends (currently around 6%) and buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. The stock is trading at 10 times its distributable cash flow, significantly below its historical average of 15-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.

### 2. American Apartments (Real Estate)
This Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) focuses on luxury apartments in states with favorable demographics and population growth, such as Texas, Florida, and Atlanta <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

*   **Valuation & Dividend:** The stock has fallen 30% from its peak and offers a high dividend payout <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Interest Rate Sensitivity:** A drop in interest rates significantly benefits real estate companies by lowering interest payments, increasing property values, and making dividend stocks more attractive compared to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>.
*   **Inflation & Dollar Hedging:** Real estate assets are strong protectors against inflation and benefit from a weak dollar, as property values in dollars should increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>.
*   **Supply/Demand:** Housing supply is limited in their target states, while demand is rising due to population migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.
*   **Financial Health:** The company has very low leverage (28% of total assets financed) and most of its debt is at a fixed, low rate (3.6%), providing stability and room for acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:16">[00:27:16]</a>.
*   **Outlook:** While 2024 profits might see a slight dip due to past rate hikes, the company expects to return to solid growth from 2025 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>. It's currently trading at 13 times earnings, below the sector's usual 16-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:33">[00:28:33]</a>.

### 3. Woodward (Aviation & Industrial Parts)
Woodward manufactures highly specific components for aviation (e.g., control sticks, pedals, sensors, fuel management systems) and also has an industrial segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>.

*   **Defensive Business:** It's a very defensive stock, with results remaining flat even during the 2008 crisis, only significantly impacted by COVID-19 lockdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:43">[00:30:43]</a>.
*   **Growth Drivers:** Aviation demand is strong post-COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. Woodward's components are increasingly integrated into new aircraft models, leading to higher spending per plane <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>. The company anticipates 12% growth in its aviation line, outpacing the general market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>.
*   **Outlook:** Woodward expects to double in size from 2023 to 2026, with an impressive earnings per share growth of 14-18% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. This growth rate is potentially higher than that of large tech companies like Microsoft or Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** While trading at 28 times earnings, it's considered cheaper than alternatives in other sectors with lower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:52">[00:32:52]</a>.

### 4. Coherent (Highly Specialized Industrial Components)
Coherent is Miller's largest current investment, valued at $260 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:11">[00:33:11]</a>. It manufactures industrial components like measuring lasers, thermal imaging, and other niche market applications, enabling high profit margins and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.

*   **Growth Potential:** The company projects high growth in its served sectors: 8% in electronics, 20% in telecommunications, and 14% in industrial, leading to an overall expected growth of over 14-15% until 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>.
*   **Miller's Philosophy in Action:** Miller emphasizes that the present doesn't drive stock prices; the future does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:37">[00:34:37]</a>. Coherent's current earnings per share have dropped, but this is attributed to companies delaying investment in fixed assets due to economic fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>. Miller sees this as an opportune moment, akin to buying chemical stocks when they are losing money and capacity has been reduced, anticipating future margin increases and stock appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Industrial Sector Recovery:** The US manufacturing index, currently showing contraction, is expected to rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:21">[00:38:21]</a>. This recovery, accelerated by expected rate cuts, will benefit industrial sectors and Coherent's customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>.
*   **Outlook:** Despite a projected decrease in 2024 earnings, Coherent is expected to return to double-digit growth in subsequent years, with profits potentially tripling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:26">[00:39:26]</a>. The market is already beginning to price in these future increases, hence its valuation of 27 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:35">[00:40:35]</a>.

## Druckenmiller's Advice

Miller advises investors to:
*   Imagine what the world will be like in 12 to 24 months (or up to 2 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>.
*   Avoid buying into current fads or sectors experiencing euphoria, as this is often the worst time to buy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   Look for companies that are cheap or going through a difficult period, but are poised for future improvement due to underlying factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:26">[00:37:26]</a>. This aligns with his own practice of [[strategies_for_finding_undervalued_stocks | finding undervalued stocks]] and [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies | investing in undervalued companies]].

In conclusion, Staly Druen Miller's strategy for 2025 involves a calculated shift away from currently overvalued technology sectors towards [[investment opportunities in various sectors and companies | undervalued industrial]], energy, and real estate companies that are expected to benefit from anticipated macroeconomic changes, such as Fed rate cuts and dollar devaluation. His approach emphasizes forward-looking analysis and counter-cyclical investment to capitalize on future market shifts.

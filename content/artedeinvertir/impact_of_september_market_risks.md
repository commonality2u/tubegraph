Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater team have indicated a new risk for the stock market in September, predicting a potential drop of 20% to 25% beyond existing declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This new risk, primarily related to the withdrawal of stimulus, is expected to complicate the market significantly starting in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Current Market Risks

The market is currently navigating three major risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:
1.  **Pressure from Multiples** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>: The S&P 500, which was at 24 times earnings, has fallen to around 17 times earnings, and reached 14 times in June/July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. This risk is considered somewhat implicit in current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Drop in Profits (Recession)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>: A recession typically causes corporate profits to drop by 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This risk is not yet fully accounted for in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity in the System** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>: Easy and abundant money encourages investment and business confidence, but this is closely tied to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.

### Interconnection of Risks
The second and third risks are highly correlated:
*   Rapid interest rate hikes can lead to a recession, causing profits to drop, which is negative for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   If the Fed avoids a recession by not raising rates aggressively, [[impact_of_inflation_on_the_market | inflation]] problems will persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
It is highly probable that at least two of these three risks will materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

## Quantitative Tightening (QT)

The new and equally dangerous risk is Quantitative Tightening (QT), the opposite of Quantitative Easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Central banks have two main tools: printing/withdrawing money and setting [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_market_trends | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. While recent drops have been mainly due to [[impact_of_interest_rate_hikes_on_financial_markets | interest rates]] affecting valuations against bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, QT involves actively withdrawing money that was previously printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

This comes at a critical time as central banks fight [[impact_of_inflation_on_the_market | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. QT officially begins in September, with a monthly withdrawal of $90-95 billion, totaling almost a trillion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Historical data shows that the market performs worst during periods of money withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, as seen in 2018 when a bear market resulted from a lack of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Advice

Ray Dalio and Bridgewater emphasize that it's impossible to completely avoid the market downturn; it will affect all investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Key recommendations include:
*   **Reduce risks** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>
*   **Diversify globally at the asset level**: include bonds and quality non-cyclical stocks from companies with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.
*   **Diversify sectorally**: avoid sectors highly sensitive to the economic cycle or profit drops, such as automotive, banks, insurance, construction, transportation (airlines), and raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>.
*   Gold is not historically a safe haven in these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Opportunities

### Historical Context
September is historically the worst month for the stock market, often attributed to psychological factors as people return from vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:20">[01:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:50">[01:27:50]</a>. In contrast, October through April are typically among the best months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

### Positive Indicators
*   [[Impact of inflation and interest rates on markets | Inflation]] data for August is expected to show a drop, similar to July <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:50">[01:53:50]</a>.
*   Inflation in the US is projected to moderate by May/June 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>.
*   The Federal Reserve plans aggressive rate hikes followed by holding rates, with potential reductions if inflation calms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:59">[01:55:59]</a>.
*   European market valuations have reached "ridiculous levels," comparable to the 2020 lockdown or even the 2008 crisis for individual shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:04">[02:16:04]</a>.
*   Excluding the top 10 largest stocks in the S&P 500, the remaining 490 are trading about 10% cheaper than their historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:36">[02:51:36]</a>.
*   Historically, drops in corporate profits reverse very quickly, leading to strong market recoveries within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:28">[02:51:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:34">[02:51:34]</a>.
*   Market downturns create significant investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:30">[02:13:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

### Investor Sentiment
Consumer and investor negativity is starting to decline significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>. Despite historical trends of stock market increases (over 90-95% of the time in 10-15 year periods), about 40% of people expect stock prices to go down next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>. People's exposure to stocks is still high, not as low as in 2008, suggesting that further outflows of capital could cause more volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>. This is precisely when it becomes more interesting to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:03">[02:44:03]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: Lessons from François Rosón

François Rosón, a top Canadian asset manager, offers valuable insights:
*   **Long-Term Focus**: Invests only for the long term, expecting shares to perform, without short-selling or complex derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Maintains a diversified portfolio of 15-25 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.
*   **Quality and Growth**: Favors profitable, quality companies with consistent growth (preferably double-digits), low debt, and low cyclicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. Avoids trendy, unprofitable companies that abuse shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>.
*   **Company Earnings**: The key to successful investing is accurately predicting a company's earnings in 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Factors like market size, market growth, market share, and capital allocation are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: While valuation matters, being slightly off on multiples (e.g., 14.5x vs. 13.7x earnings) is less critical than fundamental business understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. A good business can still provide good returns even at 30-40 times earnings if it grows significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Formula for Value Increase**: Company value increases based on profit growth plus shareholder yield (dividends + share buybacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.
*   **Errors of Omission**: A common mistake is failing to buy a good company because its valuation seems slightly high, even if all other analysis is positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.
*   **Sectoral Tailwinds**: Investing in sectors with strong tailwinds (e.g., essential goods, non-cyclical services) can provide a competitive advantage and a layer of security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

### Specific Company Examples
François Rosón's portfolio includes quality companies like:
*   **Five Below**: A discount retail business thriving because selling its low-priced items online is unprofitable, and it has a strong scale advantage in inventory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:00">[00:54:00]</a>. Its earnings per share are projected to grow significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.
*   **Progressive Corporation**: A low-cost auto insurer, similar to GEICO (100% owned by Warren Buffett), which benefits from low costs, a growing market share, and the "float" (prepaid premiums that can be invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:08">[01:06:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:12">[01:08:12]</a>.
*   **Carmax**: Revolutionized the used car market in the US by professionalizing sales with transparent, fixed pricing and strong customer service, building a trusted brand and scale advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:56">[01:17:56]</a>. It continues to gain market share in a large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:39">[01:19:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:46">[01:22:46]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding market risks, especially the incoming Quantitative Tightening, and applying sound investment principles like global and sectoral diversification are crucial. While volatility is expected, current valuations present opportunities for long-term investors focused on quality companies with clear growth prospects. Avoid short-term speculation and focus on fundamental analysis to make informed decisions.

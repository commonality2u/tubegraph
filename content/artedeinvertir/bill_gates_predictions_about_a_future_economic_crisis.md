Bill Gates, one of the world's wealthiest and most influential individuals, has recently begun selling a significant portion of his stock market shares, a move that aligns with his [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | predictions of a new economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He has publicly stated that it is "practically certain" that the world will experience a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. These actions and statements prompt reflection on the future of the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Acumen and Influence

With a fortune exceeding $120 billion, Bill Gates is recognized as the fourth richest person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. While famous for co-founding Microsoft, he is also an accomplished investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His investments in Microsoft shares constitute only 40% of his assets, with the remaining 60% diversified across a stock portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. His excellent understanding of the economy and stock market lends weight to his recent portfolio adjustments and statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Past Predictions and Current Economic Concerns

[[bill_gates_role_in_pandemic_prediction_and_preparation | Bill Gates has played an important role during recent crises]] by accurately forewarning of a likely global pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. He also predicted which company would first develop a vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. More recently, he has provided an estimated date for when the current crisis is expected to end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

During a live Q&A session, when asked about the possibility of an economic crisis similar to 2008, Gates responded:
> "If it is certain that we will have a crisis similar to that of 2008 in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

This vision of the future is widely believed to be influencing his accelerated sale of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Transparency in Investments

Professional investors with portfolios exceeding $100 million are required by stock market transparency rules to periodically report their shareholdings, purchases, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This public information allows for insights into the future outlooks of major investors like Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

## Reasons for Stock Sales and Portfolio Shifts

Recent reports from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, his investment vehicle, show that he has begun selling 11 of the 18 shares in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. In a February CNN interview, he warned that the current global problem could persist longer than anticipated, leading to serious economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>. He specifically stated:
> "The big problem is that we are not doing enough to end the pandemic globally. Vaccines are only reaching rich countries, which increases the risk that new variants will spread to other countries and return to the US creating new infections. This is the main risk for the economy in the coming months and it is a factor that must be monitored very closely" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Selling Off Tech and High-Valuation Stocks

Bill Gates' recent investment activity shows three key trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
1.  **Selling Technology Stocks**: He has divested from technology stocks such as Amazon, Google, and Apple, which were major beneficiaries of recent global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.
2.  **Exiting Uber**: All shares of Uber were sold due to its high valuation and fragility during an economic downturn, as these companies often do not produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Such stocks have seen sharp declines recently, while more traditional stocks have maintained their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
3.  **Selling Alibaba**: All shares in Alibaba were sold at $225 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite being an excellent company with good prospects, recent issues with Chinese regulators caused investor panic and a sharp fall in stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This represents a "tail risk" – unlikely but with severe potential consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### The "Great Rotation"

Gates' portfolio adjustments suggest he is positioning for what is known as the "great rotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. In recent years, investments in technology, disruptive companies, and startups have seen significant revaluations, while traditional and conservative companies have seen little benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.However, these traditional companies are now trading at attractive valuations due to previously low interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Bill Gates appears to be anticipating a shift of capital from disruptive/technological companies to these more traditional ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. He is focusing investments on traditional, defensive companies that are more resilient to a potential economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Optimistic Investments

Despite his cautious outlook, Bill Gates maintains optimism about the future of certain investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>:

*   **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A / BRK.B)**: His largest investment, accounting for 43% of his portfolio and over $9 billion, is in Warren Buffett's business holding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. This reflects the strong friendship and confidence between Gates and Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is positioned to withstand various economic environments and provide acceptable returns, with estimated profit and book value growth of 7-12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. It is considered a very conservative and safe investment against crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Waste Management (WM)**: This American company represents 10% of his portfolio, an investment of over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. As the leading US waste collection and recycling company, it is a traditional business, highly resilient to crises, and predictable across economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The recycling market is projected to grow at 9% annually, well above GDP, especially in North America where Waste Management operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Walmart (WMT)**: Bill Gates has invested 9% of his portfolio in Walmart, the largest global supermarket chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. Walmart is another conservative company that performs well in any economic climate, offering moderate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Canadian National Railway (CNI)**: He also holds shares in this Canadian railway company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Railroad companies are considered among the safest investments in the transportation sector due to their control over established lines and the unlikelihood of rival infrastructure development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. Rail remains a cost-competitive technology for transporting raw materials and industrial goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. Its profits have historically grown at 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Other Blue Chips**: Gates has also maintained high-quality "blue-chip" companies in his portfolio, such as FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. These large-cap companies provide stable returns with few surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### New High-Growth Investment

The only new stock Bill Gates has recently purchased is **Schrödinger (SDR)**, investing over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Schrödinger is an innovative company that uses a new technological platform to help pharmaceutical companies develop drugs and vaccines more quickly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Despite currently not producing benefits and trading at a demanding valuation (over 40 times sales), it has high future growth potential, with the US medical research and clinical trials market valued at $47 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Gates' investment in Schrödinger suggests a very long-term view, anticipating significant growth if the company captures a substantial share of this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.

## Prediction for Economic Normalization

Concerning [[bill_gates_on_the_end_of_the_current_crisis | Bill Gates' prediction on the end of the current crisis]], he stated that contrary to the belief of many that normalcy might return by the end of 2021, he believes it will happen at the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. This more conservative outlook on the future of the economy is a primary reason for the changes made to his investment portfolio for the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The [[impact_of_bill_gates_predictions_on_global_economics | impact of Bill Gates' predictions on global economics]] is significant, as his portfolio adjustments reflect a strategic response to these anticipated challenges.

The 2030 Agenda, also known as global objectives or the global agenda for the world, represents a significant economic and social reform with serious implications for savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This plan is already underway, and its first consequences are becoming apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Key Supporters and Organizations
The 2030 Agenda enjoys broad support from various powerful figures and organizations globally:

*   **Influential Individuals**
    *   **Bill Gates:** Named as one of the most powerful people supporting the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. He has been seen presenting the agenda's symbolic pins to world leaders like the President of Spain and the King of Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. Bill Gates is also the founder of Microsoft, a company whose shift to a subscription model aligns with the agenda's economic principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
    *   **Bill Clinton:** Identified among the powerful figures endorsing the agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.
    *   **Ray Dalio:** An [[influential_investment_figures | influential investment figure]] who participates in the Davos Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He has highlighted risks related to the United States no longer being the world's leading power in his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
    *   **Klaus Schwab:** Leads the Davos Forum, also known as the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. He is seen as the person driving policies to reshape the economic and social reality for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
    *   **Ida Auken:** A significant Danish politician involved in promoting key economic reforms associated with the 2030 Agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. She famously summarized the agenda's economic vision with the statement: "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
    *   **Warren Buffett:** Recognized as one of the best investors globally, he began investing in the oil sector months before prices surged, demonstrating a vision that aligned with the changing economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

*   **Global Bodies and Forums**
    *   **United Nations:** Provides support for the 2030 Agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.
    *   **Davos Forum (World Economic Forum):** This forum is where the new economic plan originated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. It convenes world leaders, powerful businessmen, and presidents of state to debate and establish economic policies that are subsequently implemented at a local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The World Economic Forum published a promotional video titled "Eight Predictions for the World in the Year 2030" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

*   **Political Leaders:** The agenda has the support of the majority of presidents of state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Presidents, such as those of Spain and France, have been observed wearing the 17-section emblem representing the agenda's objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Economic Impact and Policy Alignment
The policies of the 2030 Agenda are believed by many experts and economists to be a cause of the current economic crisis, particularly due to high inflation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The motto of this global campaign is "You will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

### Shift from Ownership to Rental
A core economic change promoted by the agenda is the shift from owning items to renting or long-term leasing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. This shift is proving highly beneficial for a select group of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Cars:** Many people now rent cars through leasing or bank financing, with 70% of vehicles sold in the US being financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.
*   **Smartphones:** Most individuals rent their iPhones from Apple for a monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Housing:** A significant portion of the population does not own their homes, opting for mortgages or monthly rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Media:** Movies are accessed via monthly subscription services like Netflix instead of being bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Feature Subscriptions:** Companies like BMW have announced plans to charge monthly fees for car features like heated seats, sports sounds, or adaptive headlights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. This trend, if encouraged by political and economic powers, could become a new standard, forcing consumers to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

Historically, coordinated actions by industries to force greater consumer spending would be considered monopolistic abuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. However, when these practices align with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda or "Great Reset," they are approved and even encouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

### Corporate Beneficiaries
Several major corporations have significantly benefited from this new economic model:
*   **Microsoft:** Founded by Bill Gates, Microsoft shifted its model from selling perpetual software licenses to charging monthly or annual subscriptions for products like Microsoft Office <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This change transformed the company's stock from a "boring" lateral behavior to an exponential rise, multiplying its value by more than ten times since 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. While previously investigated for monopolistic practices, current similar behaviors are approved due to their alignment with the 2030 Agenda's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Adobe:** Similar to Microsoft, Adobe transitioned from selling expensive perpetual licenses for products like Adobe PDF and Photoshop to offering smaller monthly subscriptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. This change, implemented around 2012, led to its stock multiplying by over 12 times and continuous growth in profits and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Automotive Financial Divisions:** The financial divisions of car companies like Volkswagen and Renault are often more profitable than the car manufacturing business itself, benefiting from vehicle financing and rental models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

### Energy Transition Policies
Predictions within the 2030 Agenda also address environmental protection through radical measures, such as the complete elimination of fossil fuels without a clear energy transition plan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>. This includes proposals to establish price limits on gas and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. This push against fossil fuels, coinciding with the agenda's implementation over the last seven years, has led to a significant drop in investment in oil exploitation and production (down 60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. This lack of investment is a major contributor to the current high energy prices and the global inflation crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Oil and gas companies have been stellar investments in 2022 due to these high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

## Predictions for Global Power Shifts
One particularly striking prediction from the World Economic Forum is that the United States will no longer be the world's leading power, replaced by a small number of other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. In this scenario, the dollar would lose its status as the most important currency, and the US would decline due to accumulated debt and rising political populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. The dollar's market share has already fallen from 70% to 60%, being replaced by other currencies, particularly the [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | Chinese yuan]] and other Asian currencies, which are areas of current economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

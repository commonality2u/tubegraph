Investing in companies with small capital can offer significant [[advantages_of_investing_in_smaller_lesserknown_companies | advantages]], potentially generating much higher returns than investing in large, well-known corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. This strategy is particularly relevant for individuals starting to [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | invest in the stock market with little money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Perspective on Small Investments

Warren Buffett has stated that with a small amount of money, it's possible to achieve annual returns of up to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. In a 1999 interview with BusinessWeek magazine, he emphasized that not having a lot of money is a "very big structural advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He claimed he could make a 50% annual return if he managed less than a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

Buffett's own returns have naturally decreased over time as his capital grew; while he once saw 50% annual returns, a 10% return is now considered good given his current asset management level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. He confirmed that if he were working with a small sum, he would "do things completely different" from his current approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

## Why Small Companies Offer Opportunities

The key to achieving high returns with smaller capital lies in looking for companies that are "off the map," often small and local <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

*   **Expanded Universe of Choices**: With small sums, the investment universe greatly expands to thousands of companies, whereas managing enormous capital severely limits options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.
*   **Less Scrutiny**: Of the more than 30,000 companies listed in the U.S., only about 500 are in the Standard and Poor's index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. These 500 largest companies are extensively analyzed, making it difficult to generate annual returns above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. The other 29,500 companies are less known and can present more opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.
*   **"Local" Businesses**: Warren Buffett emphasizes looking for "local" companies, meaning those that are not globalized or international, as these are typically not found in major indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## [[Investment_strategy_for_small_caps | Investment Strategy for Small Caps]]

### Investing Time and Effort
[[opportunities_in_lesserknown_and_undervalued_companies | Opportunities in lesser-known and undervalued companies]] won't present themselves; investors must dedicate time and effort to find them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This means actively seeking out companies that are not widely followed by analysts or known by many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

### [[Understanding_companies_before_investing | Understanding Companies Before Investing]]
Warren Buffett advises learning as much as possible about all kinds of American stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Success in the stock market is a combination of opportunity and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>. If an investor is not prepared to identify opportunities, they cannot take advantage of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

This involves:
*   **Investigating all shares**: Historically, this meant poring over physical Moody's manuals, which provided detailed historical data for thousands of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.
*   **Building mental models**: Learning about each type of industry helps in recognizing good investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Utilizing modern tools**: Today, free online platforms like Yahoo Finance and Morningstar.com offer similar historical data (sales, profits, shares in circulation, ownership) for listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.
*   **Stock "Screens"**: Computer tools called "screens" allow investors to filter stocks by specific parameters like low P/E ratios, growth rates, or profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

### Focus on Specific Industries
To avoid feeling overwhelmed, it's recommended to choose an attractive industry (e.g., health, IT, technology, transportation) and learn as much as possible about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Start by reading reports from the largest companies in that sector, as they often provide the most detailed information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Once knowledgeable, then look for smaller, potentially [[evaluating_smallcap_stocks | undervalued companies]] within that sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

### Importance of a Low P/E Ratio
To generate extraordinary returns (e.g., 50% annually), it is essential to focus on investments that are "very, very cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>.

*   A stock trading at $10 and earning $1 per share has a P/E of 10, likely yielding a return of around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   However, if a stock earning $1 per share is trading at $2, it has a P/E of 2, which could theoretically yield a 50% annual return (1/2 = 0.50, or 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Real-Life Examples

### Western Insurance
Warren Buffett recalled finding Western Insurance trading at $3 a share, while it was making $20 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He tried to buy as much as possible, highlighting that such opportunities are not widely publicized and must be discovered through diligent research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Humanice
An example from the True fund involved Humanice in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. At the time, the fund managed only 9 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

*   Humanice was a small, "micro company" with a capitalization of barely 30 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
*   It was largely ignored by the market and analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.
*   The business was sound, had little debt, and nothing was fundamentally wrong with it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.
*   It was trading at 1.50 euros per share, with projected earnings of 1 euro per share for the following year, resulting in a P/E ratio of less than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   The fund accumulated a position of around 1 million euros over four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   Three years later, the shares traded at 6 euros, multiplying the purchase price by four and generating a 3.2 million euro profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Korean Stocks (Daehan Flour)
Around 2004, Warren Buffett spent several hours scanning a book on Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He found several interesting opportunities and invested 100 million dollars divided among 20 Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

*   One example was Daehan Flour, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   Its earnings per share had been consistent (2,800 won, 18,000 won, 23,800 won), and it had 100,000 won per share in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   The stock was trading at 38,000 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Buffett noted that you "have to make money buying stocks like this at twice the profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   The stock quickly appreciated to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Persistence of Opportunities

These types of investment opportunities have always existed and will continue to exist in the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. The nature of markets means that by having the necessary passion, curiosity, hard work, and by doing things differently than other investors, it is possible to find these situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

> When an investor becomes highly successful and manages significant capital, they may eventually be unable to access these [[small_cap_vs_large_cap_companies | small cap]] companies due to liquidity issues, as there may not be enough shares in circulation to invest large sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This ensures that the opportunities for smaller investors persist.

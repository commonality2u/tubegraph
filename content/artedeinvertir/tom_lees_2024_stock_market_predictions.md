Financial analyst Tom Lee, founder of FStat advisory and consulting firm, presented his outlook for the stock market in 2024, predicting a strong year and highlighting specific investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Lee previously served as chief strategy analyst at JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

Lee accurately [[predictions_on_stock_market_risks_for_2024 | predicted the significant rise]] in the Nasdaq and S&P 500 in 2023, a forecast many initially dismissed as contrary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## 2024 Market Outlook: A Bullish Year

Tom Lee believes 2024 will be a very bullish year for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Unlike 2023, where gains were largely driven by the "magnificent seven" large companies (e.g., Google, Facebook, Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>, Lee anticipates broader market participation, a phenomenon known as "market breadth" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. This means a greater number of stocks will contribute to index increases, indicating more solidity in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. Historically, when leading stocks rise and this breadth is consolidated, it often signals a sustained bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This is linked to human psychology: when most market participants are winning, confidence increases, encouraging further investment and generating a "feeling of wealth" that boosts consumption and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

### Key Reasons for a Bullish 2024

Lee outlines five primary reasons for his optimistic outlook on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>:

#### 1. Capital Flows
Capital flows significantly influence short-to-medium-term stock market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. From 2022 to the end of 2023, investors withdrew over $240 billion from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>. This money was largely redirected to short-term, low-risk investments like bank deposits or treasury bills, which offered attractive returns (around 4-5.5%) due to rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Currently, there are $5.5 trillion held in these short-term investments that Lee expects to return to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. Even if only 10-20% of this capital returns to the stock market, it would lead to significant increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. The reversal of this flow is anticipated because central banks are expected to lower interest rates in 2024, making these safe, short-term investments less attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This shift, driven by investor desire for higher returns, will likely propel money back into equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

In 2021, the market saw euphoria and massive capital inflows into stocks, the opposite of the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Extreme capital outflows, such as those observed in 2002 and March 2009, have historically been excellent times to invest in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

#### 2. Federal Reserve (Fed) Policy
Unlike 2022 and 2023, the Fed has clearly indicated its intention to lower interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. This is typically bullish, especially if there is no recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:08">[00:22:08]</a>. Current Q4 data and early Q1 data suggest no recession, with GDP pointing to solid 2.5% increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:13">[00:22:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:21">[00:22:21]</a>. Historically, in non-recessionary scenarios, the stock market tends to rise significantly in the six months prior to a rate cut (around 20%) and sees spectacular increases (over 50% on average) within two years after the cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:00">[00:23:00]</a>.

It is crucial to understand *why* the Fed is cutting rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>. If rates are cut because inflation is under control, it is "tremendously bullish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:40">[00:23:40]</a>. However, if cuts are due to deteriorating economic growth, it would be "very bearish" for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:55">[00:23:55]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>. The market is currently anticipating rate cuts, leading to renewed confidence and a shift from safe assets to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.

#### 3. Housing Market
The housing market significantly impacts the overall economy and recession risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>. Mortgage rates have already decreased from 8% for 30-year mortgages to 6.5% and are expected to continue falling, potentially reaching 5% by the end of 2024 and 3-4% by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:53">[00:24:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:51">[00:25:51]</a>. This decline in financing costs for mortgages and large purchases (e.g., automobiles, furniture) should stimulate the real estate sector and the broader economy, reducing the risk of recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:57">[00:24:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:03">[00:25:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:18">[00:26:18]</a>.

#### 4. 10-Year Bond Yield
The 10-year bond yield is highly correlated with stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>. A falling yield is considered very bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:39">[00:26:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:50">[00:26:50]</a>. When the S&P 500 is in an upward trend (as it is now, reaching new highs) and yields are falling, the S&P 500 has historically delivered exceptional returns, averaging 14% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:03">[00:27:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">[00:27:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:45">[00:27:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:49">[00:27:49]</a>. This is because falling bond yields encourage investors to shift from bonds to more profitable stocks, boosting the equity market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:54">[00:27:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities: Small Caps

Tom Lee highlights small caps, specifically the Russell 2000 index, as a star investment category with potential to rise up to 50% in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>. He notes that the Russell 2000 is currently trading around 2000 points and could literally reach 3000 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. ETFs like IWM track the Russell 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

### Why Small Caps?
1.  **Debt Sensitivity**: Small caps generally carry more debt than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:20">[00:31:20]</a>. While rising interest rates harmed them by increasing interest payments and reducing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:25">[00:31:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:27">[00:31:27]</a>, anticipated rate cuts will reverse this effect, leading to faster profit recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:37">[00:31:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
2.  **Disproportionate Decline**: Small caps fell more than large companies during the 2022-2023 bear market due to perceived higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>. Despite this, their profits have grown at a similar or even higher rate than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:48">[00:30:48]</a>.
3.  **Attractive Valuations**: Small caps currently trade at significantly lower valuations than large companies. Large companies are around 20 times earnings, while small caps are at 13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:57">[00:31:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:55">[00:36:55]</a>. Even with a 50% increase, small caps would still be cheaper than large companies at 19 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:04">[00:32:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>.
4.  **Historical Precedent**: The current market situation, where the S&P 500 is at all-time highs but small caps are not (accumulating a 20% drop), has only occurred three times in 40 years (1985, 1991, 1999) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:10">[00:33:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:23">[00:33:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>. In all three previous instances, the Russell 2000 significantly outperformed the S&P 500 in the following 12 months, with gains of 36%, 35%, and 18% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:01">[00:34:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:15">[00:34:15]</a>. This historical pattern suggests a potential for a multi-year bull market for small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>.

### Enhancing Small Cap Performance
An additional strategy to boost small cap returns is to invest only in profitable companies within the small cap universe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a>. Dimensional Fund Advisors (DFA), with a 45-year track record in small caps, employs this philosophy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:33">[00:41:33]</a>. Their strategy of excluding unprofitable companies has historically yielded a 13.3% annual return, compared to 10.7% for the entire Russell 2000, leading to triple the capital over 45 years due to compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:05">[00:42:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:35">[00:43:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:43">[00:43:43]</a>.

## Specific Small Cap Company Examples

The Dimensional Fund Advisors' top equity holdings include regional banks like First Bank Corp, consumer retail companies like Cromb Fit, and construction materials companies like Voice Cascade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:25">[00:48:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:37">[00:48:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:58">[00:48:58]</a>. The speaker also highlights specific examples of profitable small caps:

### Griffon Corporation (GRF)
*   **Business**: Manufactures garage doors for both residential and commercial use, holding approximately 50% market share in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:29">[00:50:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:57">[00:50:57]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Benefits from a strong network of maintenance distributors and scale advantages in manufacturing, allowing it to offer quality products at competitive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:03">[00:51:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:09">[00:51:09]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: The U.S. has a significant deficit in new home construction since the 2008 crisis, suggesting future demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:22">[00:51:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:26">[00:51:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:38">[00:57:38]</a>. A large part of sales comes from remodeling and maintenance, making the business less cyclical than imagined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:14">[00:52:14]</a>.
*   **Financials**: Despite a slight decrease in 2023 due to interest rates, profit levels have continued to grow since 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:28">[00:53:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:35">[00:53:35]</a>. The doors segment generates the majority of its profit (around $500 million) with strong margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:30">[00:52:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:33">[00:52:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:38">[00:52:38]</a>. Operating margins with maintenance CAPEX are 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:00">[00:56:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading at 13 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:41">[00:59:41]</a>, historically lower than its average of 20-30 times earnings seen before 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:58">[00:58:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>. This suggests significant upside potential, aligning with Lee's prediction of a 50% rise for small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

### Ensign Group (ENSG)
*   **Business**: Manages nursing homes, a complex, regulated sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:31">[01:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:40">[01:01:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:43">[01:01:43]</a>.
*   **Growth Strategy**: Ensign Group has grown from seven residences to 300 by acquiring smaller, often poorly managed residences from "mom and pop" operators and integrating them into their professionalized management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:59">[01:02:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:02">[01:03:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:33">[01:02:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:44">[01:02:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. This "buy and build" strategy leverages their operational expertise to improve profitability and value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:58">[01:07:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:01">[01:08:01]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:09">[01:08:09]</a>.
*   **Tailwinds**: Benefits from a massive aging population in the U.S. and Europe, ensuring recurring revenue and demand for nursing home services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:17">[01:02:17]</a>. Government spending on elderly care (Medicare) is projected to increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:06">[01:09:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:14">[01:10:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>.
*   **Financials**: Consistently grows revenue and profits at around 15% annually, making it highly predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:28">[01:04:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:30">[01:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:39">[01:04:39]</a>. The stock market has reflected this growth with 15-20% annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:43">[01:04:43]</a>.
*   **Risks**:
    *   **Regulatory Risk**: Around half of Ensign's income comes from government payments (Medicare). Changes in government rates could impact profitability, though rate cuts would likely hurt smaller, less efficient competitors more, creating acquisition opportunities for Ensign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:05">[01:12:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:15">[01:12:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>.
    *   **Operational Risk**: Scandals or poor management could negatively impact the company, as seen with European operator Orpea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:15">[01:11:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:19">[01:11:19]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading at around 23 times earnings, which is above its historical average of 18, but not considered a "bubble" given its growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:28">[01:13:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>. The market expects its 15% annual growth to be rewarded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Risk Management

The speaker emphasizes several core principles for successful investing:
*   **Long-Term Vision and Patience**: Investors should focus on the long term, be patient, and seize short-term opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>.

There are no shortcuts; consistent learning improves performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09">[01:35:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:20">[01:35:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:01">[01:46:01]</a>.
*   **Psychology of the Market**: Short-to-medium-term market movements are often driven by "greed or fear" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:07">[00:26:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:10">[00:26:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. Controlling emotions is vital to avoid selling at lows or missing opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: Maintaining a diversified portfolio helps mitigate risks and allows for asymmetric profit situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:19">[01:48:19]</a>.
*   **CEO Departures**: While negative news, the departure or even death of a CEO is not necessarily the end of a company, especially if it has a strong board, management structure, and a proven business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:02">[01:25:02]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:06">[01:25:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:35">[01:31:35]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:41">[01:31:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:48">[01:31:48]</a>. Examples like Middleby, Itelink, and Roper Technologies demonstrate that companies can continue to perform well or even better under new leadership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:11">[01:25:11]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:13">[01:25:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:47">[01:25:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:22">[01:30:22]</a>.
*   **Market Overreactions**: The market often exaggerates reactions to news, creating opportunities for informed investors. For example, Concentrix's stock fell 16% despite better-than-expected results, likely due to nervousness around artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:48">[01:35:48]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:50">[01:35:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:58">[01:35:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:01">[01:36:01]</a>. Similarly, Net Company, a comparable European company, saw a significant rise on modest growth forecasts because sector expectations were extremely low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:30">[01:40:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:33">[01:40:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:40">[01:40:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:43">[01:40:43]</a>.

The speaker concludes that despite market highs, many high-quality companies with record profits are still trading at discounted valuations, especially within small caps, making the current environment interesting for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:50">[01:42:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:03">[01:43:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:05">[01:43:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:58">[01:44:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:01">[01:45:01]</a>.

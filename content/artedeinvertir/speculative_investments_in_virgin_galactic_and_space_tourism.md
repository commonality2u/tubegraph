Virgin Galactic (ticker SPF) is an ambitious project by Richard Branson, aiming to become the first space tourism company in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. As of the time of the discussion, its shares were priced at $22 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>.

## Business Model and Services
Initially, Virgin Galactic plans to offer suborbital flights where participants can experience weightlessness for a few minutes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>. The company's long-term ambition is to conduct authentic space flights, though this is still a distant goal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The potential market for such services could be very large if priced appropriately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. However, the current charge for the limited suborbital experience is over $250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>.

## Financial Standing and Challenges
Despite accepting reservations since 2004, Virgin Galactic currently has no income and loses more than $200 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. In 2014, the company faced issues with an experimental flight, which led to the program being halted and significant investment in security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Companies like Virgin Galactic often rely on maintaining a high share price on the stock market to issue new shares and finance their growth plans, as serious banks typically do not provide financing to companies with no income and substantial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>.

### Customer Deposits
To assess the growth of the company's reserves, one must examine the "customer deposit" line item on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. From 2019 to 2020, customer deposits increased minimally from $80 million to $83 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This represents very low growth, especially when compared to the company's "stratospheric valuation" of over $5 billion on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.

### Liquidity and Dilution Risk
Virgin Galactic has approximately $400 million in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. With an annual cash outflow of $250 million, this liquidity would only last for about a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. After this period, the company would need to issue new shares to fund future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a>.

*   **Impact of Share Price on Dilution**:
    *   If the company issues 10% new shares at the current price ($22), it would raise $500 million, providing an additional two years of funding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   However, if shares were to drop to $5, raising the same $500 million would require issuing four times more shares, resulting in a 40% dilution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>. Such a high dilution would be catastrophic for the future share price and revaluation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Highly Speculative Investment
Investments in Virgin Galactic are considered highly speculative because the company currently has no income and incurs very high losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. Its continued operation relies on constantly issuing new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. The company itself is uncertain about when it will have a profitable project or safely conduct space flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.

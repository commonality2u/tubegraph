Warren Buffett has recently invested an impressive sum of $7 billion in a new sector and a specific stock, requesting the SEC to keep these purchases secret until legally required to be made public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This investment highlights [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's investment strategy]], particularly his continued interest in the insurance sector, which has historically yielded significant returns for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Why Insurance? The "Float" Advantage

The insurance sector is one of the most profitable for [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] throughout his history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. The key to this profitability is what [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] calls the "float" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

### Understanding the Float
The "float" is money that insurance companies possess from premiums but that does not yet belong to them, allowing them to invest it for their benefit before paying out claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. For example, when a policyholder pays $1,000 for car insurance, the insurer can invest this money for typically 1 to 3 years until potential compensation is paid, which on average might only be $900 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This practice is legal and provides a significant advantage over banks, which typically have to pay interest on deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

Insurers profit not only from selling the insurance itself (which has a profit margin) but also from investing the float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Regulations typically limit the risk of these investments, requiring the majority to be in low-risk assets like treasury bills or short-term bonds, with only a small portion (e.g., 10-15%) in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]], being adept at stock investing, leverages this float by investing a larger portion in stocks than traditional insurers, thereby accelerating wealth generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. Studies suggest that 40-50% of Berkshire Hathaway's performance stems from the intelligent use of this float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Berkshire Hathaway's Float
As of March 2024, Berkshire Hathaway holds a float of $168 billion from its insurance businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Even with a conservative 5-7% annual return on this float, it can generate over $20 billion in pre-tax profits, representing a substantial flow of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. This float has continuously grown over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Historical Success: Geico
One of the most successful historical investments in the insurance sector for [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] is Geico, a low-cost automobile insurance company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Geico's income has grown from very little in 1998 to almost $20 billion, contributing significantly to [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett's fortune]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. The insurance sector, as a whole, represents a large portion of Berkshire Hathaway's holding company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

## Chubb (CB): Buffett's Latest Move

[[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] is aggressively investing in Chubb (ticker: CB), an insurance company that was at an all-time high when he made the initial large investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This demonstrates that even top investors buy at highs, especially when the stock is valued lower than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

### Business Model and Competitive Advantage
Chubb specializes in property insurance, including home, car, health, and accident insurance, and even agricultural insurance for farmers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. The company primarily focuses on selling insurance to corporations rather than directly to individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:43">[00:26:43]</a>.

A key competitive advantage for insurers like Chubb is "Big Data" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. By processing extensive historical data on various risks, they can accurately price new policies, ensuring profitability and protecting against losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. This creates a "moat" that discourages competitors from entering the market by undercutting prices, as it would lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:36">[00:27:36]</a>.

Chubb's combined ratio (profit margin from insurance sales: 100 - combined ratio) consistently outperforms rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:39">[00:28:39]</a>. Last year, Chubb's combined ratio was 86%, meaning a 14% profit margin on insurance sales, indicating strong discipline in issuing policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.

### Financial Prudence
Chubb manages its investments prudently, with a book value of $60 billion and only $15 billion in debt, resulting in a low debt-to-book value ratio of approximately 0.25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:02">[00:30:02]</a>. It holds a high credit rating of double-A from S&P, indicating very high credit quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:25">[00:30:25]</a>.

The company's investment philosophy for its float is conservative: 84% is invested in debt with a maximum duration of 5 years, making it less susceptible to interest rate fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>. 93% of its portfolio consists of high-quality bonds (double-A to triple-B) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.

Chubb's investment income from its float has been significant, reaching $5 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. This profit from float investments accounts for nearly 60% of its total pre-tax profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.

### Speculation on Full Acquisition
There is speculation that [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_market_outlook | Warren Buffett]]'s initial position in Chubb could be a precursor to a full acquisition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:23">[00:32:23]</a>. The allure for Buffett is Chubb's $120 billion float, which he could potentially manage to yield higher returns (e.g., 50-60% more than Chubb's current 3-4% return) if he had full control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Chubb's multi-year insurance policies mean its float is even more valuable due to longer investment horizons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:42">[00:33:42]</a>.

Chubb's earnings per share have grown from $2.5 in 2005 to $24, a more than seven-fold increase, alongside dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>. The company's profitability has improved with higher interest rates since 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. Its current valuation of 12 times earnings is in line with the insurance sector average but well below the S&P 500 average of 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:41">[00:35:41]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] likely aims for profit growth rather than multiple expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>.

## The Broader Insurance Sector

The insurance sector is currently one of the cheapest in the S&P 500 and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. Despite an estimated earnings growth of 18% for the next 3-5 years, the sector is trading at only 12 times earnings, compared to the S&P 500's 20 times and large tech companies' nearly 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

### Impact of Interest Rates
Low interest rates generally hurt insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>. Conversely, higher interest rates, such as those seen since 2022, increase the profitability of the float, as it can be invested in higher-yielding treasury bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:00">[00:35:00]</a>. This dynamic explains why the sector's profitability has improved recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:12">[00:35:12]</a>.

### Other Notable Insurance Companies
The transcript briefly mentions other insurance companies, illustrating different strategies and market niches:

*   **Kinsale Capital Group (KNSL)**: This company has delivered spectacular returns (over 30% annually in recent years, 50% analyzed return until 2023) due to its high growth and ability to reinvest its float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Kinsale specializes in "excess and surplus lines," insuring high-risk activities with specific needs, such as construction or commercial transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>. Its competitive advantages include a large risk database and "contrarian underwriting" (raising prices when others pull back after major events like hurricanes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:28">[00:40:28]</a>. Kinsale has a consistently lower combined ratio than its peers, indicating higher profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:35">[00:44:35]</a>.
*   **Markel (MKL)**: Often described as a smaller alternative to Berkshire Hathaway, Markel follows a similar business model, using its insurance float to invest in bonds, stocks, or acquire entire companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:54">[00:52:54]</a>. Markel has delivered excellent performance, with its stock growing from $8 to $1,600 per share, and its book value showing spectacular, predictable growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>. Markel's investment director, Thomas Gayner, manages its portfolio of $9 billion in equities aggressively, representing about 35% of its $26 billion float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:05">[00:55:05]</a>. The company's portfolio includes high-quality companies like Disney, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Brookfield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. Markel's price-to-book value is currently at its average of 1.4, implying future performance will depend on book value growth, which has typically been 12-13% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.

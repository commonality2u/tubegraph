In a new economic scenario characterized by inflation and a lack of economic growth, often referred to as "stagflation," [[Warren Buffetts investment advice for inflation | Warren Buffett]], considered one of the best investors in the world, has recommended specific guidelines for navigating these challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Current Economic Climate
The global economy is facing a complex situation due to the invasion of Ukraine and its ramifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The Russian economy is experiencing an "unprecedented shock," leading to concerns about a global recession, with Goldman Sachs estimating a 35% probability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Rising oil prices, which have historically correlated with economic recessions, are a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Additionally, the increasing price of raw materials and general inflation contribute to a difficult economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts recent investment strategies and tips | Warren Buffett]]'s Core Investment Principles
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy during inflation | Warren Buffett]]'s advice for such periods emphasizes two key areas, drawing parallels to his success during the high inflation, low growth, and war-conflict era of the 1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:02">[00:27:02]</a>. He achieved significant returns during this period by focusing on these principles rather than investing in raw materials, oil, or gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a>.

### 1. Invest in Yourself
[[Warren Buffetts investment advice for inflation | Warren Buffett]] first recommends investing on a personal level in one's own abilities and skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. He asserts that if you are the best in your profession (e.g., best teacher, surgeon, plumber), you will maintain your share of the national economy regardless of currency value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:29">[00:23:29]</a>. In an inflationary environment, a highly skilled professional can raise their prices or salary due to demand, providing personal protection against rising costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:50">[00:23:50]</a>. This emphasizes the value of continuous training and knowledge, as knowledge provides the power to seize opportunities in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:38">[00:24:38]</a>.

### 2. Own "Wonderful Businesses"
The second best protection during periods of inflation or economic difficulty is to own "wonderful businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:57">[00:25:57]</a>. These are defined as:
*   **Ability to easily increase prices:** Companies whose products are in high demand, allowing them to raise prices as their costs go up due to inflation. This prevents profit margins from compressing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.
*   **Ability to accommodate large increases in business volume with minimum capital investment:** Businesses that can grow their revenue significantly without needing substantial new capital expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>. This contrasts with capital-intensive businesses like road transport or airlines, which require large investments (e.g., more trucks or planes) to increase volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:32">[00:28:32]</a>.

**Examples of "Wonderful Businesses":**
*   **Apple:** People are loyal to Apple products, which are technologically advanced and purchased regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:25">[00:26:25]</a>.
*   **Visa/Mastercard:** These companies benefit from inflation as transaction values rise, and they require minimal additional capital investment to process increased volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:24">[00:35:24]</a>.
*   **Moody's:** As a debt rating agency with an oligopoly, Moody's can easily raise prices. When inflation leads to larger bond issuances, Moody's revenue increases without requiring significant capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.
*   **Google:** During the 2020 crisis, Google saw increased demand and raised prices, nearly doubling its profit level without needing proportional capital investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:41">[00:29:41]</a>.
*   **Kraft (Consumer Goods):** Companies like Kraft, producing items such as ketchup and mayonnaise, can raise prices in line with inflation because people continue to consume these necessities. Their existing factories do not require significant new investment for increased volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Businesses based on Intangibles:** [[Warren Buffetts investment insights during market crises | Warren Buffett]] has consistently invested in businesses based on intangible assets like brands (e.g., Coca-Cola), customer loyalty, or habits, which offer more enduring value than businesses based on tangible, easily replicable assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:27">[00:38:27]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies during inflationary periods | Investment Strategies During Inflationary Cycles]]
A study by Schroeders asset manager identifies assets that have historically performed best during "stagflation" (lack of growth with inflation):
*   **Gold:** Acts as a protection against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:40">[00:39:40]</a>.
*   **REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts):** These real estate investment companies listed on the stock market can perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:01">[00:40:01]</a>. Residential REITs, for example, are considered predictable and safe because housing is a necessity. They can raise rents in line with inflation and accommodate higher sales without significant new investment in maintaining properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:50">[00:43:50]</a>.
*   **Commodities:** Including oil and other materials, also tend to do well in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:08">[00:40:08]</a>.

## Long-Term Perspective and Risk Management
Despite market volatility and short-term fluctuations, a key aspect of successful investing, as demonstrated by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy during inflation | Warren Buffett]], is a long-term vision and patience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:28">[00:20:28]</a>. While even the best investors like [[Warren Buffetts investment advice for inflation | Warren Buffett]] will experience short-term losses, having trained oneself and understanding how the market works allows for navigating difficult periods and taking advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:51">[00:20:51]</a>. It's crucial to analyze and understand the intrinsic value of businesses and their risks rather than chasing performance or trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

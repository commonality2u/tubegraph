The stock market has recently experienced significant drops, leading many to question if this signals a crisis or a potential buying opportunity before markets return to all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This volatility is partly due to the Federal Reserve's decision not to introduce new measures to rescue the market; instead, they have indicated the opposite, leading to further declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. The Nasdaq, for instance, has approached a 10% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Underlying Causes
The primary triggers for the recent market falls include tariffs and uncertainty surrounding economic growth in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

### Impact of Tariffs
Tariffs are essentially a consumption tax, which leads to less consumption and, consequently, less economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. If consumers absorb price increases, it generates inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. The market dislikes tariffs due to the legal uncertainty they create for businesses, as constantly changing rules distort supply chains and increase inflation forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. This uncertainty deters companies from making long-term investments, further slowing the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Possible tariffs imposed by Trump could lead to a recession in Canada, as 25% of Canada's GDP is exported to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. Mexico also exports a significant portion (26%) of its goods to the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>. In contrast, Europe and China are more self-sufficient, with exports to the U.S. representing only 3% and 1% of their GDP, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. The speaker believes these tariffs are unlikely to be implemented due to their severe impact on complex global supply chains, as illustrated by examples in automotive and aeronautics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>.

### Federal Reserve's Stance
The Federal Reserve has stated that it is "in no hurry to lower interest rates" and can afford to wait for greater clarity, especially regarding inflation data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. They continue to affirm a high risk of inflation, prioritizing keeping interest rates high over growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>. This stance, coupled with a decline in job creation figures—reaching one of the lowest in two years—has added "fuel to the fire" for market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Opinion
Warren Buffett, usually bullish on the U.S. economy, subtly changed his tone, stating he "can't give an opinion" on the current economic situation and wouldn't talk about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He characterized tariffs as "a tax that does not pay for itself" and "an act of war" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Dollar Weakness and Market Rotation
There is speculation about a "Secret agreement" to weaken the dollar, driven by the new government's desire to promote U.S. exports and the fact that many emerging countries have dollar-denominated debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. A weaker dollar also means international investors lose money on their U.S. stock holdings, especially when stock values are also falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

A rotation in the market is occurring, where previously expensive, high-growth stocks, like those of the Magnificent Seven, are falling the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Conversely, "cheap stocks" have fallen minimally, remained stable, or even risen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

## The Importance of [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Valuation Techniques for Stocks and Investment Strategies]]
Investing requires a minimum knowledge of [[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>. Paying any price for a company, no matter how well it is performing, does not guarantee good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

**Case Study: McDonald's in the 1970s**
In 1972, McDonald's stock traded at 60 to 86 times earnings, while its earnings grew at an "outrageous" 25% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:08">[00:15:08]</a>. Despite strong business growth, investors who bought at these high [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]] saw only a 1% annual return on the stock market over the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:05">[00:16:05]</a>. This illustrates that even excellent companies can yield poor stock returns if bought at excessive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. The stock lost almost 65% of its value before recovering and stagnating for nearly 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>.

Many current market stocks trade at 50-60 times earnings, far exceeding the stock market average of 16-20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Examples include Costco at 50-60 times profits, and Win Stop at 60-80 times profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### Healthcare Sector
Healthcare companies tend to be crisis-resistant leaders in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>. European healthcare stocks are currently at cheaper [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]] compared to their U.S. counterparts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:38">[00:36:38]</a>.

*   **Fresenius (FMS):** A European stock trading at only 12 times earnings, or even 10 times earnings when excluding its stake in Fresenius Medical Care <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:30">[00:43:30]</a>. Fresenius has two main business lines:
    *   **Fresenius Kabi:** Pharmaceutical development, production, and medical equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:45">[00:37:45]</a>. This division boasts strong organic growth, projected at 8% in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:06">[00:40:06]</a>.
    *   **Helios:** Private hospitals in Spain and Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:08">[00:38:08]</a>. The aging population and worsening public healthcare systems in Europe create a megatrend for private healthcare demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:03">[00:39:03]</a>.
    *   Fresenius also owns 32% of Fresenius Medical Care (FMC), valued at €4 billion, which is a global leader in dialysis clinics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. Despite doubling from its lows, Fresenius is still considered significantly undervalued compared to its historical average of 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:04">[00:44:04]</a>.
*   **Sila Realty Trust:** A U.S. real estate investment trust (REIT) focused on healthcare properties like senior housing, clinics, and surgical hospitals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>. It trades at 11 times FFO (Funds From Operations) while paying a dividend yield of nearly 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:17">[01:16:17]</a>. The company has a low leverage of 26%, compared to the sector average of 50-60%, and its properties maintain 90-99% occupancy rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:47">[01:08:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:26">[01:16:26]</a>. Leases are typically "triple net," meaning tenants cover property taxes, maintenance, and insurance, shielding Sila from inflation and ensuring predictable cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:20">[01:09:20]</a>.

### Industrial Sector
*   **Brembo:** An Italian industrial company and the leading global manufacturer of high-performance brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:44:42]</a>. All luxury car brands, except Porsche, use Brembo brakes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>. The company benefits from its focus on the luxury market and its strong brand reputation, reinforced by its presence in Formula 1 and other motorsports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:28">[00:47:28]</a>. The electric car transition does not significantly impact Brembo, as EVs still require braking systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:41">[00:46:41]</a>. Brembo has grown sales from 500 million in 2002 to nearly 4 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. It has historically traded at 16-18 times earnings but is currently valued at only 11 times earnings, despite less debt than historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:36">[00:51:36]</a>.
*   **Fox Factory Holding:** A manufacturer of suspensions, primarily for all-terrain mountain bikes, a growing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>. It trades at 13 times last year's earnings, but if profits stabilize, it could have a P/E of 10 next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:23">[00:59:23]</a>. High value-added industrial products like Fox Factory usually trade between 15 and 20 times earnings, with a 10-year average of 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:54">[00:59:54]</a>.

### [[analysis_of_consumer_sectors_and_stock_market_behavior | Consumer Sectors and Stock Market Behavior]]
*   **Nike:** Currently trading at 43 times earnings for the next 12 months, despite expected sales drops of 10% and profit drops of 43% this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>. This [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuation]] relies heavily on a "mega recovery" that has not yet materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>.
*   **Estee Lauder:** Faced operational issues, market challenges with Asian consumers, and margin pressure from inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:57">[00:54:57]</a>. Despite a significant drop, people continue to bet on a profit margin recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:18">[00:55:18]</a>.
*   **Luxury Brands (LVMH, Kering, Hermès):** These companies are under pressure due to a slowdown in Chinese consumption of luxury goods, associated with falling property and stock market values in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:12">[01:36:12]</a>. Chinese fiscal stimulus and interest rate cuts may reactivate consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:09">[01:37:09]</a>. LVMH trades at 20-22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:54">[01:36:54]</a>, while Hermès, being "more top" and luxurious, usually trades at 35-40 times earnings, currently around 53 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:16">[01:38:16]</a>.

### Technology and AI
*   **Nvidia:** Has fallen due to market drag, despite better-than-expected results and forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:42">[00:56:42]</a>. A key factor was the confirmation that Super Micro was exporting Nvidia chips to China via Singapore, which is prohibited, impacting 20-25% of Nvidia's sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>. The biggest risk for Nvidia is if major tech companies (Amazon, Google, Netflix, Facebook) stop seeing significant economic returns from their AI investments and halt chip purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:48">[00:57:48]</a>.
*   **AST SpaceMobile:** A company aiming to develop a satellite network for greater mobile coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:03">[01:29:03]</a>. It has seen a significant rise (from $2 to $30) as it is in the satellite network building phase and has secured initial contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:13">[01:29:13]</a>. This is a high-risk, high-reward investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:07">[01:30:07]</a>.
*   **Chinese Tech (BYD, Xiaomi, Pinduoduo/Temu):**
    *   **BYD:** A Chinese electric vehicle (EV) manufacturer experiencing "very strong growth" and trading at a PER of 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
    *   **Xiaomi:** Started as a smartphone manufacturer but has entered the EV market with "impressive" vehicles at "super competitive prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:43">[01:30:43]</a>. Xiaomi EVs have a two-year waiting list due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:56">[01:32:56]</a>.
    *   **Pinduoduo (PDD)/Temu:** The holding company behind Temu. Chinese companies like PDD and Alibaba are growing at 20-30% annually but still trade at low P/E ratios (e.g., PDD at 10, or 7 excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:46">[01:00:46]</a>. China's recent massive economic stimulus plan, including increased fiscal deficit and lower interest rates, may boost its economy and change market opinion on these stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:24">[01:01:24]</a>.
*   **Impinj (PI):** A cloud connectivity platform manufacturer of chips for the Internet of Things (IoT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:06">[01:44:06]</a>. It trades at 70 times earnings, implying significant future growth, but is expected to see a decrease this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:10">[01:44:10]</a>. It is a leader in its segment, manufacturing electronic labels and sensors for inventory management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:40">[01:46:40]</a>.
*   **Silergy Group (SG):** Another IoT component manufacturer, growing powerfully in recent years, with a normalized profit of about 60 million this year and 80 million next year, capitalizing at 600 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:27">[01:47:27]</a>. It trades at a PER of 20.

### Financial Sector
*   **American Express:** Has seen a slight decline due to recession fears and potential increases in delinquency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:54">[01:48:54]</a>. It trades at 17 times earnings, which is historically typical, but was recently higher compared to its 2018 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:04">[01:49:04]</a>.
*   **Spanish Banks (BBVA, Santander):** European banks have seen improved management, with a halt to share dilution and real dividend payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:36">[01:18:36]</a>. BBVA, for example, trades at 8 times earnings and is projected to have a significantly higher Return on Equity (ROE) of 15-18% in the coming years, compared to its historical average of 9-11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a>. This justifies trading above book value, potentially twice book value if ROE stabilizes at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>.

### Energy Sector
*   **YPF (IPF):** Argentina's state-owned oil company, trading at 3-4 times profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:44">[01:40:44]</a>. Oil companies have recently seen declines due to concerns about economic slowdown reducing oil demand and the possibility of increased OPEC production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:46">[01:38:46]</a>. YPF is considered interesting, with oil prices expected to remain above minimum extraction costs (around $60-65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:50">[01:40:50]</a>.
*   **Repsol (REP):** A Spanish oil company trading at 5 times earnings with a dividend yield of 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:35">[01:41:35]</a>. It is diversified, with refining and distribution businesses less sensitive to oil price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:46">[01:41:46]</a>. Repsol has significantly reduced its debt and is returning substantial capital to shareholders through buybacks and dividends (around 15% annual return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:26">[01:42:26]</a>. Historically, it trades at 10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:09">[01:42:09]</a>.

### Brokerage
*   **Robinhood:** Its performance is tied to the activity of "hot money" investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>. The recent falls in high-growth stocks like Tesla and Nvidia could mean lower income for Robinhood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. However, the NASDAQ's plan for 24/7 trading could benefit Robinhood, though this is not immediate, planned for late 2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:33">[01:20:33]</a>.

## Navigating the Current Market Environment
It is crucial not to sell in panic or buy out of excitement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:47">[01:51:47]</a>. While the market may experience corrections, predicting the exact moment of a collapse is difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. Selling everything is not a viable solution, as even top investors like Warren Buffett do not employ this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:06">[01:54:06]</a>.

### Key Strategies:
*   **Diversification:** Diversify your portfolio beyond just large-cap technology companies or popular stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:14">[02:14:14]</a>. Consider small-cap stocks, which are often cheaper, and special situations (e.g., arbitrage or control battles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:26">[02:21:26]</a>.
*   **Geographic Diversification:** Explore European, Canadian, and UK stocks, which currently offer attractive [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>. Chinese stocks, despite a recent bear market, also present opportunities with low P/E ratios (e.g., 8 to 10) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:08">[02:23:08]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overexposure:** Do not be overly exposed to very expensive stocks, segments, or sectors with potential bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:07">[02:28:07]</a>.
*   **Monitor Debt:** Avoid companies with high debt levels, as it amplifies downside risk during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:46">[02:46:46]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** Understand that all crises eventually pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:14">[02:29:14]</a>. Historical data shows that post-election years in the U.S. tend to be bullish, with the S&P 500 rising an average of 18% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:05">[02:13:05]</a>. Current corrections (around 7%) are normal within a bull market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

I suppose that here it will have the typical services because here I am seeing Inditex. Well, maybe when the inventory comes through the store they have sensors and that is already registered in the system to have an inventory control, eh. And well, here is the graph, I think that is what it implies. Okay, well, maybe it is the world's leading company that does this and it is a megatechnology that is going to be implemented in many eh stores and that could be interesting. Here I am seeing that it is also useful for inventory management and that each cash register is connected through the network and each tag or each electronic label that the company manufactures, eh, is integrated within the products. They do not give forecasts for this year either. I believe that Evita also fluctuates a little, maybe they are scaling products or releasing new versions. But well, in an interesting company, there is another similar one that I think is also a little cheaper, which is Sell Group, which also makes components for the Internet of Things to connect multiple applications with the Internet and it has also grown very powerful in recent years in fact you see here that years ago it billed 40 million and now this year it is expected to make 300 million it is an almost similar growth with a normalized profit this year of about 60 million and next year 80 and capitalizes 600 if this is not bad eh if this is not bad then it is quite interesting Ah well it is Bulgarian leb Ah ok it seemed very cheap to me lose 10 I say J well I'm going to buy it tomorrow Bulgarian left to Euro well it is this one it is at 50 okay so it is simply double so this in euros it is like this year it is going to earn eh 30 million and est 60 or it is a PER of 20 in a market similar to this other one of this company that you mention imping but with a similar growth and well this company also seems good, I mean it seems like a leader because of the clients it has and so on and a technology Well that supposedly has a lot of tailwind and it can and can benefit it American Express is good American Express has gone down a little because people are afraid of the recession and that the delinquency increases a little and unlike Visa or Mastercard American Express does extend credit but it is a very solvent credit and well it is per 17 which is what it usually is historically and so on and it is a little bit why it has dropped it was quite high multiples compared to the average of recent years and and you see here before which it does not make much sense because interest rates are higher than in 2018 and in 2018 it was per 13 and now it was per 20 so it is an example of these actions where people were paying slightly higher multiples but a very good company is going to continue growing and so on em and and app lobin we already talked about it about the risk it had in fact it has materialized or rather I do not want to say take credit here or anything but we were talking about the risk that the advertising technology companies or the ad advertising technology companies or the ad Tech that we were talking about in fact published results recently and it went back down from 300 well almost 500 which was at the level 300 and then it has continued to fall is a more reasonable multiple but the growth can evaporate overnight and I tell you this because I have lost money in some of these stocks I have also earned it in others but it is a very real risk and it can change not in the morning or in other words here discounting future growth of saying no This is growing today at 30 and I extrapolate that it will grow in 30 5 7 years is very difficult to do in other industries yes it is reasonable but in this one not so that is why high multiples It is rare that they are sustained for a long time and that is why the company also went down in agreement and Well I think that with that we are going to finish for today it is an interesting live uh I think it has a lot of information to navigate the current environment especially in the stock market you know that the only important asset is information being uh up to date to be a sophisticated investor who has enough tools in your Arsenal to be able to find opportunities in different places because there are always opportunities and most importantly with very little capital you can do things very different from what is done in a fund and have much higher returns Because I did it back in the day, thanks to that, I started to live off the stock market and with that I was able to found true value, which gave us the initial capital, which is no small thing to uh be able to start, and it's kind of the objective of the Channel to be an introduction for you to see and then for you to form an agreement. Today we're bringing the Red Polo, which is a little more tense in the market, but as I always say, it's important not to be stock market tourists, to know what you're doing and not to sell in panic, not to buy out of excitement because you say something is going up a lot and you don't care if it's at 100 times earnings, 200 because in recent weeks we've been seeing a bit of what's happening and the market will continue to rise in the long term, what we've seen is surely a. Well, a small bump in the road, and we'll see how the situation evolves, we'll be watching the live shows, so well, you can see a little more in real time how it's done as the data comes out and all this, okay, and nothing, I hope that above all you have good investments, even if things are not going well. coming out as you expect at the investment level, eh, the best thing is to lose money when you are starting to invest, not when you are at the end, but at the beginning. Well, if the markets go down, there are opportunities and so on, so you always have time to train yourself and to take advantage of those opportunities. And in the end, everything passes and time heals everything, including the markets. So, eh, nothing else, I hope you enjoyed it. See you next week and nothing else. Greetings and good investment, see you later. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:02">[00:59:02]</a>

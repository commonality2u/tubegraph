It is possible to live off the stock market and obtain a predictable and increasing income over time, though with certain nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Ways to Make Money from Stocks

There are two primary ways to generate income from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

1.  **Revaluation:** This involves buying a stock to sell it at a higher price in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. This method depends on other investors being willing to pay more for the stocks in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a> and often provides less predictable and more volatile results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Dividends:** This is a more predictable way to generate income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Certain companies periodically distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This method does not depend on future investors willing to pay more for shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>; instead, it relies on a correct analysis of the company's ability to generate stable and growing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Companies that pay stable and growing dividends, even through crises like 2000, 2008, and 2020, can provide predictable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Building a Diversified Dividend Portfolio

To achieve a consistent income objective, such as $100 or €100 per day (equivalent to $3,000/month or $36,000/year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>, a specific [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | investment strategy]] is recommended:

### Portfolio Composition and Diversification

*   **Sector Diversification:** Academic studies suggest investing in at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   **Number of Stocks:** An [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | investment portfolio]] should ideally contain between 15 and 20 stocks that meet specific profitability objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Focus on Dividends:** The primary focus should be on the company's capacity to generate profits and pay high dividends, rather than short-term stock market price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Reinvestment for Future Revaluation:** Companies typically reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business, which can lead to future revaluation in addition to dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### Target Dividend Yield

A realistic dividend yield objective for a portfolio is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   Lower yields (e.g., 3-4%) require significantly more capital to reach the income objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Higher yields (e.g., 10-12%) are often not stable or sustainable, especially during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>.
*   The ideal is to form a portfolio with an average dividend yield of around 7%, balancing stocks that pay slightly more (around 8%) with those that pay slightly less (around 6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### Calculating Required Capital

To determine the capital needed to achieve an income objective, use the following formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>:

`Required Capital = (Annual Income Target / Expected Portfolio Yield) * 1`

For example, to achieve $36,000 annually with a 7% average portfolio yield:
`Required Capital = ($36,000 / 0.07)`
`Required Capital = $504,000` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>

This calculation highlights that the required capital depends on the expected average daily performance and the portfolio's capacity to generate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. Increasing portfolio profitability or decreasing the daily performance expectation will reduce the capital needed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.

## Finding Dividend Stocks

Several free tools can help identify stocks that meet these dividend objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>:

### Investing.com Stock Screener

This website's "Stock Screener" tool allows users to search for stocks from specific countries that meet certain dividend profitability objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

*   **Dividend Yield Filter:** Set this between 6% and 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. Yields above 10% are often unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth Filter:** Limit the low range to 0% (avoiding companies that reduce dividends) and the top range to 10% average annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Aggressive dividend growth with high profitability is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.

Examples of companies found using this filter include a major telecommunications company with a 7% dividend, Las Vegas Sands, Iron Mountain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, Pixar Royalties, and a nursing home company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. These filters can be applied to various regions like Spain, Europe, Latin America, or Canada <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

### Other Useful Tools

*   **Seeking Alpha (S.A. Kim Alfa):** Useful for researching dividend stocks, specifically in the "dividends" section under "dividend growth" to see historical growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Market Screener:** In the "finance" section, this tool shows the expected dividend payment for the next two years, allowing monitoring for stability or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

Dividends are typically sent automatically to your broker account, either monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

### Taxation

*   **General Taxation:** In most countries, dividends are taxed between 20% and 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:25">[00:17:25]</a>.
*   **Withholding Tax (Double Payment):** When receiving dividends from outside your country of tax residence, a "withholding tax" can lead to double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>.
*   **W8BEN Form (USA):** For US stocks, filling out the W8BEN form, often provided by brokers like Interactive Brokers, can help avoid this double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.

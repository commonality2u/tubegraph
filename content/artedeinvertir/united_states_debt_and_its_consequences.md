According to renowned economist and investor Ray Dalio, the "new world order" will usher in an [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | economic recession]] without precedent due to three significant problems for which society is not prepared [00:00:04]. These challenges are considered the most important of our lives [00:00:17].

## Ray Dalio's Perspective

Ray Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund with over $100 trillion in assets under management, is a highly respected figure in financial markets known for navigating major economic crises like those in 2000 and 2008 [00:01:10]. His recent book, *The New World Order*, condenses his views on the serious economic changes ahead [00:01:48].

In a CNBC interview, Dalio outlined the three forces he believes are the greatest he has ever seen, historically leading to economic recessions, significant changes, the end of empires, and the decline of major world currencies [00:01:59].

## The Three Major Problems

### 1. Social Gap and Class Struggle
The first problem identified is a class struggle, or social gap, between "those who have and those who do not" [00:02:13]. This gap is widening, creating future tensions [00:02:27]. For instance, 1% of the American population increasingly owns more wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less [00:02:33]. Recent inflation has exacerbated this disparity, as the poorest 50% often lack assets like stocks or real estate that protect against inflation [00:02:43].

### 2. Enormous Debt Bubble
The second major problem is the immense debt held by both the United States and Europe [00:03:16]. Dalio notes a decreasing demand for United States debt, considering American bonds a "very risky investment" [00:03:22].

To address this debt, Dalio suggests two potential outcomes:
*   Interest rates for the debt will have to rise [00:03:29].
*   The state will have to print more money [00:03:32].

The latter solution, printing more money to solve recessions, is problematic as it generates higher inflation, which further increases the social gap between classes [00:03:40]. This "debt bubble" is one of the key factors contributing to a predicted [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | totally different world]] in five years [00:03:59].

### 3. The Rise of China and US Decline
The third problem is the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | rise of China]] and the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | impending decline of the United States]] [00:04:35]. This shift is expected to significantly affect the value of the dollar and its status as a global reserve currency [00:04:41]. For the past 70 years, the U.S. has dominated the international political landscape, controlling institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, but this is about to change [00:04:46].

Dalio's analysis suggests the United States is entering a "decline phase" marked by high debt levels, social struggles, and currency devaluation [00:05:01]. Conversely, China is seen in an "ascending phase" of wealth creation and debt accumulation [00:05:10].

## Protecting Investments in a Complex Environment

Given this outlook, Dalio provides recommendations for small investors to navigate this complex environment:

*   **Invest Globally:** Investors should view their investments from a global perspective [00:05:25].
*   **Combat Inflation through Investment:** The primary way to prevent money from losing value due to inflation is to invest [00:05:29]. The value of assets like stocks and gold has risen due to the creation of new debt and money [00:05:33].
*   **Avoid Liquidity and Fixed Income:** Dalio advises against investments traditionally considered safe, such as liquidity and fixed income, as their value typically decreases in inflationary scenarios [00:05:43].
*   **Favor Real Assets:** Real assets, for which there is constant demand (e.g., stocks, real estate, gold), are expected to perform much better relatively in this new economic scenario [00:06:10].
*   **Diversify Wisely:** In a world of uncertainty and risks, it is crucial to learn to diversify without lowering performance expectations. Effective diversification can reduce risk by up to 80% [00:06:21]. Dalio generally recommends investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks [00:06:35]. He popularized the "four seasons" portfolio management theory for this purpose [00:06:40].

### Ray Dalio's Current Investment Strategy
While Dalio typically holds a significant portion of his portfolio in debt or long-term bonds, his current main positions are observed in stocks [00:07:35]. His preferred sector for investment right now is technology, with holdings in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa [00:06:57].

Conversely, Dalio has been selling positions in the banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, as these sectors are highly sensitive to the economic cycle, and he likely seeks to avoid potential future problems [00:07:07].

Another sector Dalio favors for this environment is stable or defensive consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi [00:07:45]. He has also invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF (IWM), which tracks 2,000 small-cap U.S. companies [00:08:21]. Historically, these small-cap stocks tend to perform better than the market average and large companies when interest rates drop and liquidity increases in the system [00:08:37].

Dr. Michael Burry is a renowned investor who gained significant fame for being one of the first to predict the 2008 crisis, making a substantial personal fortune in the process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His story was popularized by the Brad Pitt-produced film *The Big Short*, which was nominated for five Oscars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Early Career and Scion Capital

Despite being a doctor by profession, Michael Burry combined his medical work with his passion for the stock market in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. He actively published his investment ideas and results on internet forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Impressed by his success, investors offered him a million dollars to start his own fund, leading to the creation of Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Scion Capital delivered impressive results from the start. In its first year, it generated an 8% return while the S&P 500 fell 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The second year saw a 55% return against an 11% S&P 500 decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, and the third year yielded 16% in 2002 while the S&P fell 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Due to these strong returns, Scion Capital quickly attracted more capital, managing over $500 million for clients in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

In 2006, as depicted in *The Big Short*, [[michael_burrys_investment_style_and_achievements | Michael Burry's investment style]] shifted dramatically from buying stocks to betting his entire fund against the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. This daring bet proved immensely profitable, yielding a 160% return in 2007 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. His investors gained over $700 million, and his personal fortune exceeded $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>. Scion Capital achieved an accumulated return of 700% annually for its clients, making it one of the most successful funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Investment Strategies and Advice

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry's investment strategy]] is guided by principles he shared in his early years on forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. His advice includes:

### Buying Ignored Companies
> My [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and portfolio changes | investment strategy]] is not very complex: I try to buy shares in ignored companies when it seems that they are going to go bankrupt, and I sell them when they have improved slightly. The management of my portfolio is so important like company selection. If I can do both well, I will be successful. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>

This advice explains his strong preference for the retail and energy sectors, which are currently out of fashion, abound with cheap companies, and could see significant regularization if fears subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

### Concentrated Portfolio
> I like to have between 12 and 18 stocks in my portfolio, depressed industries. I tend to always be invested this number of positions, I feel it gives me room to have my best ideas while smoothing out volatility so as not to confuse portfolio volatility with portfolio risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>

Burry prefers a concentrated portfolio, generally holding under 25 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This approach aligns with other great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, who favor concentrating their investments in their highest conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Investing in Good Quality Companies
> I'm also delighted to add to the portfolio the companies that Warren Buffett likes with a competitive advantage, high return on capital if the market offers them at good prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>

This highlights his flexibility; while he seeks out-of-favor companies, he is also willing to invest in popular, high-quality companies with competitive advantages like Google, if they are trading at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.

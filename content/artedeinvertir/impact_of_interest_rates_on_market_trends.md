Interest rates play a crucial role in influencing stock market trends, often considered the most important factor, even more so than political events or trade wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:27">[01:12:27]</a>. The behavior of central banks and the Federal Reserve, along with capital flows, significantly impacts these rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:51">[01:12:51]</a>.

## The 10-Year US Bond as a Benchmark

The 10-year US bond is widely regarded as the safest asset globally and serves as the benchmark against which almost any investment is compared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:43">[01:11:43]</a>.

### Impact of Bond Yield Changes
*   **Rising Bond Yields**
    When bond yields increase, such as the 10-year US bond yield tripling from 0.5% to 1.6% in a few months, it puts downward pressure on stock prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:46">[01:11:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. This is because if bonds offer higher profitability, other investments must also offer more, which typically necessitates a drop in their market price first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:06">[01:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:09">[01:12:09]</a>. This adjustment particularly affects growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:51">[01:11:51]</a>.
*   **Falling Bond Yields**
    Conversely, when bond yields decrease, as seen between January/February of the previous year and the summer of 2017 (after the coronavirus outbreak when everything was cheap), stock prices tend to rise rapidly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:14">[01:12:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:22">[01:12:22]</a>.

## Equity Risk Premium

The "equity risk premium" measures the profitability offered by the S&P 500 when compared to the profitability of the 10-year US bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:55">[01:12:55]</a>.
*   If the S&P 500's profitability is **above** the bond's, it indicates that stocks are cheap relative to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:09">[01:13:09]</a>.
*   Historically, in 2000, when stocks were "hyper expensive" (the S&P 500 was below the bond's profitability), the S&P fell by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:16">[01:13:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:20">[01:13:20]</a>.
*   Conversely, in periods like 2011 or 2009, when stocks were very cheap relative to bonds, the S&P quadrupled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:32">[01:13:32]</a>.
*   During the March 2020 market downturn, fear was widespread, but solid businesses offered a much better return than bonds, leading to a rapid recovery in the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:34">[01:13:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:53">[01:13:53]</a>.
*   Currently, shares are at an attractive price, though less so than in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:03">[01:14:03]</a>. If bond yields continue to rise, stocks will become less attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:06">[01:14:06]</a>.

## Inflation and Interest Rates

Interest rates are highly correlated with inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:34">[01:14:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:36">[01:14:36]</a>. The market anticipates inflation when there is a high money supply (M2) and a strong desire from people to spend, particularly after periods of limited consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:11">[01:15:11]</a>. Key indicators for expected inflation include:
*   The rising 10-year US bond yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
*   Raw materials reaching multi-year highs (e.g., copper, oil, aluminum, uranium) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:20">[01:16:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:24">[01:16:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:33">[01:16:33]</a>.

If inflation materializes, central banks will be compelled to raise interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

### Market Behavior with Rising Interest Rates
Historically, rising interest rates or bond yields do not always lead to stock market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>.
*   When interest rates rise, **value stocks** (more traditional, stable companies generating significant cash flow) tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:15">[01:20:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:17">[01:20:17]</a>. This is beneficial in an inflationary environment as receiving current income helps preserve purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   Conversely, high-growth technology stocks, which promise cash flow far into the future, tend to perform poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:33">[01:17:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:48">[01:17:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:20">[01:20:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:22">[01:20:22]</a>.

In such scenarios, the market often compensates, with the positive performance of value stocks offsetting declines in growth stocks, potentially leading to an overall positive or sideways market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:23">[01:20:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:25">[01:20:25]</a>.

## Gold and Inflation Expectations

Gold's price behavior is highly correlated with inflation expectations and bond yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:17">[02:21:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:21">[02:21:21]</a>. When the market expects inflation (indicated by rising yields of inflation-protected bonds like TIPS), gold typically rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:04">[02:22:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:08">[02:22:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:10">[02:22:10]</a>. However, it's not always a defensive asset, as it can fall when the stock market goes down if deflation is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:24">[02:22:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:27">[02:22:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:29">[02:22:29]</a>. A recent divergence has been observed where gold has corrected while inflation expectations and raw material prices have soared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:35">[02:23:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:43">[02:23:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:45">[02:23:45]</a>.

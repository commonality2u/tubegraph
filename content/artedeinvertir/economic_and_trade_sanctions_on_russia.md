The ongoing [[economic_impact_of_the_ukraine_occupation | conflict between Russia and Ukraine]] has led to significant economic and trade sanctions imposed on Russia by Western countries, impacting global markets and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. These measures are designed to limit Russia's ability to trade and finance itself, but they also have broader [[Impacts of Ukraine Invasion on Global Economy | economic impacts]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Key Sanctions Imposed

### Energy Sector Restrictions
One of the immediate responses from Europe was Germany's decision to suspend the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This pipeline was intended to bring Russian gas directly to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This suspension, coupled with existing supply crises and inflation, caused [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | gas prices]] in Europe to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, worsening the situation for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Similarly, [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | oil prices]] have also surged, nearing $100 per barrel, compared to $50 a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

### Exclusion from SWIFT
Western countries have also threatened to exclude Russia from the [[implications_of_swift_sanctions_on_russia | SWIFT system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. This would severely limit Russia's ability to make international payments in currencies like euros, pounds, and especially dollars, thereby greatly restricting [[impact_of_tariff_crisis_on_global_economy | trade]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. While Russia would be the primary victim, such obstacles to [[impact_of_tariff_crisis_on_global_economy | global trade]] are detrimental to all, as many Western companies derive a significant portion of their sales from the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Economic Impacts and Consequences

### Energy Market Volatility
Russia is a major global producer of oil, accounting for 10% of daily global consumption (10 million out of 100 million barrels) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Historically, even a small deficit in oil production (2-4 million barrels) can cause disproportionate price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. For example, in 2008, oil prices jumped from $100 to $150 in weeks due to similar pressures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. If sanctions prevent Russia from trading its oil, it would create a worldwide bottleneck, leading to serious price implications that affect global [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | energy costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While oil-producing companies might benefit, the rest of the world would be negatively impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.

Natural gas prices in Europe have also tripled over the last year, reaching 60-70 euros per megawatt compared to 20 euros a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Although Germany believes Europe has a secure gas supply, the cost remains a significant concern for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Gas exports from Russia to Europe were already low in 2021 due to prior tensions, which contributed to the aggravated situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Agriculture and Food Industry
The conflict threatens the agriculture and food industry, which impacts nearly everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Food prices were already rising due to inflation, and this conflict exacerbates the issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Russia is a major global producer of grains and wheat, ranking fourth worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Including Ukraine, these two countries account for approximately 20% of global grain production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Sanctions on Russia and disruptions in Ukraine could significantly reduce this supply, leading to disproportionate price increases (50-100%) in commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Food commodity price indices have recently surged to 500, far above the historical average of 200-250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### Fertilizer Market
Russia and Ukraine are also significant producers of fertilizers, particularly potassium, a key chemical component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Russia contributes almost 20% of global potassium production, alongside Belarus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Fertilizer prices are already critically high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, and this directly impacts food production and drives inflation higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

## Impact on Financial Markets
The [[impact of the Ukraine conflict on the financial markets | Russian stock index]] has collapsed by 40% from its highs, a more severe fall than during the 2008 crisis or the 2020 confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Other [[impact_of_russiaukraine_conflict_on_global_stock_markets | stock markets]] have also seen declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

Historically, [[impact_of_russiaukraine_conflict_on_global_stock_markets | stock markets]] tend to fall before major conflicts due to uncertainty, but then recover when the "negative events occur" and people realize it's "not the end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>. For example, the invasion of Iraq in 1990 saw a significant fall but recovered within 180 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:00">[11:17:00]</a>.

### Investment Styles and War
During conflicts, investments in small and large companies historically show higher returns compared to their annual averages, as assets become cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>. Conversely, "safer" investments like bonds tend to yield less return during conflicts because investors flock to them, driving up their prices and lowering their yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:23:00">[14:23:00]</a>. This means opportunities for higher returns often emerge during periods of fear and market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:52:00">[14:52:00]</a>.

### Cyclical Stocks
The conflict particularly impacts cyclical stocks in sectors like oil, gas, banking, raw materials, airlines, and carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:05:00">[20:05:00]</a>. While companies like Gazprom (Russian gas and oil producer) might seem to benefit from high energy prices, sanctions could severely limit their trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:43:00">[17:43:00]</a>. Cyclical stocks are best bought when their Price/Earnings (P/E) valuation is highest (meaning raw material prices are lowest), as this is when future results are expected to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:00">[20:59:00]</a>. These stocks are often seen as "good for renting, not for investing" long-term, meaning they are more suitable for short-term speculation rather than long-term ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:36:00">[24:36:00]</a>.

### Technology Stocks
The market overall, especially technology stocks, has experienced significant drops, with the Nasdaq falling 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:15:00">[29:15:00]</a>. This is partly due to a shift from market "euphoria" to "fear," leading to a sell-off in perceived "risky assets" like cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:44:00">[30:44:00]</a>, which are not considered a protection against inflation or market crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:37:00">[30:37:00]</a>. Technology sector is currently "underweight" by investment fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:09:00">[32:09:00]</a>.

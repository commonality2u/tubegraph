[[Warren Buffetts latest investment moves | Warren Buffett]], often called the "Oracle of Omaha" for his predictive abilities in economic and investment events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>, is reportedly preparing for a financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For the first time in a long while, [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Buffett]] has broken his silence to issue an important warning to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He is taking drastic measures by rapidly selling stocks to build a cash cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>.

## Historical Precedent for Warnings

Historically, [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Buffett]] has rarely issued such messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. The two previous times he issued this kind of warning, both the stock market and the economy suffered significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. The current period marks his third warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

On both past occasions when [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Buffett]] took measures like rapidly selling shares and sending caution messages, the market fell more than 40% and the economy experienced a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>.

### First Warning (Early Career)
The first instance was at the beginning of his career, managing investment funds called partnerships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. After 13 successful years with annual returns exceeding 30%, he declared that the economy faced significant challenges and stock market valuations were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Despite widespread belief that the market and economy would continue to rise, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Buffett]] accumulated cash and eventually returned all money to his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Shortly after these measures, the stock market fell 20%, accumulating declines of nearly 50% over four years, and the economy entered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Second Warning (1999)
In 1999, 30 years after his initial warning, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Buffett]] took similar measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. He warned of "enormous euphoria" in the stock market, unsustainable valuations, and a challenging economic environment ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>. Six months after this warning, the internet bubble burst, major stock markets plummeted over 45%, the Nasdaq fell over 75%, and US and European economies entered a recession 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Current Actions and Outlook

[[Warren Buffetts latest investment moves | Buffett's]] current actions include accumulating significant liquidity. Berkshire Hathaway, his holding company, now holds over $300 billion in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This amount is so large that [[Warren Buffetts latest investment moves | Buffett]] could buy 100% of companies like Netflix, Starbucks, McDonald's, or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is currently the most liquid and cash-rich company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.

### Stock Sales
[[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Buffett's]] recent sales have focused on reducing exposure to the financial and banking sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Notable sales include historic holdings like Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. While these companies are not highly valued, they are sensitive to a potential economic recession, which aligns with [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Buffett's]] cautious view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Sectors most affected by a crisis typically include financial, real estate, technology, and industrial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Buffett]] has reduced positions in technology (except Apple, where he had huge profits and significantly reduced this position) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, sold off real estate companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, and no longer holds companies in the industrial sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. He was reportedly looking for a buyer for his real estate agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

### Stock Acquisitions
In contrast, the energy sector is considered one of the least affected in a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. In recent months, [[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Buffett]] has expanded positions in the energy sector, purchasing shares in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

### Reasons for Caution
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Buffett's]] caution stems from several factors:
*   **Global Events**: In a recent conference, [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Buffett]] stated he is "comfortable increasing [his] cash and liquidity position" due to "everything that is happening in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This refers to current tariff problems, conflicts between China and the United States, speculation in financial markets, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   **High Valuations**: He also noted that investing in the stock market is "not an attractive option" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a> because current valuations for most stocks are very high relative to the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He prefers to keep his money in liquidity, earning 5% while waiting for better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   Historically, the stock market trades at an average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. Currently, it is trading at 20 times earnings, which [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Buffett]] believes makes it expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.
    *   A JP Morgan study suggests that the expected return for the S&P 500 over the next 10 years is very low, possibly below 5% or even 0% annually, due to high valuations (19 to 22 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.
    *   In a letter to investors, [[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Buffett]] expressed hope to use liquidity to buy high-quality companies, but currently, "the prices of businesses with good long-term characteristics are sky-high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Investment Tips | Warren Buffett's Advice for Small Investors]]

When asked what he would do as a small investor with a small amount of money in the current environment of high stock market valuations, [[Warren Buffetts Investment Tips | Buffett]] responded, "I would probably focus on smaller companies where there's a greater chance of finding a good investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. He added, "If I had less than a million dollars today, I would be fully invested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

This advice highlights a key aspect of [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Buffett's]] own success:
*   **Focus on Lesser-Known Companies**: He recommends investing in lesser-known companies where finding a "cheap" company is much easier, even in an overall expensive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   **Indexing vs. Stock Picking**: While indexing (investing in famous companies like the S&P 500) has yielded strong results and is a valid long-term strategy for the general population, [[Warren Buffetts Investment Tips | Buffett]] believes future performance will be much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. He suggests that a complementary strategy could be to select your own investments for greater control and appreciation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Buffett]] built his fortune by selecting investments in lesser-known companies with greater appreciation potential and attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Investment Universe**: [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Buffett]] states that with his enormous wealth, he can only invest in about 50 companies out of over 40,000 listed worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. For a private investor, opportunities are still abundant in lesser-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Small-cap valuations are currently the most undervalued and attractive segment of the stock market, trading at just 12 times earnings, representing almost a 40% discount compared to larger indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Eurostock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

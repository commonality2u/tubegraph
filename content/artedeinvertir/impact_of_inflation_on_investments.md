## Current Economic Outlook

The economy is currently experiencing a "classic witch fueled by easy money" from the Federal Reserve, which involved printing large amounts of money and quantitative easing measures. However, a shift is occurring with interest rates now being raised, creating opposing forces in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This environment is leading to bubble situations in the economy, particularly in stock markets and specific shares, and the rise in prices is a dominant force <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Central banks are accelerating processes, with expectations of up to three interest rate increases this year, a change from earlier forecasts of one or two increases by the end of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Consequences of Easy Money and Inflation

The prior period of easy money and low interest rates historically favored speculative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:53">[00:12:53]</a>. Money printing has caused speculative bubbles in various assets, including electric vehicles, SPACs, renewable energy companies, cloud software companies, and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. These assets saw "crazy achievements" in the past year, with some multiplying by 13 to 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

However, as economic conditions harden and [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] appears, these investments tend to reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. When [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] becomes a factor, investors quickly shift focus to assets that generate immediate cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. If investments do not generate current cash flow, their value depreciates by the [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

The lack of investment in raw materials, oil, and gas, due to the focus on clean energy, has led to potential permanent effects on prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. The infrastructure plan, involving nearly $2 trillion, will require significant amounts of cement, steel, and copper, further increasing demand while supply decreases due to underinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategies During Inflation

Bill Ackman, a notable investor, emphasized preparing investment portfolios for an [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. His strategy involves protecting investments against rising interest rates and [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

### Bill Ackman's Approach

Ackman's approach, similar to Warren Buffett's recommendations, focuses on owning predictable and resilient companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. These businesses are easy to understand and can withstand economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>. The key characteristic of these businesses is their "pricing power"â€”the ability to raise prices without losing customers when costs rise due to [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>.

Examples of such businesses include:
*   **Domino's Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill:** People continue to consume these products regardless of economic conditions, making them predictable and resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>. They can raise menu prices if food costs increase, as demonstrated by McDonald's performance during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.
*   **Nike:** This company consistently raises prices by about 5% annually. If inflation increases its costs by 2-3%, the 1-2% differential goes directly to profit, illustrating operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.
*   **Louis Vuitton and other luxury products:** These businesses benefit from an increasing middle class willing to pay more for their products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>.
*   **McDonald's:** During the 2008 crisis, McDonald's sales only dropped slightly by 3%, and its gross margins actually expanded from 38% to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:45">[00:33:45]</a>. This is because they primarily charge royalties and rents, which increase with [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
*   **Lowe's Companies (home improvement retailers):** During the 2008 real estate crisis, Lowe's sales only decreased by 2%, despite a 70% plummet in US housing construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:21">[01:10:21]</a>. This indicates that most of their sales are recurring, driven by home maintenance and renewals rather than new construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.
*   **Adobe:** This software company, despite a 25% fall from its peak, is considered high-quality and resilient to crises. Its products, like PDF editor, are essential for many users, allowing Adobe to raise prices without significant customer loss, similar to Netflix and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

### Investing in Quality Businesses
The key is to buy quality businesses with pricing power at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. Warren Buffett's investment in See's Candies in 1972 is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:45">[00:41:45]</a>. See's Candies has a strong brand, predictable demand (often purchased for gifts), and low R&D costs, allowing it to raise prices over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:08">[00:43:08]</a>. Buffett's $25 million investment yielded nearly $2 billion in pre-tax profits, demonstrating the power of such businesses over the long term, even through periods of [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:13">[00:46:13]</a>.

In contrast, businesses that lack a unique product or service, such as general automobile companies like General Motors, struggle with pricing power due to intense competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:15">[00:32:15]</a>. Cyclical businesses like steel manufacturers (e.g., ArcelorMittal) are also highly sensitive to economic downturns, with sales plummeting during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

### Portfolio Management and Long-Term View
A diversified portfolio of 6-20 different shares is recommended to mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:05">[01:07:05]</a>. It's crucial to understand a business's fundamentals, its resilience to crises, and its pricing power. This involves analyzing historical financial data, stock market behavior over 10-15 years (not just 1-2 years), and customer reaction to price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:08">[02:08:08]</a>.

Investors should focus on the business's long-term value generation rather than short-term stock market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:08">[01:25:08]</a>. The stock market behaves like a pendulum, swinging between euphoria and pessimism, and investors should expect volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:41">[01:11:41]</a>. The goal is to generate a good rate of return (ideally double-digit) over the long term with a low risk profile and a high level of certainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

It's important to differentiate between growth companies (like Chipotle) and more stable companies (like Procter & Gamble or Nike), as they are valued differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:56">[01:02:56]</a>. Companies with higher growth potential often trade at higher multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:57">[01:03:57]</a>.

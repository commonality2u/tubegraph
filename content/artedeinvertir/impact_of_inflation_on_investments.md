The global economy is entering a "new world economic order," as warned by renowned investor Ray Dalio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This significant economic and social reform is expected to have serious implications for both the stock market and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, potentially leading to a major crisis in the U.S. and worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Perspective on the Economic Shift
Ray Dalio, often described as the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the reliability of his predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, manages $100 billion at his company Bridgewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He notes that a "great cycle" began a new world order in 1945 after World War II, establishing the dollar as a world reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This dominant power led to a period of peace and prosperity, but this is now changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Political extremism in the U.S. is expected to accelerate this process towards a new economic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

### The Decline of Dominant Economies
Through historical study, Ray Dalio has identified that every dominant economy, like the U.S. for the past 70 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, experiences phases of economic rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The U.S. is currently entering a phase of decline, characterized by:
*   High levels of debt in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Printing of money in alarming quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Leading to economic and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

In contrast, China is currently in its upward phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## The Impact of Inflation on Investments
This shift has [[inflation_impact_on_investment_portfolios | serious implications for all kinds of investments]], including real estate, stock market, commodities, and currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Ray Dalio warns that the current money printing tends to affect the middle and lower classes more severely, as they often lack savings or [[inflation_impact_on_investment_portfolios | financial investments]] to protect them from this new [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflationary environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve has printed record amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Its balance sheet grew from $1 trillion to over $7 trillion, a growth far exceeding the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. This "economic experiment" is already resulting in:
*   Levels of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation not seen for decades]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   Significant increases in the price of raw materials, products, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

The "helicopter money theory" — printing vast amounts of money and distributing it to stimulate consumption — was implemented in 2020 with $1,200 checks sent to American citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, Dalio points out that if printing money were the solution, countries like Zimbabwe would be the richest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Historically, this economic recipe has led to ruin in countries like Germany, Argentina, Venezuela, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Consequences of Economic Inequality and Inflation
Another critical issue highlighted by Ray Dalio is the extreme level of economic inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For instance, three individuals like Jeff Bezos accumulate more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Historically, such social inequality leads to three serious economic problems that will [[effects_of_inflation_on_investment_returns | affect our savings and investments]]:

1.  **Rising Taxes**: Taxes are expected to rise globally, as seen with Joe Biden's proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This negatively [[impact_of_inflation_on_the_market | affects the stock market]] by decreasing company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions**: The Federal Reserve has warned of future interest rate increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This would have a negative effect, especially on highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. This is part of the [[impact_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_investments | impact of inflation and interest rates on investments]].
3.  **Increased Regulations**: New regulations and measures to redistribute wealth would negatively [[the_impact_of_inflation_on_different_asset_classes | affect almost any kind of investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Investment Strategies During Inflation
In this economic environment, the worst strategy is to sell everything and hold cash, because in an [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investments | inflation scenario]], the value of money decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Therefore, it's crucial to remain invested in the correct assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Ray Dalio's investment philosophy emphasizes a portfolio that performs well in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. He recommends having at least 40% of an investment portfolio in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

### Specific Investment Opportunities During Inflation
A study by Bank of America covering 50 years of the stock market reveals which [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | investments perform best in a rising inflation scenario]]:

*   **Energy Sector**: This is by far the best-performing sector when inflation is expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)**: One of Canada's largest oil and energy producers, listed on the U.S. stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. It produces over a million barrels of oil daily from high-quality lands with low extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Despite sideways performance due to low inflation, its valuation is attractive (4 times EBITDA compared to a historical average of 6 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>. The company has an excellent track record of increasing dividends for 20 years, including during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. If Dalio's scenario materializes, its profits and valuation multiples could significantly increase, potentially valuing it above $100 per share from its current $32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials Sector**: This sector follows energy in performance during rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Ray Dalio affirms that gold will always perform well if this new world order materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, recommending at least 10% of a portfolio in gold or related investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   Money printing decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth towards financial assets, historically raising the price of gold and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Since March 2020, gold has risen from $1,500 to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   **Investing in Gold**:
        *   **Gold ETFs**: The easiest way is to buy an ETF that reflects gold's performance, such as the largest, GLD (ticker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, or European versions like iShares (ticker GN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
        *   **Gold Mining Companies**: This is more complex due to operational risks (floods, landslides, strikes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, if they perform well and gold prices rise, these investments can increase much more than gold itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. To reduce individual company risk, one can invest in gold mining ETFs, such as GDX (ticker) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
*   **Personal Defense Products**: Ray Dalio's biggest concern is government bankruptcy following economic shocks, leading to severe economic inequalities and class differences, which historically indicates wars and revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.
    *   **Axon Enterprise (AXON)**: This company, which manufactures personal defense products, would perform well in such a scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Since 2008, its shares have appreciated significantly (from $6 to over $75) due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. It trades at an attractive valuation (11 times this year's earnings vs. a historical average of 16 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. In Dalio's proposed scenario, its potential could be several times its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

The United States is facing a new economic scenario that is expected to affect everyone equally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The clock has begun to count down, and an economic disaster may be approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Janet Yellen, the current director of the American Treasury, has stated that this situation could lead to the [[potential_collapse_of_the_us_financial_system | total collapse of the financial system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. She warned that if a solution is not found in the coming weeks, it would cause irreversible damage to the American economy and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Janet Yellen's Warnings

Janet Yellen, formerly the chairwoman of the Federal Reserve and currently the director of the American Treasury, manages an entity that handles over four trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Her deep knowledge of the economy and financial markets makes her opinion on this new risk critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

In an interview with CNBC, Yellen described the periodic creation of "self-manufactured crises" by putting an arbitrary debt ceiling at risk of the financial and economic system's stability as "tremendously irresponsible," especially during a recovery from a deep crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

### Initial Measures and Outlook

Given that the United States is at its debt issuance limit, Janet Yellen has initiated "desperate measures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These include significant cuts to investments in pension and health plans, as well as suspending government investments for employee retirement plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. These measures represent a spending cut of over 200 billion U.S. dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

Yellen communicated to Congress that "extraordinary measures" are being taken to prevent the United States from going bankrupt once the debt limit is reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. She noted that these measures only provide "limited time to maneuver" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. She explicitly warned that these measures are likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>, indicating that a collapse of American debt could be just weeks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Understanding the US Debt Problem

The problem stems from the United States, like most countries, consistently spending more money than it earns, known as a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. To finance this deficit, new debt is issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Many years ago, a debt ceiling was established, which the U.S. is now about to reach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## Market Reactions: Credit Default Swaps (CDS)

[[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | Financial markets]] are already pricing in a potential bankruptcy of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDS) are insurance policies against government debt default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. The higher the risk, the higher the price for these insurance policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

According to a White House report, the price to insure American government debt has multiplied by more than nine times, indicating an [[risk_of_us_debt_default_and_market_reactions | enormous risk]] that the United States will default on its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>.

## Global Impact of US Debt Default

A default on U.S. debt would be akin to "gravity ceasing to exist," leading to total chaos and a [[potential_collapse_of_the_us_financial_system | financial collapse]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is because the entire global financial system is interconnected with American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. U.S. debt bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

The total American debt has grown exponentially to a current figure of $30 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. As investor Ray Dalio explains, one country's debt is another person's asset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Millions of entities and individuals worldwide hold massive amounts of these Treasury bills and bonds, as they were long considered the safest investment globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect on banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans that have invested huge sums in U.S. debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Such a scenario would be similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but "multiplied by 30 times," given the U.S. debt balance is 30 times higher than Lehman Brothers' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Investment Implications

In the event of a U.S. debt default:
*   The value of dollar bonds and fixed income would collapse due to loss of investor confidence and massive capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   The value of stocks and equity investments would also fall sharply, with a few exceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   The price of gold would likely rise sharply, as its price is measured against the U.S. dollar, providing a safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.

The White House published a report detailing possible consequences:
*   More than 2 million jobs lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   An additional annual cost of over 750 billion dollars in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   The dollar and the stock market would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions and Their Risks

The most viable solution would be an agreement between Republicans and Democrats, but political dynamics hinder this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Given the impasse, desperate solutions are being proposed.

### The Trillion-Dollar Platinum Coin

One proposed solution, described as "comical" yet real, is to mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This possibility is being considered by the American Treasury to temporarily solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

This solution is possible due to a legal loophole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. While the Federal Reserve is the only entity that can print money out of thin air digitally (which it did during the 2020 crisis to buy government debt), American law allows the Treasury to mint an unlimited number of physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The idea is to create these extraordinary trillion-dollar coins, deposit them with the Federal Reserve, and allow the government to use them as a checking account to continue paying expenses and debt interest without going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

This solution, while potentially working in the short term, would not send a message of stability to financial markets, as it is seen as an unserious way to manage the world's richest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. In this scenario, the value of the dollar, bonds, and stocks would continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Protecting Investments

In the face of this [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | new risk]], many investors are considering measures to protect their portfolios:
*   **Betting against US debt/stock market**: Some investors are adopting measures to bet against the US government debt and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. The government itself estimates that falls could be historic <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Gold would benefit in this scenario, as mentioned earlier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Stocks related to the gold sector, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS)**: Large investors like Ray Dalio, who have access to sophisticated products, could buy CDS to protect themselves from default risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs**: Inverse ETFs (Exchange-Traded Funds) are designed to go up in value when the market goes down, typically by holding investments in derivatives that bet against the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. An example is the ProShares Short S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>. However, these instruments have historically performed poorly in the long term because the stock market tends to revalue over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. They are usually used tactically for short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## White House Stock Market Predictions

A report commissioned by the White House to quantify the effects of a debt default estimates that the [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stock market]] could fall by up to 45% if a solution is not reached in time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>. This debt limit scenario was previously reached in 2011 and 2013, leading to high market volatility despite temporary solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

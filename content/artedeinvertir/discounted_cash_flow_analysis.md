[[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | Valuing a stock]] or an investment is a core topic in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. To succeed in finance and investment, one should aim to pay less than an asset's perceived worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The challenge lies in accurately calculating an asset's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Intrinsic Value and Valuation
The academically defined [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] of an asset is a broad concept <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. For a stock like Microsoft, an image might show different lines representing the stock price (in red) and the [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]], which can be calculated using various methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. The goal is to buy a stock when its price is below its estimated [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. A larger difference between price and [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] typically leads to a greater potential return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. With effective [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]], the market tends to correct itself within one or two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. However, many investors lack the patience for this time horizon, which can lead to suboptimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) Defined
The academic definition of [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] relies on Discounted Cash Flows (DCF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This method involves discounting the cash flows a company is expected to earn throughout its life at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

### DCF Formula
The formula for Discounted Cash Flows is as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>:

CF₁/(1+R)¹ + CF₂/(1+R)² + ... + CFₙ/(1+R)ⁿ

Where:
*   **CF** = Cash flow the company produces in a given period (e.g., Year 1, Year 2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>
*   **R** = The discount rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>
*   **N** = The number of periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>

The formula is structured so that cash flows further out in time have less weight in the final calculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Limitations of DCF
[[analyzing_stock_market_investments | Investing]] is considered more of an art than a science, making it difficult to predict a company's earnings 10 or 15 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. A significant problem with the DCF method is that the profits from the first five years of a company's operations have a very small impact on the final [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. For example, if a share trades at 30 euros, the next five years of profits might only account for 10-20% of that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. While academically sound, this method often lacks practical application in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

Due to the unreliability of the DCF method, [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] by multiples is often preferred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This approach involves predicting a business's earnings over a shorter, more visible period (e.g., 3-5 years) and updating the [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

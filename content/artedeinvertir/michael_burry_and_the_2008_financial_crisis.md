Michael Burry is recognized as a notable investor who accumulated a significant personal fortune by being one of the first to foresee the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Rise to Fame

Dr. Michael Burry gained widespread recognition through the movie "The Big Short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This film, produced by Brad Pitt, features Christian Bale in the role of Michael Burry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. "The Big Short" received five Oscar nominations and is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Background

Before his financial career, Michael Burry was a doctor by profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. He started combining his passion for the stock market with his medical work in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He was very active on internet forums and blogs, where he published his [[investment_strategies_and_advice_from_michael_burry | investment ideas]] and demonstrated positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Some investors offered him a million dollars to establish his [[michael_burrys_current_investment_portfolio | investment fund]], leading to the creation of Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>.

Scion Capital quickly achieved impressive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. In its first five years, the fund invested almost exclusively in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

*   **Year 1**: Generated an 8% return while the S&P fell 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Year 2**: Generated a 55% return while the S&P fell 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Year 3 (2002)**: Generated 16% while the S&P fell 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

Due to these results, investors provided more capital, and Burry was managing over $500 million for clients in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

## Predicting the Crisis

As depicted in "The Big Short," in 2006, Burry's [[michael_burrys_investment_strategy | investment style]] underwent a radical change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He shifted from buying stocks to investing his entire fund against the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This was a challenging period as his bet initially did not pay off, causing nervousness among investors due to the fund's radical change in focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

However, the crisis became evident in 2007 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This "big bet" yielded substantial profits, making him a legend in the [[michael_burrys_investment_strategies_and_portfolio_changes | investment fund]] industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

*   In 2007 alone, Scion Capital achieved a 160% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   The fund generated profits of over $700 million for its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.
*   Burry's personal fortune rapidly grew to over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.
*   Scion Capital produced an accumulated return of 700% annually for its clients, making it one of the most successful funds while managing client money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

Burry's story is cited as inspiring, particularly as he is described as an ordinary person without a finance background, contacts, or prior experience in the financial sector, who succeeded through effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

Currently, Michael Burry has [[michael_burrys_current_investment_portfolio | concentrated his stock portfolio]] into just six stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Recently, he also [[michael_burrys_market_analysis_and_warnings | warned of a possible new crisis]] in an interview with the *O Barnes* newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

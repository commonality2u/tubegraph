This article explores key principles and strategies for [[investment_funds_and_portfolio_management | managing an investment portfolio]], drawing insights from renowned investors like Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett. It emphasizes the importance of understanding business fundamentals, identifying resilient companies, and maintaining a long-term perspective amidst [[market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | market volatility]] and economic shifts.

## Key Insights from Bill Ackman
Bill Ackman, a prominent hedge fund manager, gained notoriety for a macroeconomic bet in 2020 that turned $27 million in CDS insurance premiums into $2.6 billion, contributing to a 70% performance that year and ranking among the 12 best stock trades in history [03:15:00]. Ackman has recently warned about a "bubble situation" in the economy and stock markets, particularly concerning certain stocks and the impact of rising interest rates and inflation [00:20:00].

He advises that central banks should "do the taper immediately," meaning they should stop printing money, buying bonds, and interfering in the market, as these actions have caused speculative bubbles in assets like electric vehicles, SPACs, renewable energy companies, cloud software, and cryptocurrencies [07:11:00].

Ackman's current [[investment_strategy_and_asset_allocation | investment strategy]] focuses on holding companies that are "predictable and resistant to crises" [02:55:00, 20:55:00].

## Characteristics of Resilient Businesses

### Predictable and Crisis-Resistant
Predictable businesses are those whose earnings can be understood and forecasted, and which demonstrate resilience during economic downturns [20:55:00, 21:05:00, 21:17:00]. Examples include companies whose products people continue to buy regardless of economic conditions, such as Domino's Pizza, Chipotle Mexican Grill, or even toothpaste [21:28:00, 21:50:00].

To assess a business's resilience:
1.  **Review its fundamentals during past crises**: Examine financial data (e.g., revenue evolution) from periods like the 2008 crisis (2007-2010) [25:53:00]. A business that performed well during such periods, even if sales slightly decreased, indicates strength [26:42:00, 27:03:00].
2.  **Observe long-term stock market behavior**: While technical analysis isn't endorsed, a business performing well on the stock market over 10-15 years often signifies a good underlying business [27:10:00, 27:27:00]. Companies like Nike, McDonald's, Louis Vuitton, and Apple have historically demonstrated this [27:42:00].

### Pricing Power
The most desirable feature in 2022, according to Bill Ackman, is "pricing power" â€“ the ability to raise prices without losing customers [23:26:00, 23:36:00]. This characteristic is crucial in inflationary environments. If a business struggles to raise prices by even 10% without losing customers, it suggests a weak business model [23:44:00, 23:55:00].

Businesses with strong pricing power include:
*   **Chipotle Mexican Grill**: Can raise menu prices if food costs increase, as it offers good value [22:31:00, 22:47:00].
*   **McDonald's**: Generates revenue from royalties and rents, which increase with inflation, while its own costs remain stable [36:06:00, 36:35:00].
*   **Nike**: Can raise prices by 5% annually, ensuring profit growth even if costs rise by 2-3% [24:35:00, 24:48:00].
*   **Luxury Brands (e.g., Louis Vuitton)**: Customers are willing to pay more [25:36:00].
*   **Visa/Mastercard**: Merchants accept them due to convenience and security, even with slight fee increases [30:47:00, 31:10:00].
*   **Sees Candies (Warren Buffett's example)**: Customers buy them for special occasions, so price is less a factor than quality [42:36:00, 45:20:00].
*   **Software Companies (e.g., Adobe, Microsoft, Oracle, Salesforce)**: Their products are essential and deeply integrated into user workflows, allowing them to raise subscription costs without significant customer loss [01:19:40, 01:20:01, 01:36:21, 01:39:29].

### Importance of Valuation
Buying good businesses at a reasonable price is crucial [25:18:00]. An asset may be predictable and durable, but overpaying can lead to poor returns [29:31:00]. Understanding how to value businesses, including estimating future earnings and comparing them to historical valuation ranges, is essential for identifying whether a stock is cheap or expensive [36:39:00, 58:36:00]. This involves analyzing financial statements, market potential, and comparable companies [01:04:08, 01:24:29].

> "The stock market is like a pendulum... They go from euphoria to pessimism and now we are beginning the phase of pessimism in these investments" [01:13:59].

### Qualitative and Quantitative Analysis
Understanding a business involves both quantitative analysis (numbers, financial reports) and qualitative characteristics (the "thinking about the business") [24:20:00, 24:24:00]. For instance, analyzing how a customer would react if prices increased by 10% reveals much about a company's pricing power and competitive advantages [28:09:00].

## Portfolio Construction and [[Importance of Portfolio Diversification | Diversification]]

### Concentration vs. Diversification
A basic rule of [[portfolio_management_and_investment_education | portfolio management]] is to diversify risk by holding 6-8-10 or even 15-20 different shares [01:05:00, 01:07:00, 02:05:01]. While experts like Bill Ackman manage billions with only six high-conviction holdings (e.g., Lowe's, Chipotle, Hilton, Howard Hughes, Domino's Pizza) [54:30:00], private investors typically benefit from broader diversification. However, diversifying into overvalued stocks (e.g., 40 times sales with no benefits) offers no real diversification; it merely creates a portfolio of overvalued assets [01:12:00, 01:15:00].

It is recommended that individual positions do not exceed 15-20% of the portfolio to avoid high concentration risk [02:07:26].

### Avoiding Overvalued Stocks
Speculative bubbles are characterized by companies with sky-high valuations (e.g., 40 times sales, 300 times earnings) that produce no profits or are expected to generate profits only in the distant future [09:25:00, 01:03:00]. These often include electric vehicle companies, SPACs, renewable energy, and cloud software firms [07:25:00]. When economic conditions tighten, these investments tend to reverse sharply [01:13:34].

## Impact of Macroeconomic Factors

### Inflation and Interest Rates
Rising inflation and interest rates significantly impact markets [00:27:00, 04:47:00]. Easy money policies (quantitative easing) created a "classic bubble" [03:54:00], but now the opposite forces (rate hikes, worsening economic conditions) are taking effect [04:20:00]. This shift means that businesses with pricing power are favored, as they can pass on increased costs to consumers [01:47:00, 01:48:00]. In contrast, companies that do not generate immediate cash flow and are based on long-term growth projections suffer, as their future value depreciates with inflation [01:22:20, 01:27:00].

### Monetary Policy
Central banks, more influential than politicians on the economy and stock market, are accelerating tightening policies. The Federal Reserve, for instance, is expected to implement three rate increases in 2022, a much faster pace than previously anticipated [06:44:00, 06:51:00]. This policy shift directly affects speculative assets that thrived on low interest rates and abundant liquidity [07:17:00].

## Examples of Companies and Their Performance

*   **McDonald's**: Sales dropped slightly (3%) in 2009 during the 2008 crisis, but gross margins expanded due to royalties and rents, leading to increased operational benefits [00:33:37, 00:36:06, 00:37:39]. The stock performed well during this period [00:38:14].
*   **Chipotle Mexican Grill (CMG)**: Despite a slowdown in growth during the 2008 crisis, sales continued to increase, and gross margins expanded, leading to significant profit growth [00:59:30, 00:59:51]. It also recovered strongly from a temporary food crisis in 2016, showcasing its resilience [01:00:26].
*   **Lowe's Companies**: During the 2008 real estate crisis, sales decreased by only 2%, even as housing construction plummeted by 70%, demonstrating its reliance on home maintenance and renovation rather than new construction [01:08:01, 01:10:21].
*   **Adobe**: Exhibited resilience during the 2008 crisis, with operating profit increasing despite a slight dip in sales, due to its essential software products that allow for price increases [01:19:10, 01:19:22, 01:37:38].
*   **Oracle**: A stable software company with recurring revenue, showing minimal impact from crises and steadily returning money to shareholders through buybacks [01:36:19, 01:38:36].
*   **Salesforce**: A growth company in cloud software, expected to grow solidly due to increasing demand for cloud services [01:39:20, 01:54:00].
*   **Visa**: Benefits from its near-oligopoly status in payment processing, allowing it to increase fees without losing merchants or customers [01:29:36].
*   **Barry Global (Amcor/Barry Global)**: An activist investor campaign aims to reduce its debt and expand its valuation to match rivals, indicating potential for value creation [02:02:50].
*   **Cellnex Telecom**: Benefits from the growing telecommunications sector, renting out towers to telcos. While it has high debt, its business model is robust to crises [01:58:38].
*   **Inditex (Zara)**: A quality, mature business with consistent growth, showing resilience despite market fluctuations and management changes [02:16:12].

### Companies to Avoid (Cyclical, Speculative)
Companies in highly cyclical sectors, such as steel manufacturing (e.g., ArcelorMittal), with low competitive advantages and capital-intensive operations, are highly sensitive to economic downturns [02:00:52, 02:01:44]. During the 2008 crisis, ArcelorMittal's sales dropped by 50%, and profit margins collapsed, demonstrating the risks of such investments [02:01:29]. Speculative companies or those whose value is driven by "easy money" and exuberance tend to crash when economic conditions tighten [07:25:00, 01:13:34].

## The Role of [[investment_funds_and_portfolio_management | Investment Funds]]
Investment funds like True Value funds aim to build portfolios of well-positioned companies that can perform well even in inflationary environments [01:32:56, 01:34:26]. Their [[investment_strategy_and_asset_allocation | investment strategy]] emphasizes predictable, long-lasting businesses purchased at reasonable prices, with growth prospects over 15% annually [01:50:00, 01:50:07]. The growth of these funds, managing hundreds of millions of euros and attracting thousands of investors, indicates the success of this cautious, long-term approach [01:50:29, 01:50:48].

## [[portfolio_management_and_investment_education | Investment Education]] and Discipline
Learning to invest effectively requires self-education, reading, practice, and understanding company fundamentals [01:34:00]. It is crucial to:
*   **Learn to think like an entrepreneur**: Understand how businesses operate and how customer decisions are made [01:44:00, 01:47:00].
*   **Avoid shortcuts**: The stock market is not "easy money" [01:28:50, 02:22:47]. Relying on alerts or trading robots rather than self-education and fundamental analysis is risky [02:23:08].
*   **Be patient**: Good businesses generate value over many years. Selling too soon or reacting to short-term market volatility can be detrimental [02:15:01, 02:25:15].
*   **Focus on making good purchases**: This is the primary controllable factor in investing, rather than trying to perfectly time sales [02:14:32, 02:14:52].
*   **Monitor and [[rebalancing_investment_portfolios | adjust]]**: Regularly review company results and adjust the portfolio if a business deteriorates or its intrinsic value changes significantly [02:07:48, 02:08:00].

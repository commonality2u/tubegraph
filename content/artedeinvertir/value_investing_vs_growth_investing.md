Howard Marx, a renowned investor, identifies a "transcendental change" in the investment landscape, marking the third such shift in 50 years that redefines what strategies work for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This shift is particularly relevant for the small investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Previous Paradigm (Last 13 Years)

For the past 13 years, coinciding with the 2008 financial crisis, specific [[Stock Market Investing Strategies | investment strategies]] have performed exceptionally well, which are now expected to be less effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

### 1. Passive vs. Active Investing

The post-2008 era saw a significant rise of [[Passive vs active investing trends | passive or indexed investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>. Capital flowed heavily into indexed funds, while active investment experienced outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This trend was fueled by easy money and a generally rising market, creating a "self-fulfilling prophecy" where index performance encouraged more index investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. While long-term passive investing can do well, short-term performance expectations, if unmet, can lead to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

### 2. Growth vs. Value Styles

The "growth style" of investing, particularly in companies with unprofitable growth that issued shares to finance losses, was highly successful, peaking around 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This included euphoria around stocks like Peloton, Palantir, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. In contrast, [[Investment methods Revaluation vs Dividends | value investing]], defined as buying companies for less than their worth, was out of favor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. The speaker highlights that this "dirtier growth" was not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. Historically, after periods where growth stocks became extremely expensive (e.g., 2008), a new cycle favoring value emerged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

### 3. Small Caps vs. Large Companies

Large companies significantly outperformed small caps during the past 13 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Historically, small caps have provided higher returns due to being less followed, having less liquidity, and possessing greater growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. For example, the S&P 500 doubled, while the Russell 2000 (small cap index) only rose 50% in almost 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. This divergence was influenced by easy money and capital flow towards indexed investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Small caps are currently much cheaper than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

### 4. US Stocks vs. International Markets

The United States stock market has performed exceptionally well compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The S&P 500 had a 230% return over 12 years, while European or emerging markets had a very poor performance, gaining only 50% in 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. This was partly due to the heavy weight of FANG stocks (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google) within US indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>. Currently, the rest of the world is trading at a significant discount (25-30%) compared to the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

## The New Investment Paradigm

The current environment is different, with central banks withdrawing liquidity and raising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This marks a new paradigm shift that requires investors to adapt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

> [!info] Central Bank Actions
> Central banks have indicated an imminent economic recession in the first quarter of 2023 for the eurozone and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Interest rate hikes are expected to continue, likely increasing by 0.5% in each of the next three meetings until reaching 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A monthly withdrawal of 15 billion in liquidity from the system is set to begin in March, effectively reversing previous quantitative easing measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

Recessions are closely linked to the number of new industrial orders in the United States, a leading indicator that has proven reliable in past recessions (2000-2001, 2008, 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. The ease of purchasing housing in the US is at levels seen before the 2007-2008 bubble burst, indicating stress in the real estate sector which heavily influences the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. Furthermore, excess savings accumulated during COVID-19 have been depleted due to inflation, leading to increased household indebtedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### Investment Strategies for the New Era

In this changing environment, investors need to be consistent with what is changing and adapt their [[Investment strategies for longterm growth | long-term growth]] strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

#### Sectors During Recession and Recovery
Fidelity's analysis suggests:
*   **During Recession (Contraction):** Discretionary consumption companies tend to perform well because the market anticipates their recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Technology and industrial companies may do poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>. The energy sector has done well in this recession due to energy inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
*   **During Recovery (Rebound):** Most sectors rebound, but safer sectors like healthcare, energy, and utilities may not benefit as much since they don't suffer significantly during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

#### Focus on Value and Undervalued Segments
The new paradigm is expected to favor:
*   **Value Investing**: Buying companies that make sense, generate cash flow, and have competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>. In contrast to "growth at any price" strategies that focused on sales rather than profits, often involving stock issuance and high compensation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:59">[00:36:59]</a>. Many high-growth stocks from the previous era have lost significant value and remain expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.
*   **Small Cap Companies**: These are often overlooked and undervalued, offering significant potential for growth and multiple expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **International Stocks**: Markets outside the US, particularly those trading at lower valuations, could offer better returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>.
*   **Companies outside main indices**: Stocks not heavily traded or included in major indices can be overlooked, creating opportunities for active investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:59">[00:27:59]</a>.

### Practical Examples of the Paradigm Shift

#### Small Cap vs. Large Company: Grupeillín (Small Cap) vs. J Maki (Large Cap)
*   **Grupeillín**: A small European company (370 million capitalization) making food packaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. It's not in major indices, has low liquidity, and less analyst coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>. Despite stable, predictable growth (avg. 5% annually) and low debt, it trades at significantly lower valuations (e.g., 8x PER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:46">[00:22:46]</a>.
*   **J Maki**: A Finnish company in the same sector, 10 times larger, with much higher liquidity and index inclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>. It has grown at a similar rate (6% annually) and earns the same per share as Grupeillín <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:59">[00:24:59]</a>. However, it trades 60% more expensive (e.g., 12x PER) due to its size and index benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.
*   **Divergence**: Historically, small companies were valued higher than large ones due to their growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:20">[00:26:20]</a>. The current divergence reflects a market mispricing driven by liquidity and index-following.

#### Non-indexed vs. Indexed: GDI (Non-indexed) vs. Compass Group (Indexed)
*   **GDI**: A Canadian company providing building maintenance services (cleaning, gardening, security) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:31">[00:28:31]</a>. It's highly crisis-resistant, predictable, and grows at 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. Due to low trading volume, it's not in major indices, making it "forgotten" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. It trades at 9x EV/EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Compass Group**: One of the largest global companies in the same sector, with a 30 billion dollar capitalization, included in major European and UK indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. It grows less (6% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">[00:30:44]</a>. Yet, people are willing to pay 26 times Free Cash Flow and 12 times EV/EBITDA for it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:17">[00:31:17]</a>.
*   **Divergence**: GDI, with higher growth and lower debt, is valued at half the price of Compass Group, simply because Compass Group is in the indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.

#### US vs. International: Globant (US) vs. Nagarro (International)
*   **Globant**: A large US-listed digital engineering company (7 billion capitalization), included in growth indices like Nasdaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. It has high growth (30% sales, 25% profits annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. It trades at nearly 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:36">[00:35:36]</a>.
*   **Nagarro**: A smaller German-listed company in the same sector, not in US indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:01">[00:35:01]</a>. Despite growing even more (40% vs. Globant's 30%) and having only slightly more debt, it trades at a significantly lower valuation (11x EV/EBITDA, 12-13x PER) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.
*   **Divergence**: The market has favored US-listed, larger, indexed companies, even when international, smaller counterparts demonstrate higher growth and better financial metrics.

#### Value vs. Growth: Berry Global (Value) vs. ARK Innovation ETF (Growth)
*   **ARK Innovation ETF (ARKK)**: A prime example of high-growth, disruptive technology investment that epitomized the "growth at any price" mentality of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:48">[00:38:48]</a>. This ETF lost 64% of its value in the past year, making recovery "tremendously complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:53">[00:38:53]</a>.
*   **Tesla**: A prominent growth stock that, after a period of euphoria, saw its stock collapse from $380 to $150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>. Despite the drop, its valuation remains demanding (28x PER) compared to the market average (17x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:19">[00:46:19]</a>. The company now faces demand problems and increased competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>.
*   **Berry Global**: A "boring" industrial company in the packaging sector that represents [[Differences between value stocks and growth stocks | value investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:34">[00:39:34]</a>. It has consistently grown sales (11%) and profits (17%), generating free cash flow every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>. Despite strong performance and an expected 27% growth in 2022, its valuation has been compressed to only 8 times earnings, half of its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. The company is actively buying back shares, indicating management believes they are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:29">[00:40:29]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway**: Warren Buffett's company, a pure example of [[Differences between value stocks and growth stocks | value investing]], has remained sideways in a difficult market year, showing no losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.
*   **Divergence**: The market's shift from favoring unsustainable growth to recognizing fundamental value is evident. While growth stocks saw massive declines, value-oriented, profitable businesses maintained stability or became even more attractive due to valuation compression.

## Conclusion

The current market environment, characterized by central bank actions and economic shifts, creates a unique opportunity for those prepared to invest with common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:28">[00:27:28]</a>. [[Investing in bear markets | Bear markets]] typically last one to two years, and once central banks lower interest rates, the market tends to rebound strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. Opportunities arise when "market fear" causes companies with strong fundamentals to fall, reducing the risk of permanent capital loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. Investors should focus on understanding business models, company prospects, debt, and management to make informed decisions, rather than generalizing or chasing past trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>. This approach allows for [[diversification with growth and value stocks | diversification]] and capitalizing on market volatility.

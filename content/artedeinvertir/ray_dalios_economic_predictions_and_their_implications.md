These transformations are expected to profoundly affect currency values (like the dollar and euro), real estate investments, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Who is Ray Dalio?
[[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] is recognized as one of the most influential figures in the economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He is the manager of the world's largest investment fund, Bridgewater, overseeing more than $100 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This sum surpasses the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of several countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

Throughout his career, [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] has demonstrated a high degree of accuracy in [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | predicting major economic changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He successfully safeguarded his investment portfolios during significant downturns, including the 2008 financial crisis and the 2000 technological bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. Having achieved multimillionaire status, [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] has made his economic research public, notably through his book *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. For some time, he has been advising society to adapt to this new economic reality to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Key Predictions

In a recent interview, [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] revealed the exact date he believes these economic shifts will commence, along with the underlying reasons and triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He suggests that the world will begin to change significantly around 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

### Three Confounding Problems
[[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] identifies three interconnected problems converging, which, when combined, present an even greater challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>:

1.  **Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle**: A recession is emerging, coupled with significant social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. This inequality is fueling societal and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
    *   **Implications of Inequality**: The rising inequality, where 90% of the American population owns less wealth, contributes to the rise of populist parties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. This trend is expected to negatively impact economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this, as governments issued substantial debt to save the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This debt will be repaid through taxes on the working class, who did not benefit from recent economic booms in housing, stock market, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

2.  **Loss of US Competitive Advantage**: The United States is losing its competitive edge to China, which will have severe consequences for the West and its wealth levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
    *   **The US as a Declining Empire**: [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] describes the US as a 75-year-old empire showing clear signs of decline, currently in a terminal phase of its credit cycle, characterized by massive debt production and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
    *   **The Dollar's Future**: Historically, the US could issue debt and print dollars without collapsing its currency's value due to its dominant global economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. However, [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in GDP, global relevance (military, technological innovation, influence) around 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. The solution to past crises has been to print new dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>, but if confidence in the dollar is lost in the next crisis, this "recipe" may fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. In 2020 alone, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
    *   **Five-Year Outlook**: [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] predicts that within five years, foreign lenders may cease lending to the US, and the dollar may no longer be easily accepted globally for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He warns that society will struggle as difficult times arrive, with the poor demanding more from the rich, and the rich seeking to protect their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

3.  **Economic Phases - Rise and Decline**: [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]]'s study of economic history reveals two fundamental phases: rise and decline, each defined by specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. The US is currently entering a decline phase, characterized by high debt and alarming levels of money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Conversely, China is in an ascending phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Advice for Protecting Investments

[[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] offers specific advice for small investors to protect their savings and investments, and even capitalize on future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>:

### 1. Avoid Holding Liquidity
Investors must be concerned about the value of money itself, not just investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>. The significant money printing has led to inflation, which erodes purchasing power, forcing individuals to become investors in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

### 2. Diversify Well
Diversification is crucial, extending across countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. The goal is for another asset to rise when one in the portfolio declines, maintaining portfolio stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

### The Four Seasons Portfolio
[[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] developed the "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory to manage investments, preparing a portfolio for both favorable and unfavorable economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

Based on his portfolio management, he recommends including a series of assets:

*   **Stocks (40% of investments)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>:
    *   In the current economic environment, characterized by high inflation that is expected to drop, emerging market stocks perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
    *   Small-cap stocks are also highly recommended in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. While large investors like [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] may face liquidity challenges with individual small-cap companies, ETFs focused on smart caps, such as LT EFE and WM (Russell 2000 index ETF), are viable alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Historically, low-utilization stocks in similar conditions have yielded returns exceeding 17% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. This is due to less market following (leading to undervaluation), greater growth potential for smaller companies, and inaccessibility for large institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

*   **Gold (Small percentage, never exceeding 10%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>: Can be accessed through ETFs related to gold mining companies or physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. *Note: [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]]'s own portfolio analysis suggests that gold might have a worse performance in the current scenario, contrary to popular belief <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>.*

*   **Bonds (Never exceeding 40% of investments)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>: This includes inflation-protected bonds, which are currently very interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>. Bonds offer a defensive component, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>. However, [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] notes a "bubble" in the bond market due to new money printing, leading him to apply a more conservative asset allocation to this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.

[[Ray Dalios new world economic order | Ray Dalio]]'s insights underscore the need for investors to adapt their strategies in anticipation of profound global economic shifts.

The U.S. dollar, considered the most important currency globally, is predicted to begin its decline, a process that recent decisions by central banks and governments are expected to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This information is crucial for investors and non-investors alike, as the dollar's fate impacts economies and stock markets worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This article outlines ways to [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | protect capital and savings]] from this devaluation and explores [[investment_strategies_to_hedge_against_dollar_depreciation | investment opportunities]] that could benefit from the dollar's potential end as the global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## The Declining Dollar: Causes and Impacts

Currently, the dollar serves as the global foreign exchange reserve, meaning its fluctuations affect other currencies and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It would be naive to assume one would not be affected by its devaluation, even without holding dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

### Monetary Expansion

Approximately 62% of the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars, and with many economies being dollarized, the real percentage could exceed 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A startling fact is that in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created, a significant figure given the currency's 200-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Since the beginning of the recent crisis, the dollar has devalued over 10% against the Euro in just nine months, even though Europe is also printing new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Most major world currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Until the 1970s, new dollars had to be backed by gold deposits in central banks, which controlled inflation and aggressive currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This changed in the early 1970s with the Bretton Woods Agreement, granting the Federal Reserve the ability to print unlimited dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. While this tool was used cautiously in the past, the money supply (M2) has drastically increased since early 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

The Federal Reserve and its president, Jerome Powell, have stated they are comfortable with higher inflation levels in the future, signaling further increases in the money supply and dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Historical Precedents of Devaluation

Historically, such monetary experiments have not worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:
*   The Roman Empire declined in value as its currency was aggressively devalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Germany in the early 20th century attempted to repay old debts through printing money and ended up bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   More recently, Venezuela has faced disastrous economic consequences due to devalued currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Zimbabwe issued a 100 trillion dollar banknote, which now sells as a souvenir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

## Expert Warnings and [[how_to_protect_investments_during_economic_changes | Investment Strategies]]

Leading investors have warned about the dollar's future decline.

### Ray Dalio

Ray Dalio, manager of the world's largest [[protecting_investments_amidst_economic_uncertainty | investment fund]], Bridgewater Associates, has stated that the dollar will lose value and he is selling the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Considered the "Steve Jobs of financial markets," Dalio's ability to anticipate economic events has made him one of the wealthiest people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. He warned Bloomberg that the dollar could cease to be the world's foreign currency reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Dalio invests in gold, inflation-protected bonds, and stocks outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller

Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller, known for average annual returns over 30% for more than 30 years without any losses, is aggressively selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. He stated in a CNN interview that the Federal Reserve and Treasury's union, effectively happening during the crisis, sets an unprecedented precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. He anticipates increased inflation over the next 5-6 years due to dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

Druckenmiller is investing in gold and buying mining companies expected to benefit from future inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

### Impact Beyond the US

Even if you don't live in the US or hold dollars, this economic phenomenon will affect you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Central banks and economies worldwide are replicating the US approach, increasing the amount of new euros, yen, or pounds being printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. Consequently, money held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Fixed income or bonds are also significantly affected by increased inflation and currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Practical [[Investment Strategies to Hedge Against Dollar Depreciation | Investment Strategies]]

Here are several ways to protect your savings and capital from dollar devaluation:

### 1. Real Estate Properties

Investing in real estate is an effective way to protect against currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. However, it often requires large capital and extensive diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. The stock market offers alternatives for smaller capital with higher diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### 2. Selling Dollars (Forex Market)

The most direct way to benefit from a potential dollar drop is to sell dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. This is done in the forex market, where one currency is sold against another (e.g., dollar/euro or dollar/pound) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. A challenge is that if the counter-currency (like the euro) also devalues due to new money printing, the profit may be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Gold

Gold acts like any other currency but cannot be created out of thin air, unlike fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>. As the dollar devalues (more dollars in circulation), the price of gold tends to rise when denominated in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Historically, investing in gold was complex due to storage and security costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, now, through ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds), investors can own physical gold stored safely at a much more effective cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   **Europe Example**: iShares Physical Gold ETF (ticker: SGLN) listed on the London Stock Exchange, appreciated over 40% in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   **US Example**: SPDR Gold Shares ETF (ticker: GLD) listed in the US, has also shown good performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### 4. Investing in Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)

As Ray Dalio suggests, investing in bonds, specifically TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), can protect against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. If the dollar falls, inflation will increase, and these bonds will appreciate in value based on that inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. A simple way to invest in TIPS is through ETFs, such as iShares TIPS Bond ETF (ticker: TIP) listed in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This ETF appreciated over 10% year-to-date in 2020 due to dollar devaluation and high inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### 5. Investing in Stocks Outside the US

Investing in non-US stocks protects against dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. If US stocks are denominated in dollars, any gains from stock appreciation could be lost due to currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Ray Dalio has chosen this channel, investing $200 million in an emerging markets ETF (ticker: EEM) that invests in stocks of less indebted countries outside the US that don't need to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. This ETF has performed well in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

### 6. Investing in Large US Exporting Companies

Large US exporting companies historically benefit from currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. They sell products abroad, theoretically receiving more valuable foreign currency, while their costs remain constant (denominated in dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. This increases their income and earnings per share, which tends to be reflected in stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

**Practical Examples:**

*   **Rolls Royce (UK)**: After the 2016 Brexit vote caused the pound to plummet over 10%, Rolls Royce, which manufactures in the UK but exports globally, appreciated over 30% in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline (UK)**: Similarly, the pharmaceutical company GlaxoSmithKline rose over 20% immediately after the pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

**US Exporting Company Examples:**

*   **ExxonMobil (XOM)**: The world's largest oil company, listed in the US under ticker XOM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It meets two conditions for protection against currency devaluation: it produces raw materials (oil price tends to rise if dollar goes down) and exports over half its products outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. ExxonMobil has historically traded at 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. At normalized oil levels ($50-$65), it can earn around $4 per share and pay a $3 dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. Its current price ($38) suggests a potential target value of $60 (4x15) or even $75 (3x25, based on historical 4% dividend yield) as oil prices normalize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>.
*   **Pfizer (PFE)**: A leading biotechnology company listed in the US under ticker PFE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>. Warren Buffett has invested over $135 million in Pfizer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Over 50% of its sales are outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Pfizer expects to earn around $3 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. The biotechnology sector typically trades at 18 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. This suggests a target value of $54 per share (3x18) for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.

Other large US exporting companies that could also perform well in any economic environment and trade at reasonable valuations include Apple, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Bill Gates, one of the world's richest individuals, has significantly increased his [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] in arable land, becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He currently owns over 240,000 acres of arable land, a number that continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His macroeconomic vision has historically been very accurate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>, making this move particularly noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## Reasons for Investing in Farmland

Bill Gates' [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | investment decisions]] in agriculture and farmland are driven by several key factors:

*   **Climate Change Concerns**
    *   Gates holds a very negative view on climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He anticipates more extreme weather, leading to less global food production and a drastic increase in raw material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.
    *   For example, corn production is projected to decrease by 24% by 2050 due to climate change effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.
    *   The value of land has consistently risen over decades as the climate change process has advanced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.
*   **Biofuels Potential**
    *   Agriculture is crucial for the future of cheap biofuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. If affordable, biofuels could solve CO2 emissions in transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
    *   Biofuels made from raw materials like sugarcane, soybeans, or corn have favorable characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.
    *   This sector is expected to see significant growth, reaching $300 billion by 2027 at an 11% annual growth rate, four times higher than the general economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**
    *   Land is an excellent [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | investment]] in periods of high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
    *   Even if disposable income decreases, food consumption will be maintained, ensuring demand and rising prices for food grown on land <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   During the high inflation of the 1980s, arable land prices rose while the S&P 500 collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>.
*   **Water Scarcity**
    *   The most compelling reason Bill Gates has given is the impending water shortage due to climate change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>.
    *   Arable lands with access to quality water will become very valuable in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
    *   Desalinating seawater and moving it to agricultural areas is currently too expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
    *   Michael Burry, another renowned [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | investor]], also believes in accumulating this type of [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] as protection against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Expert Endorsement

Warren Buffett, a close friend of Bill Gates and a famous [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | investor]], has also recommended that investors allocate a portion of their portfolio to [[sectorspecific_investment_opportunities | land and agriculture]], citing them as very safe and profitable long-term [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Buffett himself holds over 2,000 acres of arable land in his [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. He publicly stated he would always choose land over [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_energy_sectors | gold]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

> "When investing in land and agriculture, I believe that over a long enough period of time, this [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] category will prove to be very profitable and most importantly, it will be by far a very safe [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]]." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>

This rare and favorable public statement from Buffett underscores the significance of agricultural [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

## Ways for Small Investors to Invest in Agriculture

While directly buying land can be complicated, there are other [[examples_of_investment_opportunities_in_affected_sectors | opportunities]] for small investors to benefit from the positive evolution of agriculture:

### 1. Agricultural Equipment Companies

*   **Deere & Company (DE)**: Bill Gates has invested in this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>.

    *   Shares have multiplied 20 times in the last 20 years, outperforming US arable land [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
    *   Forecasted to earn around $18 per share, trading at less than 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
    *   Could reach $600 per share in the next five years if past growth replicates, offering interesting potential for a company with low debt, strong competitive advantage, and predictable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

### 2. Plant-Based Protein Companies

*   The rise in popularity of plant-based protein foods like Beyond Meat or Impossible Foods is another reason for agricultural [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.

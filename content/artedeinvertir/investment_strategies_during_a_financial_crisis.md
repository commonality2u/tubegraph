The topic of [[investment_strategy_during_a_stock_market_crisis | investment strategies during a financial crisis]] is crucial, especially when facing potential economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## Expert Views on Economic Crises

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater, the world's largest hedge fund managing 170 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>, has made "pretty shocking statements" about the economy potentially facing a situation "even worse than that of 2008" and resembling the Great Depression of 1929, where the market fell 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Dalio's fund is known for generating very predictable returns, losing money in very few years, with returns typically between 8% to 12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>.

He identifies three key long-term factors that could impact investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>:

1.  **The Rise of China and the Yuan**
    China's GDP is expected to surpass the United States' by 2026-2027, becoming the world's largest economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This could shift the paradigm from the dollar as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>. The U.S. currently prints vast amounts of money without significant harm because the dollar is the economic base, giving it a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. However, the dollar's market share has declined from 66% in 2014, as confidence wanes and alternatives like the Yuan, Yen, and Euro gain traction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.
2.  **Economic Inequality**
    The top 1% of the richest people in the U.S. now own over 20% of the national wealth, up from 10%, while the poorest 50% have seen their share drop from 20% to less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This growing disparity can lead to the rise of politicians with communist or populist tendencies, resulting in higher taxes, more regulations, and increased difficulty for businesses, negatively impacting the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Historically, periods of high taxes and anti-capitalist environments (e.g., 1938-1950) were "terrible" for the stock market, leading to 20 lost years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
3.  **Unprecedented Money Printing**
    The current financial experiment of printing huge amounts of money is having a "tremendous impact" on the market, with global liquidity highly correlated to S&P 500 behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Money printing during the recent crisis has been even greater than in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. This leads to inflation, reflected in increasing home and real estate prices, with inventories at minimums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

## Strategies for Protecting Investments

### Ray Dalio's All-Weather Portfolio
Dalio's strategy involves the "all-weather portfolio" or "four seasons portfolio," which diversifies investments across stocks, bonds (including inflation-protected bonds and emerging country bonds), and commodities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This portfolio is designed to perform well in all four main economic scenarios: rising/falling economic growth combined with rising/falling inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. While Dalio is adjusting his portfolio to account for a liquidity bubble in fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, this strategy has historically generated a predictable 7% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Approach
Warren Buffett's method, easier for small investors, focuses on accumulating liquidity and investing in high-quality companies at reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. He has consistently warned of market excesses, returning capital to investors before the 1969 crash and warning about market expense before the dot-com bubble in 1999 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.

[!note|Key Takeaways from Buffett's Strategy]
*   **Accumulate Liquidity:** Buffett has accumulated significant liquidity (e.g., 130 billion dollars) to take advantage of future opportunities during market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.
*   **Invest in Quality Companies:** He focuses on high-quality companies with essential products or services (e.g., Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, Moody's) that are not cyclical, have low debt, and are bought at non-excessive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.
*   **Volatility is Your Friend:** Crises, like March 2020, create opportunities to buy shares at "ridiculous prices," which often have minimal risk when based on intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Focus:** Buffett's investment style has historically performed well across various economic conditions, focusing on companies that generate long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

[!warning|Avoid Shorting the Market]
Going short or betting against the market with derivatives, futures, or options is "the worst idea" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Funds that constantly bet against the market have consistently lost money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. It is impossible to time market downturns precisely, and the stock market tends to recover and prosper in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>.

## Anti-Crisis Investment Opportunities

Here are examples of "anti-crisis" companies that tend to perform well during economic downturns and continue to prosper afterward:

*   **McDonald's (MCD)**
    *   **Behavior During Crisis:** Sales and profits tend to increase during crises as people seek cheaper dining options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>. During the 2007-2010 crisis, McDonald's operating profit increased, and its stock price rose from $45 to $70 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:22">[00:19:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Growth Drivers:** Opens about 2% new stores annually and experiences 3% average same-store sales growth due to increased customers or inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>.
    *   **Returns:** An expected annual return of 9% from store growth, same-store sales, and shareholder returns (dividends and buybacks) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

*   **GD Integrated Facilities Services (Head)**
    *   **Behavior During Crisis:** This Canadian company provides essential building maintenance services (security, cleaning, HVAC) to companies, which are recurring and not cut during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:35">[00:24:35]</a>.
    *   **Growth Drivers:** Grew 20% annually in sales and operating cash flow since 2008, even through the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:02">[00:24:02]</a>. It can also grow through mergers and acquisitions during crises when companies become cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>. Contracts are linked to inflation, allowing price increases without proportional cost increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
    *   **Returns:** Estimated annual return of 15% to 22% due to growth potential and contained risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:53">[00:27:53]</a>.

*   **AutoZone (AZO)**
    *   **Behavior During Crisis:** Sells car spare parts. During crises, people repair old cars instead of buying new ones, leading to increased sales for AutoZone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Performance:** During the 2007-2010 crisis, earnings per share increased significantly (13% to 27%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>. The stock price rose from $120 to $150 in the same period, while the overall market dropped 55% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:54">[00:31:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:11">[00:32:11]</a>.
    *   **Returns:** Expected average annual return of 9-15% through store openings, increased sales per store, and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:35">[00:33:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>.

*   **Fairfax Financial Holdings (FFH)**
    *   **Strategy:** Led by Prem Watsa (the "Warren Buffett of Canada"), Fairfax acquires insurance businesses and invests the float (policyholder premiums) into publicly traded or private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:02">[00:34:02]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Protection:** Watsa is cautious and always buys hedges or derivatives to protect against market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:21">[00:34:21]</a>. During the 2008 crisis, while the S&P 500 fell significantly, Fairfax Financial shares actually rose 99% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:35">[00:34:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

*   **Open Text (OTEX)**
    *   **Business:** Provides software for companies to store and manage information securely, an essential and recurring service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:20">[00:36:20]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Resilience:** Companies will not stop paying for this service during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:54">[00:36:54]</a>. Sales and profits increased during the 2006-2010 period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
    *   **Growth Drivers:** Similar to GD, Open Text grows through acquisitions, taking advantage of cheaper company valuations during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. Over 80% of its income is recurring from licenses and maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:11">[00:38:11]</a>.
    *   **Returns:** The company aims for $5 in free cash flow per share by 2024, with potential for significant future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:45">[00:38:45]</a>.

*   **Moody's (MCO)**
    *   **Business:** A rating agency, part of a monopoly alongside S&P and Fitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>. Companies must be rated by at least two of these three agencies to issue bonds at lower interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:40">[00:49:40]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Resilience:** Moody's benefits when governments and companies issue debt as a solution to crises, as all bonds require their seal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. Its profits increased 22% last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:49">[00:51:49]</a>.
    *   **Growth & Returns:** World debt grows 5% annually, and Moody's raises client prices by another 5%, plus share buybacks add 3-4% to returns, leading to an expected 13-15% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:01">[00:52:01]</a>.

*   **Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)**
    *   **Business:** Manages private equity funds, similar to investment funds, charging clients a percentage and investing its own money alongside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:47">[01:12:47]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Benefit:** As fixed income yields decline, more money flows into private equity funds from insurance companies, governments, and pension plans seeking stable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:20">[01:14:20]</a>.
    *   **Growth & Returns:** Brookfield has a plan to reach $5 in profit per share by 2024/2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:42">[01:13:42]</a>, with a clear path to reach $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>. The company aims to double its earnings from fund management to $2.6 billion by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:46">[01:19:46]</a>.

*   **Green Brick Partners (GRBK) & Sant Joe Company (JOE)**
    *   **Sector:** Homebuilding. Due to low housing inventories (half of the normal 1.5 million homes), millions of new homes need to be built in the next 4-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:48">[01:23:48]</a>. This has driven housing prices up by 20-30% year-over-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:39">[01:24:39]</a>.
    *   **Green Brick:** Builds typical American houses in high-growth southern states <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:30">[01:23:30]</a>. Expected to earn nearly $4 next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:25">[01:25:25]</a>.
    *   **Sant Joe:** The largest landowner of buildable land in Florida, a state with low taxes and high migration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>. The company owns land for the next 100 years and is growing at rates of 100% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:09">[01:26:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:42">[01:26:42]</a>.
    *   **NVR Inc (NVR):** Considered the "best" in the homebuilding sector, NVR has a unique business model and has grown consistently, even during difficult years. It maintains a solid performance despite being cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:01">[01:27:01]</a>. During the US real estate crisis, NVR delivered an 11.9% return, significantly outperforming competitors like Toll Brothers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:18">[01:28:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:36">[01:28:36]</a>.

*   **Polaris Infrastructure Inc (PIF) / NeoGames (NGMS)**
    *   **Sector:** Online lottery and sports betting. Online gaming is growing tremendously, with only 1% of the market currently online, while 90% is still physical betting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:39">[01:05:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:44">[01:05:44]</a>.
    *   **NeoGames:** Best positioned company for online lottery, especially as US states authorize online ticket purchases to generate new revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:01">[01:09:01]</a>. NeoGames holds monopolies in certain states, leading to high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:26">[01:10:26]</a>. The company can potentially multiply its sales ten times in 5-10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:22">[01:11:22]</a>. Polaris owns half of NeoGames <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:31">[01:09:31]</a>.
    *   **Kindred Group (KIND-SDB):** Another online gaming company that has performed well since the crisis began, growing from 40 to 150 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:09">[01:04:09]</a>. It's important to ensure such companies operate in regulated markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:11">[01:05:11]</a>.

*   **Kaissa Stock Holding (6660.HK)**
    *   **Business:** Provides building maintenance services (gardening, cleaning, security, HVAC) in China, similar to GD Integrated Facilities Services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:35">[01:39:35]</a>.
    *   **Growth Drivers:** Benefits from China's growing sector, rising population, GDP growth, and government mandates for professional building management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:53">[01:39:53]</a>.
    *   **Performance:** Grew from 600 million to 2.9 billion in billing, growing faster than many tech companies in fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:31">[01:38:31]</a>. The company targets 8 Hong Kong dollars in profit per share in 3-4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:12">[01:39:12]</a>.
    *   **Risk:** No special risk in investing in Hong Kong as it's an economic zone China wants to keep on its current path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:31">[01:41:31]</a>.

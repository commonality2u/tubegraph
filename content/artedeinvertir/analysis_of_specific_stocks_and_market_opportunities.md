## Warren Buffett's Latest Investment
Warren Buffett has invested an impressive $7 billion in a new sector and a specific stock, which he initially sought to keep secret from the SEC [00:00:05]. This information is now public due to legal requirements [00:00:16]. Buffett's interest lies in the insurance sector, which has historically yielded him significant returns [00:00:25], and he has considerable experience in this area [00:00:28].

His recent investment is in a stock currently at an all-time high, demonstrating that even top investors buy at such peaks, challenging the notion that one must always wait for prices to drop [00:01:16]. The selected stock is valued significantly lower than the market average [00:01:43].

### The Insurance Sector: A Lucrative History
The [[valuation_and_performance_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | insurance sector]] is one of the most profitable for Warren Buffett, contributing significantly to his wealth throughout his career [00:01:49]. Since 1988, a dollar invested in Berkshire Hathaway has multiplied over 100 times, compared to a 20-fold increase for a dollar invested in the S&P 500 [00:02:00].

One of Buffett's most successful historical investments in this sector is Geico, a low-cost auto insurance company [00:02:19]. Geico's income skyrocketed from very little in 1998 to almost $20 billion, representing a substantial portion of Buffett's fortune [00:02:23]. Within Berkshire Hathaway's holding company, the insurance sector accounts for a large segment of his investments, predominantly in private companies acquired over the years [00:02:41]. The current public stock purchase is one of his latest in this sector [00:02:50].

### The Power of "Float"
The key to profitability in the insurance sector, as explained by Warren Buffett, is "the float" [00:03:56]. This refers to money collected from policyholders that does not yet belong to the insurer but can be invested for profit before claims are paid [00:04:08]. When policyholders pay their premiums (e.g., $1,000), the insurer can invest this money for an average period of 6, 12, or 24 months before paying out a typically lower compensation (e.g., $900) [00:04:31]. Unlike banks that pay interest to depositors, insurers retain this money for free, making profits both from selling insurance and from investing the float [00:05:03].

Regulations typically limit high-risk investments with float, often requiring investment in treasury bills, fixed income, or short-term bonds, with only a small portion (e.g., 10-15%) in the stock market [00:05:27]. Warren Buffett, however, leveraging his investment expertise, strategically invests more of this float in stocks to accelerate wealth generation [00:05:57]. Studies suggest that 40-50% of Berkshire Hathaway's performance is attributable to the intelligent use of this float and Buffett's investment abilities [00:06:21].

As of March 2024, Berkshire Hathaway's total float from its insurance businesses is $168 billion [00:06:42]. Even an average annual return of 5-7% on this float could generate over $20 billion in pre-tax profits, a massive flow that accounts for a large part of Berkshire's value [00:07:03]. This float has consistently grown over time [00:07:29].

### The Current Insurance Market Landscape
While the insurance business is mature with well-distributed market shares, situations of high growth can still yield very high returns [00:07:40]. The overall profitability of an insurance company depends on two main factors: the result of investments from the float and the technical result from selling insurance, measured by the combined ratio [00:08:11]. A lower combined ratio (e.g., 93% means a 7% profit margin from sales) indicates better profitability [00:08:28]. Some companies, like State Farm, might even operate with a combined ratio over 100% (selling at a loss) to acquire float for investment, demonstrating the value of this capital [00:08:41].

The combined ratio is composed of the loss ratio (compensation payments) and the expense ratio (broker commissions, administrative costs, advertising, staff) [00:09:09]. Actuarial sciences are used to statistically estimate compensation probabilities [00:10:49].

Despite the inherent profitability and Warren Buffett's interest, the [[valuation_and_performance_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | insurance sector]] is currently one of the cheapest in the S&P 500 and Europe [00:11:05]. Insurance ETFs, such as the KIE, show good performance, reaching historical highs [01:11:45]. The sector's estimated earnings growth for the next 3-5 years is a decent 18%, and it trades at about 12 times earnings, or even 11 times for the following year [01:11:54]. This contrasts sharply with the S&P 500's 20 times earnings and large technology companies' almost 30 times earnings on average [01:12:06].

### Warren Buffett's Chosen Stock: Chap (CB)
Chap (ticker: CB) is the company Warren Buffett has been aggressively investing in [02:42:59]. It has an impressive track record, with its stock performing very well over 10-20 years, indicating a strong underlying business [02:50:00]. Chap sells property insurance, including home, car, health, accident, and even agricultural insurance, with broad lines focused on corporations rather than directly on individuals [02:50:00]. For example, they might insure a large office building rather than a small home [02:56:41].

#### Competitive Advantages of Chap
Insurer competitive advantages, particularly in "Big Data," come from understanding risk after providing many policies [02:59:12]. This allows them to price insurance profitably and protects them from competitors who might incur losses by undercutting prices and taking on higher risks [02:59:21]. This creates a "moat" around the business, similar to what Warren Buffett seeks [03:00:03]. Chap's stock performance reflects this, having multiplied over 30 times since its listing, in addition to paying dividends [03:00:54].

Comparing Chap to its competitors, its combined ratio (profit margin from insurance sales) is consistently higher, indicating greater discipline and knowledge in providing insurance and a probable competitive advantage [03:01:00]. For instance, Chap's combined ratio was 86% last year, meaning a 14% profit margin [02:52:00].

#### Chap's Financials and Investment Strategy
Chap manages its investments prudently, with a book value of $60 billion and only $15 billion in debt, a low debt-to-book value ratio of approximately 0.25 [03:06:01]. It holds a "double-A" credit rating from S&P, indicating very high credit quality, crucial for insurers as clients prioritize solvency [03:06:21].

Chap's investment philosophy for its float is conservative: 84% is invested in debt with a maximum duration of 5 years to minimize the impact of interest rate changes [03:07:05]. 93% of its investment portfolio is in super conservative bonds (triple-A to triple-B) [03:07:22]. This conservative approach is a trait Warren Buffett values [03:08:06].

There is speculation that Warren Buffett's initial position in Chap is a prelude to buying the entire company, given Chap's significant float of $120 billion [03:08:43]. While Chap currently yields 3-4% from this float, Warren Buffett could potentially achieve 50-60% more if he controlled the company [03:09:47]. Chap's float of $120 billion is equivalent to nearly three full years of its $50 billion in annual insurance sales, indicating multi-year policies that provide a more valuable and longer-term float [03:09:50].

Chap's earnings per share have grown significantly, from $4 in 2005 to $24 currently, a seven to eight-fold increase, reflecting approximately 12-13% annual return plus dividends [03:10:00]. While earnings can be volatile in the insurance sector, the book value evolution is more linear [03:10:18]. The company's return on equity (ROE) averages 12%, generally implying it should trade at 1.5 times book value [03:10:30]. Low interest rates negatively impacted insurers, but with current higher rates, their profitability has increased, as seen in Chap's 13-15% annual profitability since 2022-2023 [03:10:37].

Chap is valued at 12 times earnings, aligning with the insurance sector average but well below the S&P 500's 20 times earnings [03:10:41]. Its historical valuation floor has been 10 times earnings (reached in 2023 when Buffett started buying) and typically trades at 12-13 times [03:10:49]. Buffett likely aims for gains through gradual earnings increases rather than multiple expansion, or a potential full acquisition [03:10:55].

### Kinsale Capital Group
Kinsale Capital Group (ticker: KNSL) is another interesting insurance company that has provided historical returns over 30% per year, with its stock multiplying 20 times in the last 5-7 years [03:12:00]. It stands out as a publicly listed insurer with high growth, unlike many mature companies in the sector [03:12:00]. Kinsale specializes in the "excess and surplus lines" market niche, insuring high-risk activities with specific needs (e.g., construction, commercial transportation, electricians) where traditional insurers might not have expertise or interest [03:12:00]. This specialization allows them to charge higher prices due to less competition [03:12:00].

Kinsale's competitive advantages include a large database of these specific risks and "contrarian underwriting" [03:12:00]. This means they seize opportunities when others retreat, such as raising prices after a major event like a hurricane, even if competitors are scared away [03:12:00]. This strategy is similar to Warren Buffett's approach with his reinsurance companies [03:12:00]. Kinsale also maintains a low-cost model and doesn't delegate policy issuance to maintain control [03:12:00].

Despite its high growth, Kinsale holds a small market share (1.1%) in a $100 billion annual market in the U.S., indicating significant room for continued growth [03:12:00]. Its profits have seen impressive growth, with 2024 earnings expected to be 12 times higher than in 2016 [03:12:00]. Kinsale's combined ratio is significantly better than comparable companies, indicating higher profit margins and underwriting discipline [03:12:00]. Its investment portfolio, though smaller at $3 billion, is conservatively managed with 99% in investment-grade bonds [03:12:00].

The stock recently dropped due to short-term fears of decelerating growth, although its premium issuance still grew 25% year-over-year [03:12:00]. This slowdown from previous 30-50% growth rates, combined with lower price increases in the insurance sector (3-4% now vs. 14% via inflation during pandemic), led to market disappointment [03:12:00]. Despite this, its combined ratio and book value have improved, and its valuation (25 times earnings) is below its historical average of 35 times [03:12:00].

### Markel
Markel (ticker: MKL) is presented as a smaller alternative to Berkshire Hathaway, following a similar business model of owning insurance companies and investing their float in bonds, stocks, and acquiring other companies [03:12:00]. It has demonstrated strong performance, with its stock rising from $8 to $1,600 per share [03:12:00]. Markel's book value growth has been spectacular and stable, recovering quickly from dips in 2008, 2018, and 2020 [03:12:00]. This stability reflects the predictable nature of the insurance business, as most governments require auto insurance and individuals seek home or life insurance, making it a non-cyclical sector [03:12:00].

Markel's sales grew by 10% annually, and profits by over 15% annually on average, contributing to a 15% average annual stock market return in recent years [03:12:00]. Markel manages its $26 billion float aggressively, with 35% ($9 billion) invested in stocks, similar to Warren Buffett's approach [03:12:00]. Its stock portfolio, managed by Thomas Giner, is well-constructed and diversified, including high-quality companies like Disney, Microsoft, Apple, Google, and Berkshire Hathaway itself [03:12:00]. While the overall company performance is influenced by the lower portion invested in stocks, the stock selection has been strong, yielding returns like 21% in 2023 and 29% in 2021 [03:12:00].

Markel's combined ratio worsened slightly to 98% last year due to the loss ratio but generally remains well-managed [03:12:00]. Its price-to-book value ratio is currently 1.4, aligning with its average and suggesting future performance will be driven by book value growth, historically around 12-13% [03:12:00].

## [[analysis_of_the_stock_market_environment | Analysis of the Stock Market Environment]] and Macroeconomic Indicators
The speaker addresses why Warren Buffett is buying despite macroeconomic concerns, such as interest rates and inflation [01:29:00].

### Yield Curve Inversion
The inversion of the yield curve (10-year bond yield minus 3-month bond yield) is a significant market fear [01:29:00]. Historically, when the 10-year bond yields less than the 3-month treasury bill, it precedes economic recessions [01:29:00]. Such inversions occurred before the 2000 and 2008 recessions [01:29:00]. The recession typically begins not when the curve inverts, but when it transitions from inverted (negative) to positive [01:29:00]. This is because the Fed's high interest rates signal an economic slowdown, and the market anticipates future rate cuts [01:29:00].

### Chicago Manufacturing PMI
The Chicago Manufacturing Index (PMI), a leading indicator of industrial activity, has plummeted below 50, indicating economic contraction [01:29:00]. Levels like the current 35 have historically coincided with economic recessions, as seen in the 1990s, 2000, and 2007-2008 [01:29:00]. This suggests caution, especially as the current consensus is against a recession [01:29:00].

### Fed Interest Rates
The market is largely betting on Fed rate cuts [01:29:00]. Historically, the Fed has begun lowering rates within 4-8 months after stopping hikes [01:29:00]. Currently, 10 months have passed since the last hike [01:29:00]. If rates are not lowered in 2024, it would be an unusually long period [01:29:00]. The speaker believes rate cuts will occur once inflation is controlled and unemployment rises, and GDP data slows [01:29:00]. Harmonized inflation data from Moody's suggests inflation is nearly back to its historical average, and central banks like Canada's and the ECB plan to cut rates this summer [01:29:00].

### Market Bifurcation and Valuations
Despite record-high markets, opportunities exist beyond the "Magnificent Seven" large technology companies [01:29:00]. Bill Ackman, a respected investor, notes the market is "full of ideas" for investors looking beyond mega-tech [01:29:00]. Large tech companies currently trade at almost 30 times earnings, near 2000 tech bubble levels (35-40 times) and 2021 levels (which saw a powerful correction) [01:29:00].

While the "Magnificent Seven" have driven much of the market's rise, their growth contribution is expected to decelerate, with the rest of the market contributing more growth from Q4 onwards [01:29:00]. European stocks trade at 13 times earnings, and S&P Small Caps are at only 14 times earnings, well below their historical average [01:29:00]. The S&P 500, excluding mega-tech, trades at 16-17 times earnings, which is historically high given a complicated year for corporate profits due to interest rate hikes [01:29:00].

This market bifurcation is increasingly evident, with large tech and semiconductor stocks sometimes falling sharply while the rest of the market rises, potentially signaling a broader correction in valuations [01:29:00]. [[valuation_and_performance_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | Valuation]] is crucial for investor returns [01:29:00]. The Russell 2000 (small companies) at 12-13 times earnings suggests 8-10% annual returns, while the S&P 500 at 20-22 times earnings points to lower expected returns [01:29:00].

## Updates on Specific Stocks

### Nvidia (NVDA)
Nvidia continues to publish strong results and maintains a huge competitive advantage with total control over the AI chip market [00:59:02]. Its valuation is 37 times earnings, but the primary risk is whether the current demand for its chips is sustainable long-term and if future chip generations will provide sufficient performance to compel continued investment from major customers like Google and Facebook [00:59:18]. The risk for Nvidia is more fundamental (evolution of profits) rather than solely valuation-based [01:00:17].

### Newlat (NLT)
Newlat, a main position in True Value Compounders funds, received very positive news with the finalization of its acquisition of Princess at a favorable price [01:02:51]. This acquisition significantly reduces risk and was opportunistic, as other private equity bidders withdrew due to high interest rates [01:03:02]. Newlat will become a company invoicing nearly $3 billion annually with a current market valuation of $300 million [01:05:07]. The family management behind Newlat has a track record of buying poorly managed food companies, optimizing costs, and reinvesting profits, with a target of $5 billion in revenue in 3-5 years [01:06:47]. The acquisition is expected to generate $100 million in annual free cash flow in the next four years, making Newlat trade at a very low 3.5 times free cash flow, significantly cheaper than other European food companies [01:09:15]. Mitsubishi, the seller, also invested £50 million in Newlat shares, showing confidence in the management [01:07:45].

### Nagarro (NA9)
Nagarro published strong results, causing a 20%+ single-day stock price increase [01:12:10]. The company maintained its guidance, and its profit margin improved to nearly 16% in Q1, leading management to consider revising guidance upwards [01:13:00]. Nagarro's performance is driven by the shift of IT engineering work to India for better conditions, benefiting companies like Nagarro [01:13:00]. Despite its strong execution and objective of 20-25% annual growth, Nagarro trades at only 8 times EBITDA, significantly discounted compared to similar, lower-quality companies that private equity is acquiring at 15 times EBITDA [01:13:00]. Nagarro's founders aim for the company to be 10-15 times larger in revenue and living standards in the next 5-10 years [01:13:00].

### Teleperformance (TEP)
Teleperformance has positive developments, with a medium-term objective to grow revenue to $15 billion by 2028 from $10 billion currently [01:17:40]. This implies potential earnings of $30 per share next year, significantly higher than market expectations [01:18:01]. Management is focused on increasing the stock price to its deserved level by reducing debt and considering share buybacks [01:18:01]. Net debt is expected to drop to 1.8 or 1.4 times EBITDA by year-end, historically low for the company [01:18:01]. Valued at five to six times next year's earnings, it's very cheap [01:18:01]. Fears about AI impacting content moderation are unfounded; demand is actually relaunching as tech companies like Meta increase investment and still need human content moderation for cultural nuances and complex tasks [01:18:01].

### John Deere (DE)
John Deere is a cyclical growth business [01:25:00]. Currently, it is in a slowing cycle due to rising interest rates and falling food and construction prices [01:25:00]. Sales are estimated to drop by 16% this year [01:25:00]. Farmers and construction companies delay equipment purchases when commodity prices are low, but eventually must replace old, inefficient machinery, leading to new growth cycles [01:25:00]. John Deere's stock has recovered well after past downturns [01:25:00]. Its valuation is currently around its historical average, not indicating a bubble [01:25:00].

### Salesforce (CRM)
Salesforce recently experienced a sharp stock drop due to decelerating growth forecasts [01:22:27]. As a very large company (almost $35 billion in turnover), it faces the "law of big numbers," meaning growth rates naturally slow down [01:22:50]. Client investment has also slowed due to recession fears, Fed policies, inflation, and geopolitical risks, leading to cost reductions [01:23:25]. Salesforce's valuation has returned to its historical average of 20 times free cash flow, which is cheaper than the S&P 500, despite it being a strong business with predictable income, leading customer management software, and competitive advantages [01:23:50].

### Faico (FICO)
Faico, a credit rating company, is an example of a good company currently trading at overvalued multiples [01:28:04]. Its sales have grown by 8%, and profits faster due to margin expansion and price increases [01:28:38]. However, its valuation is at an all-time high over the last 10 years, almost double its usual range, despite high interest rates that should compress multiples [01:28:54].

### Starbucks (SBUX)
Starbucks experienced a significant slowdown, particularly due to issues in China and consumer pressure from rising interest rates and inflation [01:31:30]. Its valuation had dropped to its lowest level in recent years [01:31:40].

## General Investment Principles
Investing involves risk [02:52:00]. Understanding a company's historical performance (e.g., over 10-20 years) is a good first step to identify quality businesses [02:52:00]. However, future performance also depends on current [[valuation_and_performance_of_specific_stocks_and_sectors | valuation]] and the viability and competitive advantage of the business [02:52:00]. In the stock market, what has performed well tends to continue performing well [02:52:00].

Patience and understanding are crucial, especially during market downturns [01:13:00]. Investing in good, cheap companies that consistently generate profits and grow is a winning formula that time tends to validate, even correcting valuation errors [01:13:00]. Conversely, poor-quality, highly leveraged cyclical companies can lead to serious trouble [01:13:00]. The current market environment, with its focus on large tech and "AI" narratives, means many smaller or less visible companies are overlooked, presenting [[investment_opportunities_and_stock_market_analysis | investment opportunities and stock market analysis]] for discerning investors [01:13:00].

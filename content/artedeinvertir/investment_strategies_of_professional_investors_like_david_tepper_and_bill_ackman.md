To learn how to invest effectively, one highly effective method is to study and research the actions of the world's most successful investors, then model and apply their techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. This article examines the approaches of legendary Wall Street figures, [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | David Tepper]] and [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies and portfolio | Bill Ackman]].

## David Tepper's Investment Approach

[[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | David Tepper]] is recognized for having one of the best track records in money management over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00">[00:52:00]</a>. He is considered a Wall Street legend from whom much can be learned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:00">[00:57:00]</a>.

### Background and Track Record
[[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]] began his career at Goldman Sachs, leveraging his relationships to secure the initial capital for his firm, Appaloosa Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. Through successful client money management, he amassed a fortune of $12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. In 2019, he returned all client capital to focus solely on his own investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. Over 30 years of managing client funds, [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]] generated an impressive annual return of 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:00">[01:24:00]</a>. This performance surpasses that of [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] over the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>; an initial investment of $10,000 would have grown to over $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy
[[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]] has a reputation as one of the "bravest printers on Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. Like [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]], he is among the first to buy [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stocks]] during times of market panic, when other investors are hesitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. His limited, yet impactful, television appearances have proven highly effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. He publicly recommended investing in years like 2001, 2009, and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>. His best returns for himself and clients have consistently followed these periods of market panic, allowing him to invest at the most attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

### Market Outlook and Buying Strategy
In a CNBC telephone interview conducted six days before the transcript, [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]] offered his perspective on the market:
*   The market could fall an additional 10-15% if investors continue to panic amidst economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>.
*   However, if the U.S. Congress approves an economic measures package, it could signal the end of the market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. (Notably, these measures were approved two days later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.)

When asked if he was buying shares, [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]] responded with a question: "What shares?" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. This highlights his emphasis on selective [[stock_market_investments and strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>. He advises against investing in just any share, regardless of price drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Instead, investors should focus on "good companies" with solid competitive positions and low debt, as weaker, indebted companies may not survive economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>. These strong companies will emerge stronger, increasing their market share and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:00">[03:48:00]</a>.

[[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]] specifically stated he was buying [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stocks]] in the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:00">[04:09:00]</a>, and large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:26:00">[04:26:00]</a>. These companies meet his criteria of having strong competitive positions and low debt, ensuring their survival and future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Investment Approach

[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_portfolio | Bill Ackman]] is another legendary Wall Street investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>, known for generating annual returns exceeding 16% for his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:00">[05:10:00]</a>. He has built a personal fortune of over $1.6 billion from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Public Profile and Track Record
[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_portfolio | Ackman]] gained recent public attention after Netflix broadcast a documentary he produced about the company Valeant (now Bausch Health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. In this documentary, he explained his fund's bearish position of over $1 billion against Valeant shares due to the company's "bad practices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_portfolio | Ackman]] has a reputation as one of the best investors for navigating bearish periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>. For example, during the 2008 financial crisis, his fund lost only 13%, while the S&P 500 lost nearly 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. Over time, his strategies have yielded a cumulative return of 700% for his clients, significantly outperforming the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:42:00">[05:42:00]</a>.

### Recent Market Stance and Investments
In a special statement to his investors on March 27th (a Friday), [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Bill Ackman]] declared: "I was super bearish but now I'm bullish" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. For this reason, he stated he was aggressively buying shares of Hilton, Restaurant Brands, and Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>.

## Example Stocks Reflecting Investor Strategies

The video provides three examples of [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock]] analysis, aligning with the strategies discussed by [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | David Tepper]] and [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_portfolio | Bill Ackman]].

### Airbus (Ticker: A&R)
*   **Company Profile:** Airbus is a key player in the commercial aviation oligopoly, alongside Boeing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. This market has been dominated by these two companies for 50 years and is expected to continue this way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy Alignment:** This aligns with [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]]'s often-quoted advice to invest in high-quality companies like Airbus when temporary problems offer them at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. It's currently at the "epicenter of the storm" due to current airline market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00">[07:09:00]</a>.
*   **Financials & Outlook:** Airbus has a predictable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>, with an order book of 8,000 aircraft, equivalent to €480 billion or seven years of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a>. Orders placed today have an eight-year delivery wait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.
*   **Debt & Valuation:** It possesses a liquidity surplus of $12 billion (equivalent to 20% of its market capitalization or over €14 per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>, aligning with [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | Tepper]]'s preference for companies with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. Last year, Airbus earned around €6 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:40:00">[09:40:00]</a>. Adjusting for excess liquidity, it trades at a low valuation of only 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:43:00">[09:43:00]</a>. Historically, high-quality, predictable growth companies like Airbus rarely trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:50:00">[09:50:00]</a>. Valuing shares at a P/E of 20 times normalized earnings after the current crisis yields a target of €120 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Looking five years ahead, with expected earnings of €8 per share and a 20x multiple, the valuation could approach €200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>, significantly higher than its current €68 per share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:37:00">[10:37:00]</a>.

### United Healthcare (Ticker: UNH)
*   **Company Profile:** United Healthcare, listed in the U.S., is a leading provider of private healthcare plans in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:49:00">[10:49:00]</a>. The U.S. healthcare market is an oligopoly controlled by four companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy Alignment:** This is identified as one of [[david_einhorn_and_his_investment_strategies | David Tepper]]'s preferred healthcare [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. It's a highly defensive business; people rarely cancel healthcare insurance, even during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.
*   **Track Record:** United Healthcare increased both sales and profits during the 2008 and 2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. Over the last 30 years, its shares have grown from $1 to over $240 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:49:00">[11:49:00]</a>.
*   **Debt & Valuation:** The company has low debt on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. While mature, it's expected to grow at 5-10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. Last year, United Healthcare earned around $15 per share, with expectations to earn over $20 per share in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:06:00">[12:06:00]</a>. High-quality, predictable businesses with low debt and a strong history like United Healthcare should not trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>. Multiplying 20 by the expected future earnings of $21 per share yields a target valuation of over $400 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>, compared to its current price of $240 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:37:00">[12:37:00]</a>.

### Restaurant Brands International (Ticker: RBI)
*   **Company Profile:** Listed in the U.S., Restaurant Brands International (RBI) owns iconic franchises such as Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a>.
*   **Strategy Alignment:** This is one of the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stocks]] [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategies_and_portfolio | Bill Ackman]] is currently buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>. Its shares have fallen 50% from their highs, as restaurant [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stocks]] are currently unpopular due to economic shutdowns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Historically, fast-food [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stocks]] like McDonald's and Burger King have been excellent investments due to increasing out-of-home eating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>. Their low-priced menus make them resilient during economic crises; McDonald's sales even increased in 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. RBI operates on a royalty model, receiving fees from franchisees rather than directly operating restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:43:00">[13:43:00]</a>, which requires less investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. Fast food typically benefits during difficult economic periods by gaining market share from more expensive restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:07:00">[14:07:00]</a>.
*   **Debt & Valuation:** RBI carries some debt, but the sector (including McDonald's, Wendy's, Domino's Pizza) can admit more debt due to its crisis resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>. The U.S. government's stated intent to help small business owners in this sector has reduced perceived risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:55:00">[14:55:00]</a>. RBI generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:07:00">[15:07:00]</a>. Compared to its market capitalization of $11.7 billion, this represents an attractive valuation of 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:00">[15:20:00]</a>. Fast-food restaurant companies rarely trade below 15 times earnings; McDonald's, for instance, traded at 14-15 times earnings during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook:** Once the economy recovers, sales and earnings are expected to return to previous levels of $2.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:48:00">[15:48:00]</a>. Valuing this at 15 times earnings suggests a target value of $80 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:57:00">[15:57:00]</a>. RBI plans to grow from 26,000 to 40,000 restaurants over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:12:00">[16:12:00]</a>. This could increase profits from $1.4 billion to $2 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. Applying the same 15x multiple to these future profits, a target value of $120 per share could be achieved in 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:27:00">[16:27:00]</a>, offering attractive potential compared to the current $40 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>.

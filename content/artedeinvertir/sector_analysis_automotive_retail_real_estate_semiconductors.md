## Automotive Sector

The automotive sector is considered a leading indicator for the economy [00:09:49]. Historically, during crises like that of 1929, people stopped buying cars at the onset of the crisis. Conversely, car sales began to recover even when unemployment and other indicators still suggested a bad economy [00:09:53].

Recent developments confirm the sector's predictive nature:
*   **Carmax**, one of the largest used car sellers, reported disastrous results, with its stock down more than 20% [00:10:06]. This indicates consumer pressure due to inflation and the beginning of the dismantling of a "car bubble" seen last year [00:10:15]. This confirms early symptoms of a possible recession and a drop in corporate profits [00:10:27].
*   **LKQ**, a car scrapping business, is noted as a resilient business. Its services are consistently needed regardless of whether cars are electric or not [00:47:36]. This makes it a predictable business due to the constant need for waste management and parts [00:47:57]. LKQ's profits only saw a temporary dip during the COVID-19 lockdown when people couldn't drive their cars [00:48:22]. The company treats its shareholders well with buybacks and dividends [00:48:36]. Its valuation has dropped to 11 times earnings, while its historical average is 16 times [00:48:45].

Regarding high-end automotive brands:
*   The **Porsche IPO** is being compared to Ferrari, but it is not as luxurious [01:14:06].
*   Volkswagen's holding company released only a small portion (10-12%) of Porsche shares, which is not a full spin-off and generates less value [01:14:24]. Consequently, Volkswagen shares went down instead of up [01:14:54].
*   Although Porsche is theoretically worth more than the entire Volkswagen group, the market struggles to recognize this value due to the lack of true separation and independent control [01:15:04]. The market dislikes that Porsche cannot be taken over by another company [01:15:16].
*   Porsche's primary revenue comes from SUVs and sedans (Cayenne, Macan, Panamera) rather than sports cars [01:17:51].
*   In contrast, [[Investment opportunities and analysis of Tesla Uber and AstraZeneca | Ferrari's]] profits are expected to rise significantly due to its new SUV model, the Purosangue [01:18:18]. Lamborghini's Urus SUV already accounts for 50% of its profit [01:18:49].
*   Historically, Volkswagen's attempt with the Audi IPO in the early 2000s also failed to add value and was eventually bought back by the parent company [01:20:07].

## Retail Sector

The retail sector also acts as an advanced indicator of economic conditions [00:10:35].
*   **Nike** announced very poor results, with its stock dropping over 60% from its peak [00:10:37].
*   **Adidas** also reported bad results [00:10:46].
*   **Walmart** indicated it had excessive unsold inventory and plans to lower prices to move it [00:10:50].
*   Nike specifically plans to apply significant discounts, especially in North America, to clear inventory before Christmas [00:15:35]. This strategy impacted shares forcefully [00:15:50].
*   Nike's 53% drop from its highs is almost greater than its decline during the 2008 financial crisis [00:38:31]. The company made a mistake by removing inventory from Foot Locker, aiming to sell directly, which complicated inventory management and sales performance [00:38:45]. Nike's stock is now near its March 2020 lockdown lows [00:39:12].
*   Historically, Nike's price-to-earnings ratio typically ranged from 20 to 30 times, but last year it reached peaks of 45-50 times earnings [00:39:37]. Despite the recent plummet, it remains at around 26 times earnings [00:39:51].
*   **Adidas** has dropped 62% from its highs, listed in Germany, and is affected by negative news, rising costs due to inflation, supply chain issues, and past exposure to Russia [00:42:01]. Its valuation was high last year, trading at over 22 times EV/EBITDA, equivalent to about 40 times earnings [00:43:21]. It is now trading at 8 times EV/EBITDA, which is around its 2008 crisis levels [00:43:45]. Adidas's business model, based on brand and reputation, is considered resilient [00:45:00].
*   **Pandora**, a jewelry company, is an example of a business that can reach saturation points and lacks strong competitive advantages [01:33:01]. Its growth decelerated significantly before the lockdown, leading to a compression in valuation [01:33:48]. While it saw a resurgence during 2021-2022 as people spent more on products, the long-term sustainability of this growth is uncertain [01:34:25].

## Real Estate Sector

The [[real_estate_sector_analysis | real estate sector]] is another advance indicator of economic health [01:10:59].
*   Latest data shows housing prices in the United States are beginning to drop significantly [01:11:10].
*   Inventories, another leading indicator, are experiencing increases of over 90% in previously overheated states like Arizona, Texas, and Florida [01:11:16]. This signals excess supply and downward pressure on prices [01:11:34].
*   In Europe, particularly Spain, the economy typically lags behind the United States [01:11:39]. While there was recent euphoria, real estate investments with normalized rates are yielding only 2-3% [01:12:00]. If 30-year mortgage rates rise to 5-6% (currently at 7% in the US [01:16:30]), these numbers do not work, potentially leading to price drops of 30-50% [01:12:22].
*   In Canada, the [[real_estate_sector_analysis | real estate market]] is even more overvalued [01:17:12]. Property prices peaked in August, and many cities have seen double-digit declines (over 10%) from their peaks [01:17:16]. The current fall is more pronounced than in 2008 [01:17:33].

## Semiconductor Sector

The semiconductor sector is also important for measuring the economy, with an index called the SOX [01:29:50].
*   **Micron** published "terrible results," lowering its profit outlook by 26% for the next quarter, with operating profit forecasts dropping by 90% [01:13:01]. This implies the company will practically stop making money [01:14:13].
*   Semiconductors are used in discretionary consumer products like smartphones, PCs, and even refrigerators [01:14:31]. When the economy weakens, people think twice before buying new electronics, making it one of the first expenses they cut [01:14:45]. This contrasts with essential sectors like healthcare or consumer staples (e.g., toothpaste), which are not leading indicators because people will continue to pay for them regardless of the economy [01:15:11].

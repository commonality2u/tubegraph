[[Michael Burry's investment style and achievements | Dr. Michael Burry]] is renowned as one of the best investors, having gained significant personal wealth by being among the first to predict the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His fame grew thanks to the movie *The Big Short*, produced by Brad Pitt and starring Christian Bale as Burry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The film was nominated for five Oscars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. After years out of the public eye, Burry gave an interview to the *O Barnes* newspaper, where he warned of a potential new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Background and Early Career <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

Michael Burry was originally a doctor by profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. In the late 1990s, he started combining his medical work with his passion for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. He actively shared his investment ideas and positive results on various internet forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This activity led some investors to offer him $1 million to start his own investment fund, which became Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

### Scion Capital's Initial Success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>
During its first five years, Scion Capital invested almost exclusively in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. The fund achieved impressive results:
*   **Year 1 (2001)**: Generated an 8% return while the S&P 500 fell 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.
*   **Year 2 (2002)**: Generated a 55% return while the S&P 500 fell 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
*   **Year 3 (2003)**: Generated a 16% return while the S&P 500 fell 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.

These results attracted a large influx of capital, allowing him to manage over $500 million for clients in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

### The Big Short Bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>
In 2006, as depicted in *The Big Short*, Burry radically changed his investment style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He shifted from buying stocks to betting his entire fund against an impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This period was challenging as his bet initially did not pay off, making investors nervous about the fund's radical new focus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. However, the crisis became evident in 2007 and 2008, resulting in enormous benefits from his large bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

[[Michael Burry's stock movements and market predictions | Scion Capital]] achieved a 160% return in 2007 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>, solidifying Burry's legendary status in the investment industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. He generated over $700 million in profits for his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a> and his personal fortune quickly exceeded $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. Scion Capital achieved an accumulated return of 700% annually for its clients, making it one of the most successful funds during its operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.

[[Investment strategies and advice from Michael Burry | Burry's story]] is particularly motivating because he is an ordinary person who succeeded in the financial industry without formal stock market education, contacts, or prior experience, relying solely on effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Current Investment Portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:35">[03:19:35]</a>
[[Overview of Michael Burry's significant stock picks | Michael Burry]] has concentrated his current stock portfolio in just six stocks, representing a net worth of approximately $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:20">[03:20:20]</a>.

### GameStop (28% Weighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:45:00">[03:45:00]</a>
GameStop is the leading company in video game and entertainment product sales in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>. Its shares have significantly declined, falling from $45 to $5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>, largely due to the shift from physical store purchases to online channels in the video game and entertainment sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Burry is an active shareholder, proposing significant management changes that could benefit shareholders and lead to a regularization of GameStop shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. This investment carries a certain risk and is considered daring, but if online sales issues are resolved, the shares could perform significantly in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>.

### Tailored Brands (22% Weighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>
Tailored Brands specializes in men's fashion and accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. After strong growth in the 2000s, the company has seen stagnation in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:00">[04:59:00]</a>. Burry's investment in Tailored Brands highlights his strategy of betting on the retail sector and stocks trading at historical lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:00">[05:04:00]</a>. The shares trade at an attractive P/E ratio of five times next year's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a>.

### Google (16% Weighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:00">[05:18:00]</a>
Google represents the type of high-quality company available at historically good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>. Burry enjoys mixing contrarian stocks, which are unpopular and undervalued, with high-quality stocks trading at reasonable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. Google fits this description as a high-quality company at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. The stock was trading at $1,100 at one point and is currently at $1,300 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>.

### Portman Warehouse (14% Weighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a>
Portman Warehouse is another retail company in Burry's portfolio, selling items related to outdoor sports, including climbing, camping, hunting, and firearms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:00">[06:07:00]</a>. The company has shown solid growth, mainly due to the strong performance of the outdoor sports niche market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. It is estimated that Burry invested around $4 per share, and it currently trades at $8 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. It remains in his portfolio due to its attractive valuation of only 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>.

### Bed Bath & Beyond (13% Weighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>
Bed Bath & Beyond sells household items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:47:00">[06:47:00]</a>. This is another retail company in a currently unfashionable sector, heavily impacted in the stock market but offering attractive valuations with certain risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a>. The main threat to such companies comes from online sales, particularly from Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>. Despite the pressure, the shares are offered at an attractive price of seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Canadian Natural Resources (8% Weighting) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:21:00">[07:21:00]</a>
Canadian Natural Resources is Canada's largest oil producer, with a production of one million barrels per day and a market capitalization exceeding $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>. The company is a pioneer in oil sands technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>, an innovative process to extract oil from sand through a mining and chemical process, which can be profitable on a large, automated industrial scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

The company's pioneering efforts in this process and other quality assets contributed to its stock price rising quickly from $4 to $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>. It is considered one of the most solid raw materials companies, having increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>. Currently, these dividends yield 4% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>. Due to the negativity surrounding the energy sector, the market offers these shares at a very attractive valuation of only seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:54:00">[08:54:00]</a>.

## Keys to Michael Burry's Investment Style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>
Based on his early writings in forums and blogs, [[Michael Burry's investment strategy | Michael Burry's investment style]] can be summarized by three main pieces of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:28:00">[09:28:00]</a>:

### 1. Buying Ignored Companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>
Burry's investment strategy is straightforward:
> "My investment strategy is not very complex. I try to buy shares in ignored companies when it seems that they are going to go bankrupt and I sell them when they have improved slightly. The management of my portfolio is so important like company selection if I can do both well I will be successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00">[09:38:00]</a>.

This explains his strong preference for the retail and energy sectors in his current portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. These are typically out-of-favor sectors where cheap companies are abundant, and if conditions improve, significant regularizations could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

### 2. Concentrated Portfolio Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:14:00">[10:14:00]</a>
Burry prefers a concentrated portfolio:
> "I like to have between 12 and 18 stocks in my portfolio, depressed industries. I tend to always be invested this number of positions, I feel it gives me room to have my best ideas while smoothing out volatility so as not to confuse portfolio volatility with portfolio risk and he adds ironically you know I have this problem at heart and I don't want to have extra stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

A portfolio with fewer than 25 stocks is generally considered concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. This approach aligns with other great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, who advocated for concentrating investments in high-conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>.

### 3. Adding Quality Companies at Good Prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>
He is also willing to include high-quality companies:
> "I'm also delighted to add to the portfolio the companies that Warren Buffett likes with a competitive advantage, high return on capital if the market offers them at good prices." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:05:00">[11:05:00]</a>

This highlights his investment in Google, a classic example of a good company with a competitive advantage that Warren Buffett would approve of, especially when quoted at an attractive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>. This demonstrates Burry's flexibility as an investor, enabling him to quickly pursue both contrarian ideas and more popular companies when they are reasonably priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:00">[11:24:00]</a>.

The current [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market bubble]] and its potential end date, as well as specific [[analysis_of_specific_stocks_and_market_opportunities | investment opportunities]], have been highlighted by David Einhorn, a respected investor [00:00:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Einhorn is known for his average annual returns exceeding 15% [00:00:07](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> and his accurate prediction of Lehman Brothers' fall, which preceded a major financial crisis [00:00:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In a recent letter to investors, Einhorn, also referred to as Vicens Hong in the transcript, specified the exact date he believes the current stock market bubble will end and how he plans to profit by focusing "bearish bets" on popular stocks like Tesla and Amazon [00:00:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## Vicens Hong's Background and Investment Approach

Vicens Hong, considered one of the most talented investors, has accumulated over a billion dollars in personal wealth by investing his own and clients' money [00:01:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. He started from scratch in 1996, founding his first investment fund, Greenlight, at 28 with a capital of $800,000 [00:01:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This fund grew from managing $1 million to over $12 billion [00:01:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

He is also an expert poker player, having participated in the World Series of Poker, finishing 28th among over 10,000 participants in 2006 [00:01:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. He donated over $650,000 of his winnings to the Michael J. Fox Foundation for Alzheimer's research [00:01:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Vicens Hong is a "long-short" investor, meaning he invests for the long term in stocks he believes are undervalued or have strong prospects, while simultaneously investing against (shorting) stocks he believes are overvalued or have poor prospects [00:02:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. This strategy aims to produce satisfactory results in any market environment, even in bear markets, as short investments can support the portfolio's general behavior [00:02:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

### Notable Past Successes

Vicens Hong has a history of important market predictions and successful investments:
*   **Lehman Brothers (2008)**: Five months before its bankruptcy in September 2008, he warned of the bank's account manipulation and the systemic risk it posed [00:02:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. His short position yielded high profits [00:03:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The financial director publicly called him a liar for these revelations [00:03:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.
*   **Allied Capital**: He made significant profits by uncovering the Allied Capital fraud case [00:03:38](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Wirecard**: He alerted investors about Wirecard, a German technology company that lost over 95% of its market value due to a fraud scandal [00:03:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

His conservative approach has allowed him to navigate previous [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market bubbles]], such as those in 2000 and 2007 [00:03:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Vicens Hong's Prediction for the Current Bubble

In a recent letter, Vicens Hong stated that the market is in the middle of a "huge technological bubble" [00:04:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He ventured to give an exact date for the end of the bubble, which is unusual for him [00:02:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

> "Our working hypothesis tells us that September 2nd, 2020, marked the market ceiling and that the bubble has already begun to deflate. Investor sentiment is changing from greed to complacency. We have adjusted our portfolio according to this hypothesis, adding short positions in many low-quality stocks that are trading at very high valuations." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>

He has never been so specific in his 25 years of investing [00:04:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. The Nasdaq index, which he considers overvalued, reached highs of 12,500 on September 2nd, 2020, and has not touched that level since [00:05:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

## [[Key indicators of stock market bubbles | Key Indicators of the Current Technological Bubble]]

Vicens Hong outlines several reasons why he believes the market is experiencing a large technological bubble:

### High Number of IPOs
*   Historically, a high number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) correlates with changes in the market cycle [00:05:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   There is currently high investor appetite for new technological companies, with revaluations often exceeding 200% on the first day of IPO [00:05:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>.

### High Number of Unprofitable Listed Companies
*   An impressive 80% of companies listed on the stock market are currently unprofitable [00:05:58](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   This surpasses the record set during the previous technological bubble in 2000 [00:06:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

### High Degree of Speculation
*   The market exhibits a high degree of speculation [00:06:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   As an example, Hertz, a car rental company that went bankrupt, saw its shares propelled by investors from $1 to $5 after announcing bankruptcy [00:06:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The American regulator (SEC) had to intervene to prevent the company from selling worthless shares [00:06:49](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   In a normal market, bankrupt companies' share prices drop and remain low; however, investors are lining up to buy shares of bankrupt companies [00:07:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>. The number of investors holding Hertz shares in one US brokerage tripled from 40,000 to over 140,000 after its bankruptcy announcement [00:07:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Unusual Stock Performance Post-Split
*   Popular stocks have seen great performance immediately after announcing a stock split [00:07:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
*   A stock split is a neutral event that does not add value to a company [00:07:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
*   Examples: Tesla shares revalued by over 50% after announcing a split [00:07:59](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>, and Apple shares revalued by over 30% after its split [00:08:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. This behavior would not be usual in a rational market [00:08:09](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

## Bearish Bets and [[Market valuation concerns and potential stock market bubble | Market Valuation Concerns]]

Vicens Hong has invested against certain well-known stocks, including Amazon and Tesla [00:00:33](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Amazon (AMZN)
*   Amazon is listed at $3,200 per share [00:08:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>.
*   Vicens Hong acknowledges Amazon as a great company [00:08:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a> but considers its current stock market valuation "excessive" due to its recent rapid rise [00:08:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   Amazon's sales grew 37%, and operating cash flow grew over 56%, indicating operating leverage [00:09:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   The best ratio for valuing technology companies is EV/EBITDA [00:09:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Amazon's historical average valuation in the last five years is around 26 times EBITDA [00:09:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   Estimated EBITDA for 2020 is over $54 billion, projected to grow above $100 billion in the next three years [00:09:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.
*   Valuing it at its historical average of 26x EBITDA would suggest a price of $5,200 per share in the future [00:09:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. While this is higher than its current $3,200, it's significantly higher than the $1,700 it was listed at a year prior [00:09:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA)
*   Tesla is listed at $420 per share, and Vicens Hong has invested against it [00:12:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
*   There's a public rivalry between Vicens Hong and Elon Musk [00:12:55](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Musk has publicly ridiculed Einhorn as Tesla shares have risen, causing losses to Greenlight Capital [00:13:03](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>.
*   Conversely, Vicens Hong has publicly accused Tesla of manipulating its accounts to artificially inflate profits and playing with investor expectations [00:13:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>.
*   In a Q2 2020 letter, he stated that Musk participated in "one of the most alarming manipulation scandals in recent history" and was fined an insignificant amount by the SEC [00:13:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:27">[00:13:27]</a>.
*   He claims Tesla is artificially increasing income through sales of "cars that do not exist" and leveraging future tax credits to boost current reported profits [00:13:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   Tesla is expected to earn $3 per share in 2021, trading at over 140 times earnings [00:14:12](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   He advises that such a demanding valuation requires a deep understanding of the investment to determine if earnings can drastically increase [00:14:23](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, otherwise, it's better to stay out [00:14:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. Investing against an overvalued stock can be very dangerous, as Einhorn has experienced [00:14:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

## Bullish Investments and [[Investment opportunities and stock market analysis | Opportunities]]

Beyond his bearish positions, Vicens Hong has also made significant long-term investments where he is optimistic about the future. These contribute to his [[analysis_of_the_stock_market_environment | analysis of the stock market environment]].

### VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX)
*   Vicens Hong recently bought over $67 million in shares of the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), listed at $40 per share, to benefit from a potential rise in gold [00:10:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   He cites the extensive money printing by both Democratic and Republican parties (over $3.3 trillion in 2020 alone, representing 22% of all dollars in circulation in 2019) as a key reason for gold's expected positive performance [00:11:15](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>.
*   This money printing generates inflation, which is positive for gold's behavior in the stock market [00:11:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   The GDX ETF appreciated over 50% in the last 12 months due to global money printing to combat the crisis [00:11:53](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While valuing gold ETFs is complex due to their speculative nature, continued money printing is expected to lead to rising inflation and strong gold performance [00:12:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Green Brick Partners (GRBK)
*   Vicens Hong has invested an impressive 31% of his portfolio ($280 million) in Green Brick Partners (GRBK), a residential home builder listed at $21 per share [00:15:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. His fund, Greenlight Capital, controls 48% of the company's circulating shares [00:15:18](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
*   The company operates in Atlanta and Texas, two of the fastest-growing regions in the US [00:15:35](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>.
*   The construction sector is experiencing significant growth due to low interest rates set by central banks, and Green Brick is well-capitalized to capture this growth [00:15:42](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:42">[00:15:42]</a>.
*   Demand for housing outside urban centers is increasing dramatically, a market niche where Green Brick operates [00:15:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   The company's profit before taxes increased by over 100% compared to the same period in 2019 [00:16:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   Green Brick has tripled its profits in the last four years and still trades at a reasonable valuation [00:16:19](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   Compared to competitors, Green Brick has the greatest growth, highest profit margins, and least debt [00:16:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:28">[00:16:28]</a>.
*   It's estimated that Green Brick could earn $3 per share in the next two years [00:17:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Historically, homebuilders have traded at a P/E ratio of 12 [00:17:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. Multiplying $3 earnings by 12 times earnings suggests a future valuation of $36, presenting a significant potential realization compared to its current $21 [00:17:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This potential gain is a primary reason for Einhorn's substantial investment [00:17:30](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:30">[00:17:30]</a>.

### General Investment Advice

Investors should learn to listen to different points of view to grow [00:10:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. A key factor for success in investing is having one's own convictions [00:10:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. All information shared is for educational purposes, aiming to teach how to invest independently [00:14:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>, and investors must be responsible for their own buy or sell decisions [00:15:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

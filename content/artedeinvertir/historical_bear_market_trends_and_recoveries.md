Michael Burry, a renowned investor known from "The Big Short," has issued a warning that the current market crisis has "only just begun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He has provided a predicted level for the stock market's bottom, suggesting a significant further decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Burry became famous for accurately predicting and profiting from the dot-com bubble crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>, the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, and even the 2020 market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. He has consistently generated over 20% annual returns managing his own money over the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. After reactivating his Twitter account, Burry warned about impending inflation, rising interest rates, and bubbles in growth stocks and cryptocurrencies, which have largely materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Characteristics of Bear Markets

### Bear Market Rallies
A key characteristic of bear markets, as described by Burry, is the occurrence of "bear market rallies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These are temporary bounces in the stock market during a downtrend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Many investors mistake these rebounds for the end of the crisis, leading them to buy, only for the market to fall again <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:49]</a>.

The 2020 crisis was atypical, with a V-shaped recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This created a "positive reinforcement" for investors to "buy the dip," an approach that is not usual in typical bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:16]</a>. In contrast, historical crises like those in 2000 and 1929 saw ten or more false recovery attempts, or bear market rallies exceeding 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:32]</a>. The dot-com bubble, which Burry sees as having many similarities to the current situation, featured frequent rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Investor Psychology and Capital Flows
Bear market rallies are often driven by investor psychology, where masses of people mistakenly believe the worst is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:43]</a>. According to George Soros, the most significant losses in bubbles occur not among those who bought at the peak, but among those who repeatedly buy "on the decline" during these false recoveries, greatly increasing their positions as the market continues to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:29]</a>. Many high-growth or bubble stocks that collapsed 70-90% from their peak last year are examples of this phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:07]</a>.

A key indicator of a market bottom in bear markets is significant capital outflow due to widespread desperation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Historically, capital outflows mark the end of bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:59]</a>. As of the time of the recording, some market segments were still experiencing capital inflows, suggesting the bottom had not yet been reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:50]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Market Predictions

Based on his analysis, Burry estimates that bear markets typically end 13% to 17% below the previous crisis's low point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:17]</a>. He believes the current market is still in a bull market cycle, despite recent declines, which were interrupted by COVID <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:29]</a>.

Burry predicts the S&P 500 could bottom out at a Price-to-Earnings (PER) ratio of 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:39]</a>, a valuation level last seen at the market bottom in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:47]</a>. This would align with being 15% below the virus-induced minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:54]</a>, and 10% below the previous maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:03]</a>. This translates to an S&P 500 target of 1,860 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:09]</a>, signifying an additional 50% drop from current levels based on current S&P 500 average earnings of $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:30]</a>. He emphasizes that this valuation model is crucial, as profits often fall during a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Influence of Macroeconomic Factors

### Central Bank Policy (The Fed)
The actions of central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed), are determining factors in the short and medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:43]</a>. The Fed's aggressive tightening of economic conditions could lead to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:44]</a>. The Fed's message is clear: they will continue raising rates to control inflation, even rumors suggest they might welcome a recession to cool things down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:13:13]</a>.

### Inflation and Bond Yields
Inflation is a significant concern, with Paul Tudor Jones suggesting it will take longer than expected to control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:34]</a>. When adjusting S&P 500 returns for inflation, the real losses appear more severe, indicating a high level of pessimism in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:26:00]</a>.

The yield of the 10-year US Treasury bond acts as a "force of gravity" on stock valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:30:08]</a>. When bond yields rise, it pulls down stock valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:51">[00:30:56]</a>. Companies with higher risk, or those not producing profits, are most affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:59">[00:31:06]</a>.

## Investment Strategies During Bear Markets

### Building Liquidity
Michael Burry's portfolio adjustments reflect his bearish outlook. He has significantly reduced his invested value, suggesting a move towards creating liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:19]</a>. This means holding a substantial amount of cash to capitalize on future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:17:19]</a>.

### Defensive Stocks
Burry has concentrated his remaining investments in very defensive stocks, with three companies making up almost 75% of his limited portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:53]</a>.

*   **Bristol Myers (Pharmaceuticals):** This is a healthcare company, which is generally resistant to crises and inflation because healthcare products are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:53">[00:43:07]</a>. Bristol Myers is trading below its historical average valuation, focusing on share buybacks and dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:09">[00:46:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:57">[00:47:24]</a>. This aligns with Warren Buffett's preference for companies that generate significant cash flow and return it to shareholders during inflationary times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:42">[00:45:15]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics (Defense):** A defense company that has performed well during market downturns, possibly due to increased government defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:07">[00:49:50]</a>. Despite modest growth, it is perceived as secure, causing people to pay above its historical average valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:26">[00:50:00]</a>. Defense companies often possess strong competitive advantages due to their specialized products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:43">[00:53:49]</a>.

### Long-Term Perspective
Historically, the average bear market decline in the S&P 500 has been around 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:32]</a>. Recoveries have typically occurred within a year and a half, excluding the deepest crises (like 1929, 2000, 2008) which took longer, about four years on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:20]</a>.

Buying during these declines has historically been a good decision, even if a larger fall follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:53]</a>. It's impossible to perfectly time the market bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:58">[00:20:00]</a>.

> "The attitude you take in these key moments of the stock market in the next months or even years... is going to determine the rest of your career in the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:46]</a>.

[[Strategies for investing during bear markets | Investing during bear markets]] requires patience and a long-term mindset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:07">[00:52:12]</a>. Warren Buffett built most of his fortune in the last 20-30 years, despite investing for 70, thanks to compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:21:03]</a>. Many investors lose money during downturns and abandon the stock market, which is a significant mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:15">[00:21:20]</a>. Facing bear markets "bravely" can lead to becoming "invincible" in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:58">[00:22:09]</a>.

> "In a bear market, every purchase you make is a mistake, and every sale you've made will seem like a success" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:25">[00:23:33]</a>.

This feeling is a symptom of being in a bear market, indicating that the valley is approaching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:38">[00:23:43]</a>. Significant drops in indices like the Nasdaq (over 25%) and Russell 2000 (almost 27%) signal important bear markets, which are rare [[opportunities and risks in investing during bear markets | opportunities]] that occur every five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:45">[00:24:04]</a>.

### Avoiding Speculative Investments
Jim Chanos notes that unlike previous bubbles where overvalued stocks were identifiable, the current bubble has seen absurdly high market capitalizations (30-40 billion dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:14:04]</a>. Sectors like cryptocurrencies also reached valuations similar to the 2000 dot-com bubble (2 trillion dollars) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:52]</a>. Many high-growth, unprofitable companies with high stock-option compensation are facing a "tsunami" as investors pull back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:30]</a>.

Investors should avoid buying stocks purely based on liking the company or brand, especially at high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:47">[01:02:56]</a>. Instead, focus on understanding the business model, debt levels, and capacity to generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:40">[01:31:54]</a>. The "real risk" in the stock market is permanent loss of capital, not temporary volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:27">[01:30:33]</a>.

### Conclusion: Importance of Education
Investing in the stock market is a powerful mechanism for wealth generation but requires long-term commitment and education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:55]</a>. Education is the best investment you can make, empowering you to make sensible decisions and navigate difficult market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:39">[01:47:44]</a>. This knowledge allows investors to capitalize on opportunities that arise during bear markets, positioning themselves for future gains when the market recovers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:18">[01:48:22]</a>.

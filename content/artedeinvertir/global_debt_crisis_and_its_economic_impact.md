Global aid has reached record levels following the 2020 crisis, potentially leading to serious consequences for both the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Prominent investors such as [[Ray Dalio]] and [[Warren Buffett]] have issued warnings regarding this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Understanding this situation is crucial for anyone with investments or debts, as it provides insights into protection and potential benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Alarming Levels of Global Debt

Global aid has rapidly grown to alarming levels in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. According to data from the Institute of International Finance, the total global debt—summing corporate, government, and individual/family debt—stands at a staggering 270 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the global gross domestic product (GDP) of just 80 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This means every person on Earth owes more than 35,000 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. The 2020 crisis has exacerbated this, pushing debt levels to new records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stated that when a government's debt surpasses 77% of its GDP, it significantly impacts future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Unfortunately, most developed countries, including Spain, Europe, and the [[United States debt and its consequences | USA]], have already exceeded this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. These record debt levels coincide with historically low-interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A key question arises: what will happen when interest rates inevitably rise, forcing individuals, corporations, and governments to service this vast debt at a much higher cost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>?

## The Phenomenon of Negative Interest Rates

Over the past five years, the global economy has witnessed an unusual occurrence: negative interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, a phenomenon seen only once before in 300 years of economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Central banks have consistently lowered rates to combat crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. However, having reached zero, they lack further room to maneuver, raising concerns about responses to future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

This situation has inverted traditional finance, where people effectively pay to lend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For example, lending to the German government via 10-year bonds with a negative yield of 0.6% annually guarantees a loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. Despite this, demand for such debt bonds, in both dollars and euros, remains extremely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

### Speculation in the Debt Market

The apparent paradox of investing in negative-yield bonds stems from the fact that these bonds are actively traded on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. While holding them to maturity ensures a loss, if their negative yield becomes *even more* negative due to market conditions or central bank actions, their price on the stock market rises, allowing for speculative profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. This resembles "Russian roulette," where the end consequences are catastrophic, but short-term speculation yields gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The debt market is significantly larger than the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. In the U.S. alone, the debt market is estimated at 40 trillion dollars, double the stock market's 20 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Daily trading volume in debt is around 700 million dollars, compared to just 200 billion dollars for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Therefore, developments in the debt market will profoundly impact both stocks and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Data from the Financial Times shows that debt with negative interest rates has skyrocketed since 2015, reaching a global figure of 17 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Consequences of Debt Crises

Crises stemming from high debt levels tend to be the most severe within the current economic system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Credit acts as the "lung of the economy"; if it stops flowing, the economy halts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis, fueled by sub-prime mortgage debt, had severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, unlike the milder 2000 tech bubble crisis which did not involve significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

[[Ray Dalio]], manager of the world's largest investment fund, known for anticipating major macroeconomic events, warns that the world will be "very different" in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. He emphasizes that once interest rates hit 0%, asset prices lose their primary driver, and central banks' economic stimulus tools become ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Dalio suggests that the stock market and markets will have a greater effect on the economy than the economy on the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If the debt market declines, global credit flows will cease, initiating economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Debt crises are typically triggered by aggressive increases in interest rates, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Central banks have recently issued large amounts of new money to address the 2020 crisis, which is expected to cause inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Inflation is the primary variable central banks monitor when considering interest rate hikes to balance the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Therefore, future inflation, due to extensive money printing, could trigger a fall in the debt market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Monitoring inflation is critical for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

## Adapting to the New Economic Situation

### For Debt Holders

If you have long-term debts, it's ideal to secure them at a fixed rate to capitalize on today's low-interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Should inflation arise, the value of assets like homes would increase, while fixed-rate debt costs would remain stable, leading to a favorable financial outcome <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. For short-term debts with high interest rates (e.g., credit cards at 25-30% annually), refinancing with personal loans at lower rates (8-12%) is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### The Importance of Saving

Saving is universally advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When credit flow ceases, liquidity becomes the most valuable asset, enabling investments at unprecedented prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### For Investors

1.  **Avoid Highly Indebted Companies**: If interest rates rise, highly indebted companies will face increased costs and could go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This risk is amplified for cyclical businesses like banks, construction companies, or airlines, which are highly sensitive to economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. While some believe banks benefit from rising rates, increased delinquency (loan defaults) is also a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. [[Warren Buffett]] has begun reducing his banking sector investments due to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.
    *   To assess a company's financial situation, check its annual report (financial balance sheet for cash and debt) or use websites like `marketscreener.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

2.  **Avoid Investing with Debt**: When market opportunities arise, credit will primarily flow to solvent investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. It is then opportune to incur debt to seize these opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. [[Warren Buffett]] has been accumulating record levels of liquidity, with Berkshire Hathaway holding an impressive 140 billion dollars in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This cash reserve provides significant value for future problems and opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

3.  **Invest in Companies with Strong Liquidity, Attractive Valuation, and Growth Potential**:
    Companies that grow through acquisitions, like Berkshire Hathaway, will find more buying opportunities at better prices during a crisis, with less competition due to restricted credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. [[Warren Buffett]] has repeatedly employed this strategy during crises, including in 2000, 2002, and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

4.  **Consider Investing Against Bonds/Debt (High Risk)**:
    While complex and high-risk, inverse debt ETFs provide a way for investors to bet against bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **LTEFE (ProShares)**: Ticker TVEFE, listed at $15 per share, targets the 20-year American debt bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Its performance has been poor due to high maintenance costs if the debt market does not fall within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
    *   **LT EFE (DWS)**: Ticker XSVD, listed at 65 euros per share, for the European debt market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. Its behavior has also been unsatisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Stocks

Here are three examples of investment opportunities that meet the mentioned criteria and could perform well even without a debt crisis:

### 1. Cisco Systems (CSCO)
*   **Ticker**: CSCO (U.S. market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>
*   **Price**: $44 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>
*   **Overview**: A leading company in technological infrastructure products, with stable sales highly resistant to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. It has been one of the best tech stocks of the last 30 years, multiplying its value by over 200 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.
*   **Financial Health**: Possesses significant liquidity, is debt-free, and has a very stable business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. For 2021, it is projected to have over 17 trillion dollars of debt-free liquidity, valuable for acquisitions, business investment, or share buybacks during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Expected to earn around $3 per share in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. As a mature company with limited growth potential, its earnings per share might increase to $4 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Valued at 15 times earnings, its target price is $60 per share, offering limited but stable potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.

### 2. Constellation Software (CSU)
*   **Ticker**: CSU (Canadian market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>
*   **Price**: $1,600 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>
*   **Overview**: One of the best technology stocks, multiplying by over 80 times on the stock market in the last 12 years, yielding an average annual return over 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. The True Valió investment fund first bought shares in 2014 at $200 per share, which have since multiplied by over 8 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.
*   **Characteristics for Debt Crisis**:
    1.  Large amount of liquidity on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    2.  Growth based on acquisitions, meaning more abundant and attractive acquisitions in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    3.  Very resilient business model, ensuring acquired businesses perform well during economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Crisis Performance**: During the 2006-2011 crisis, its income grew from 200 million to over 700 million dollars, with spectacular growth rates even in 2008-2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Gross profit also doubled, from 120 million to over 260 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Future growth rate confirmed to be lower than in the past, but still potentially 15% on average per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. If shares maintain their current reasonable valuation, they could reach $3,000 per share, offering a 15% average annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. It is a safe and stable company with potential additional upside during a debt crisis, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>.

### 3. Oracle (ORCL)
*   **Ticker**: ORCL (U.S. market) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>
*   **Price**: $60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:37">[00:17:37]</a>
*   **Overview**: One of the best technology companies over the last 30 years, with its shares multiplying by over 100 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:39">[00:17:39]</a>. Oracle provides important business management software globally, ensuring predictable income, high-profit margins, and a high return on equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
*   **Crisis Performance**: Demonstrated excellent performance during economic crises, including 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. Oracle is among American companies with the highest levels of liquidity on their balance sheets, alongside Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: A mature company with future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Its earnings per share could rise to almost $5 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>. Valuing it at its historical average of around 20 times earnings would yield a target price of $100 per share, offering interesting potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Like Cisco Systems, it is predictable, highly liquid, and resistant to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

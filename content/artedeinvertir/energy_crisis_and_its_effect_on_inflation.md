The current financial landscape is marked by significant [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] and market volatility, with indices like the Nasdaq correcting by 18-10 percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. A key contributing factor to this situation is the escalating [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

## The Soaring Cost of Energy
Energy prices, including oil and gas, alongside many raw materials, have "skyrocketed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This surge has direct repercussions for [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Reasons for the Energy Price Surge
Several factors contribute to the escalating [[Energy crisis and geopolitical tensions | energy crisis]]:
*   **Geopolitical Issues:** China's decision to stop buying coal from Australia due to geopolitical problems has led to a drastic increase in coal prices, with prices rising from $50 to $260 in 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.
*   **Reduced Investment:** Investment in raw materials, including oil and gas exploration projects, has drastically dropped to less than half of previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. This is partly due to environmental, social, and governance (ESG) concerns, making it "not well seen to finance mining projects for oil, gas, iron ore and others" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Supply-Demand Imbalance:** While demand for raw materials has remained stable or increased (driven by growth in China and other emerging markets), supply has dropped significantly due to a lack of investment in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. New deposits take years to operate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>. Oil reserves are also running out, driving prices to historical highs of the last six or seven years, around $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

### Consequences of the Energy Crisis
*   **Gas Prices:** Gas prices in Europe have multiplied tenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. European gas inventories are at five-year lows in 2021, leading to a scramble for gas for winter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>.
*   **Electricity Limits:** China is implementing limits on electricity usage and stopping production in certain industrial areas due to extreme electricity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. Middle-class households in China are not receiving electricity even at high prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.
*   **Commodity Bull Market:** The current bullish cycle in commodities and energy-related companies is "one of the largest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. This could lead to a bull market in raw materials lasting three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.

## How Energy Prices Drive [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | Inflation]]
Energy is a significant component of [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]], alongside food and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   **Reduced Disposable Income:** When energy prices rise sharply, it acts "almost like a tax," reducing people's disposable income as they have to spend more on essentials like fuel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. This stagnation of disposable income for the middle class is reminiscent of the 1970s and 2006-2011 periods, both of which saw energy crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Corporate Profits:** Reduced disposable income leads to less spending on discretionary goods, which can impact corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. If corporate profits decline, the stock market will follow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Wages vs. Prices:** During [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]], wages tend to rise slower than the prices of goods and services, further eroding purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.
*   **Correlation:** European [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] has a "very high correlation" with the price of Brent oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:53">[00:32:53]</a>.

## Market Implications and Investment Strategy
The rising [[Importance of energy markets and inflation on global finance | inflation]] presents a complex market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.
*   **Impact on Debt and Interest Rates:** The global debt level has "skyrocketed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. If [[Impact of inflation and interest rates on the economy | inflation]] forces central banks to raise interest rates, it could cause short-term problems for indebted economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Central banks face a dilemma: control [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] without raising rates too much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.
*   **Valuations:** High valuations, especially in "growth stocks" (e.g., Nasdaq companies like MyPleton, Uber, Airbnb that don't have massive profits), are vulnerable to rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. In a low-interest-rate environment, the terminal value of businesses that generate profits far out in time is higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, if [[Inflation and its impact on markets | inflation]] appears and interest rates rise, valuations are compressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Sector Performance under [[Inflation and its impact on markets | Inflation]]:**
    *   **Sectors likely to perform well:** Energy, real estate investment trusts (REITs) due to property value appreciation and fixed-rate debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>, stable consumer companies (e.g., toothpaste, razor blades) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>, precious metals and mining (though probability isn't high, performance can be very good) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:40">[00:21:40]</a>, and financial companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:15]</a>.
    *   **Sectors likely to perform poorly:** Discretionary consumer companies and fixed-income assets (short or long-term debt, bonds, treasury bills) because their purchasing power diminishes with [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>.
*   **Gold's Correlation:** Gold's price is highly correlated with [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:40">[00:24:40]</a>.

### An Alternative View: Transitory [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | Inflation]]
While many predict sustained [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]], an alternative view suggests it might be more transitory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>.
*   **Used Car Prices:** A significant driver of recent [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] has been the price of used cars and new cars, caused by a shortage of semiconductor chips <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:28">[00:28:28]</a>. Chip production capacity was diverted to electronics during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>. As chip supply problems are resolved (estimated 6-12 months) and new car inventory returns, this could lead to deflationary scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>.
*   **Travel and Hospitality:** Increased demand for travel (flights, hotels) post-confinement has also driven up prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. This is seen as circumstantial and temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

### Investment Advice
*   **Focus on Valuations:** Regardless of the [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] outlook, focus on buying "good, cheap companies with good management and a competitive advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:56">[00:33:56]</a>. These companies tend to do well in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overreaction:** Don't constantly change investment styles based on short-term market news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:23">[00:35:23]</a>. When there is a lot of news about a topic, it often means it's already incorporated into prices, signaling a peak of general interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** Invest for the long term (minimum three to five years) and cultivate emotional control to avoid panicking during market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:59">[00:52:59]</a>. Volatility (e.g., 6-15% drops) is normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:53">[00:52:53]</a>.
*   **Examples of Resilient Companies:** Companies like Tourmaline Oil (energy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:33">[00:37:33]</a>, CareTrust REIT (healthcare real estate) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:38">[00:41:38]</a>, and Tyson Foods (consumer staples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:11">[00:46:11]</a> are cited as examples that could benefit or remain resilient in the current environment. These are often well-managed, have low debt, and offer attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:18">[00:42:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:02">[00:47:02]</a>.

> [!INFO] Investor Mindset
> Successful investing requires applying common sense and isolating oneself from volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:18">[01:04:18]</a>. Good companies will prosper in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Observing consumer behavior (people still going out, traveling, buying goods) suggests that the overall economy might not be changing as drastically as short-term market fluctuations imply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:11">[01:46:11]</a>.

Understanding and evaluating business models, along with determining a company's intrinsic value, are fundamental aspects of successful investing. These concepts allow investors to make informed decisions and navigate the complexities of the stock market.

## The Michael Burry Approach

Renowned investor Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 subprime mortgage crisis, began his career as a Value Investor, focusing on finding undervalued small-cap companies with potential for good investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. His approach emphasizes understanding the specific reasons behind investment decisions made by both famous and lesser-known investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Burry's early writings in forums and blogs provided clues about his techniques for finding and [[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | valuing stocks]] and managing portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. This information is considered valuable for learning how to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Understanding Business Models

At the core of [[Valuation of companies and investment strategies | investing]] is the ability to thoroughly study a business and identify what makes it "good" or "bad" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>. This involves understanding the sector in which it operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>.

### Key Characteristics of a Good Business Model

*   **Competitive Advantage**: Companies with unique products or services that practically no one else manufactures often have a significant [[identifying_good_businesses_and_competitive_advantages | competitive advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. For example, Lockheed Martin's F-22 Raptor gives military supremacy and is manufactured by only one company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:50">[00:46:50]</a>. This allows for favorable pricing and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:09">[00:47:09]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income**: Businesses with predictable income streams are often more stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:05">[00:35:05]</a>. The healthcare sector, for instance, is considered predictable because people continue paying for medical expenses and insurance, even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:27">[01:04:27]</a>.
*   **Non-Cyclical Nature**: Non-cyclical businesses are less affected by general economic conditions. While a company like McDonald's is influenced by consumer spending, a defense contractor like Lockheed Martin is primarily affected by government defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:07">[00:44:07]</a>.
*   **Resilience to Crises**: It's crucial to assess how a company has performed in different economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:03">[00:44:03]</a>. Good businesses demonstrate strong "resistance" during crises, meaning their profits do not drastically decline like those of highly cyclical industries such as steel or airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>.
*   **Network Effect**: Businesses that connect many clients with many suppliers, like brokers or distributors, can generate a "network effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:15">[01:21:15]</a>. As they grow, more suppliers and clients are attracted, creating a virtuous circle and a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:59">[01:21:59]</a>.
*   **Adaptation to Trends**: Companies leveraging trends like automation and cost reduction through outsourcing (e.g., engineering firms) can have strong value propositions and recurring income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:17">[01:46:17]</a>.

### Distinguishing Good from Bad Business Models

While industries like aviation are growing, they can be considered "bad industries" due to intense competition and a lack of [[identifying_good_businesses_and_competitive_advantages | competitive advantage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. In such sectors, companies may struggle with high fixed costs, debt, and significant profit losses during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>. This contrasts with businesses like Lockheed Martin, which manufacture essential, unique products that governments are unlikely to cut from their budgets, even during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:42">[00:48:42]</a>.

## Intrinsic Value Calculation

[[assessing_intrinsic_stock_value | Intrinsic value]] refers to the true value of a company, independent of its stock market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. The goal of [[Valuation of companies and investment strategies | value investing]] is to buy a business below its [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

### Key Metrics for Intrinsic Value

*   **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Represents the portion of a company's profit allocated to each outstanding share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flow Per Share (FCFPS)**: Measures the cash a company generates after accounting for cash outflows to support its operations and maintain its capital assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.
*   **Net Equity**: The total assets of a company minus its total liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:03">[00:40:03]</a>.

The evolution of these metrics in the future is critical, as a business's value increases if its earnings per share, free cash flow per share, and net equity grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>.

### Valuation Methods

There are several methods for [[Valuation metrics and considerations for stock investments | valuing a business]]:

1.  **Historical Range Valuation**: This involves looking at a company's past valuation multiples (e.g., Price-to-Earnings (P/E), EV/EBITDA) to determine a reasonable current range <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.
2.  **Valuation by Comparables**: This method compares a company's valuation to similar companies in the same sector, adjusting for differences in growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:16]</a>. However, this can be problematic if the entire sector is undervalued or overvalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:31">[00:57:31]</a>.
3.  **Absolute Valuation (Discounted Cash Flow)**: This more complex method estimates the present value of a company's future cash flows. It involves projecting future earnings and then applying a multiplier that makes sense relative to the average market valuation and the company's quality, debt, and cyclicality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:56">[00:57:56]</a>.

It's important to remember that [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] is an opinion and subjective; it's not a definitive target price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:24">[01:22:24]</a>.

### Impact of Share Buybacks and Dividends

Companies can return capital to investors through various means, including dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:17">[01:13:17]</a>. Share buybacks can significantly increase earnings per share, as fewer shares are outstanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:55">[01:11:55]</a>. This can have a multiplier effect on profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:28">[01:12:28]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Decision Making

A deep understanding of business models and intrinsic value enables investors to act decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:15">[02:15:15]</a>.
It's crucial to:
*   **Understand Your Investments**: Know precisely where and why you have invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>. Do not invest based on short-term market movements, news, or analyst recommendations without your own independent study <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on the Long Term**: While the stock market can be volatile in the short term, focusing on a company's long-term profit generation and fundamental performance is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:41">[01:48:41]</a>.
*   **Embrace Volatility**: Market volatility often creates opportunities, as fear can lead people to sell good businesses at undervalue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:28">[01:35:28]</a>.
*   **Evaluate Problems**: When a quality company faces a specific problem, investors should analyze whether it is a temporary or permanent issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:42">[01:40:42]</a>. For instance, the Equifax data leak was a temporary problem that the company overcame, leading to significant stock recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:04">[01:41:04]</a>.
*   **Learn from History**: While history doesn't repeat itself exactly, studying past economic environments and how companies behaved can provide valuable insights into future scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:03">[01:44:03]</a>. Human behavior in the market tends to be consistent, driven by greed and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:09">[00:53:09]</a>.

Ultimately, generating real wealth in the stock market requires more than just luck; it demands continuous learning, a deep understanding of business models, and the ability to estimate a company's [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:19">[01:08:19]</a>.

The United States faces a [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | debt ceiling]] crisis that poses a [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risk]] to the American economy and global financial stability. This situation is expected to affect everyone, regardless of whether they invest in the [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Warnings from Janet Yellen
Janet Yellen, the current Director of the American Treasury and former Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, has issued stark warnings about the potential consequences of failing to address the debt ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.
She oversees an entity that manages over four trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

> [!warning] Potential Collapse
> Yellen has stated that an [[economic_and_debt_crisis_warning | economic disaster]] could be approaching, potentially leading to the [[potential_collapse_of_the_us_financial_system | total collapse of the financial system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. She warned that if a solution is not found in the coming weeks, it would cause irreversible damage to the American economy and to [[impact_on_global_financial_markets | global stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. This collapse would have terrible consequences for both [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stocks]] and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Yellen described putting an arbitrary debt ceiling and creating periodic or manufactured crises that risk financial and economic stability as "tremendously irresponsible," especially while recovering from a deep crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## The Debt Ceiling Problem
The United States, like most countries, consistently spends more money than it earns, resulting in a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. To finance this spending, new debt is issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Years ago, a limit was established on how much the U.S. could go into debt, and that limit is currently being approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>.

### Extraordinary Measures
Janet Yellen has already begun taking desperate measures to manage this problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:00">[01:51:00]</a>. Since the U.S. is at its debt limit, the Treasury has had to significantly cut investments in pension and health plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. Additionally, investments made by the government for employee retirement plans have been suspended, only to resume once the problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. These spending cuts amount to more than 200 billion U.S. dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>.

Yellen has communicated to Congress that these extraordinary measures are likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>.

## Market Reactions and Consequences of Default
Financial markets are already pricing in a potential U.S. bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. The price of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), which are insurance policies against government debt default, has multiplied by more than nine times for American government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. This indicates an enormous risk of the U.S. defaulting on its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### Impact on Global Financial System
A U.S. debt default would lead to total chaos and a financial collapse, especially since the entire global financial system is connected to American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:00">[04:17:00]</a>. U.S. debt bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally, currently standing at 30 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00">[04:25:00]</a>. As investor Ray Dalio explains, one country's debt is another's asset, with millions of entities and individuals worldwide holding these treasury bills and bonds, historically considered the safest investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:38:00">[04:38:00]</a>.

A collapse of this asset class would create a chain effect, impacting banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans that have invested heavily in U.S. debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>. This situation would be similar to the 2008 Lehman Brothers collapse, but multiplied by 30 times due to the significantly higher total U.S. debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

### White House Projections
A White House report quantifies the potential effects of a debt default:
*   Over 2 million jobs lost <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.
*   An additional cost of over 750 billion dollars annually in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>.
*   The dollar and the [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stock market]] would collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>.
*   [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | Stock market]] drops could reach up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

## Proposed Solutions
The most viable solution would be an agreement between Republicans and Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. However, desperate solutions are being considered.

### The Trillion-Dollar Coin
One "comical" and highly risky proposed solution is minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:00">[06:56:00]</a>. The U.S. Treasury might mint several of these coins to temporarily solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:00">[07:07:00]</a>. This is possible due to a legal loophole in American law, which allows the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins, unlike the Federal Reserve's ability to print digital money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. These coins, with a nominal value larger than the GDP of countries like Spain, Mexico, or Switzerland, would be deposited with the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to pay its expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

While this could work in the short term, it would not send a message of stability to financial markets, and the value of the dollar, bonds, and [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stocks]] would likely continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Historical Precedent
The debt limit scenario was also reached in 2011 and 2013. Even with temporary solutions, markets experienced high volatility in the following weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:34:00">[11:34:00]</a>.

## Protecting Investments
Investors are seeking ways to [[preparing_for_market_crises | protect their savings and their investments]] against this [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>.

*   **Gold:** The price of gold would likely rise sharply as a safe haven, as its value is measured against the U.S. dollar, and a dollar collapse would reflect in a higher gold price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. Gold-related stocks, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Betting Against the Market:** Many investors are betting against U.S. government debt and the [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:00">[09:33:00]</a>.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** Large investors, like Ray Dalio, with access to sophisticated products, could buy CDS to protect against default risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:53:00">[09:53:00]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs:** There are Inverse ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that go up in value when the market goes down, typically by investing in derivatives that bet against the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>. An example is the ProShares Short S&P 500 (ticker: "pr√≥cers short sp500" mentioned in the transcript), which trades around $15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>. However, these instruments have historically performed poorly in the long term, as the [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market]] tends to revalue over time; they are typically used tactically for short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

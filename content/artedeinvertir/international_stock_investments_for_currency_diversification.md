The world's most important currency, the dollar, is predicted to decline, a process that will be accelerated by recent decisions from central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This potential devaluation affects global economies and stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, making it crucial for investors to protect their capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. This article explores [[investment_strategies_to_hedge_against_dollar_devaluation | investment strategies to hedge against dollar devaluation]], with a particular focus on [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market investments]] outside the US, as a means of [[importance_of_diversification_in_stock_investments | currency diversification]].

## The Dollar's Vulnerability and Global Impact

The dollar currently serves as the global foreign exchange reserve, meaning its fluctuations impact other currencies and economies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. It would be "naive to think" that those without dollars will not be affected by its devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Data from the International Monetary Fund shows that 62% of the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars, and factoring in dollarized economies, this could be over 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

A "chilling fact" is that in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created, a significant figure for a currency with 200 years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. Since the crisis began, the dollar has devalued more than 10% against the euro in just nine months, despite Europe also creating new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Most major currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Prior to the 1970s, every new dollar created had to be backed by gold, which controlled inflation and aggressive currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. However, this changed in the early 1970s with the Bretton Woods agreement, giving the Federal Reserve the ability to print unlimited dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

While this tool was used cautiously in the past, 2020 saw the amount of new dollars in circulation get "out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The Federal Reserve, under Jerome Powell, has even stated comfort with a higher level of inflation, implying further devaluation of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Historically, such "monetary experiments" have led to disastrous consequences, from the Roman Empire to recent cases like Venezuela and Zimbabwe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

Even if you don't live in the US or hold dollars, this economic phenomenon will affect you, as other central banks are replicating US monetary policies, increasing the supply of euros, yen, and pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. Consequently, money held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to inflation, and fixed income or bonds are also negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

## Expert Strategies for Protection

Prominent investors have warned about this potential problem and adjusted their [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | investment strategies]]:

*   **Ray Dalio**: Considered the "Steve Jobs of financial markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, Dalio manages Bridgewater Associates, the largest investment fund in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. He has warned that the dollar could decrease in value and cease to be the world's foreign currency reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. Dalio is investing in gold, inflation-protected bonds, and stocks outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.
*   **Stanley Druckenmiller**: With average annual returns of over 30% for 30 years and no losses in any year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, Druckenmiller is "aggressively selling dollars" due to a high conviction that its value will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. He foresees inflation increasing over the next 5-6 years and is investing in gold and buying mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

## Strategies for Currency Diversification

Beyond directly selling dollars on the forex market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, or investing in gold via ETFs (e.g., iShares Physical Gold ETF, GLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, or inflation-protected bonds (TIPS ETFs like iShares TIPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, a key strategy for protecting capital is to invest in international stocks.

### Investing in Stocks Outside the US

This approach is crucial because investing in dollar-denominated stocks means any gains could be negated by currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Ray Dalio himself has invested $200 million in an ETF for emerging markets (EM) that invests in stocks of countries less indebted and less likely to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This ETF, listed under the ticker EEM, has performed well in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Investing in Large US Exporting Companies

A highly lucrative way to protect against currency devaluation is to invest in large US exporting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. These companies sell products abroad, receiving more valuable foreign currency, while their costs remain dollar-denominated. This increases their income and earnings per share during devaluation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

*   **Historical Examples:**
    *   **Rolls Royce (UK)**: After Brexit caused the pound to plummet over 10% in 2016, Rolls Royce, a UK company manufacturing products there but exporting globally, appreciated more than 30% in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
    *   **GlaxoSmithKline (UK)**: This pharmaceutical company also saw its stock rise more than 20% immediately after the pound's devaluation post-Brexit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

You can identify companies with significant export sales by checking their annual reports for sales breakdown by region or by using websites like MarketScreener.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

#### Investment Opportunities: Large US Exporting Companies

Here are two examples of large US exporting companies that could benefit:

1.  **ExxonMobil (XOM)**:
    *   The largest oil company in the world, listed under the ticker XOM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   It meets two conditions for protection against currency devaluation: it produces raw materials (oil), and the company exports over half its products outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. MarketScreener.com shows only 35% of its production is sold in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   Currently trading around $38 per share, down from almost $80, as oil prices are below average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: When oil returns to its historical average ($50-$65), Exxon can earn about $4 per share and pay a $3 dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>. Historically, Exxon traded at 15 times earnings. A target value of $60 per share (4 * 15) is expected in 2-3 years, plus over $6 in dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Historically, it yielded 4%, implying a target value of $75 (3 * 25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

2.  **Pfizer (PFE)**:
    *   A leading biotechnology company, listed under the ticker PFE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>.
    *   Warren Buffett recently invested over $135 million in its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
    *   More than 50% of its sales are outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>.
    *   It is a good business with high ROIs (consistently above 20%) and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Pfizer expects to earn around $3 in earnings per share this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. The biotechnology sector historically trades at 18 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>. This suggests a target value of $54 per share (3 * 18) for next year, compared to its current price of $38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. It also offers growth and an interesting dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

Other large US exporting companies that can do well in any economic environment and trade at a reasonable valuation include Apple, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.

By diversifying investments into international stocks and large exporting companies, investors can potentially protect themselves from currency devaluation and benefit from global economic shifts.

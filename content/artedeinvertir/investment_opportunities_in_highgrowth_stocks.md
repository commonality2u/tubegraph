The year 2020 saw exceptional performance from many high-growth stocks, even as the global crisis worsened and market uncertainty rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. While many investors are concerned about a potential new crisis in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, specific high-growth companies continued to thrive. This article explores the characteristics of these stocks, the market's current euphoric state, and methods for valuing such companies.

## Market Context and Investor Warnings

The emergence of new, faster-spreading variants of the current global problem has caused panic among investors, leading to flight cancellations, border closures, and new containment measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This uncertainty is generally not favorable for the economy or the [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Adding to concerns, new U.S. economic stimulus measures were lower than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

Notable investors have voiced caution:
*   **Warren Buffett** urged the U.S. government to increase stimulus measures to prevent economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, stating that Congress needs to act now to provide a "new injection of money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.
*   **Stanley Druckenmiller**, known for his excellent [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investment]] track record, expressed concern about "absolute euphoria" in the markets, predicting "very very complicated" years ahead for the next 3 to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He notes that bull markets often end when euphoria is prevalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>.
*   **Joel Greenblatt**, who has generated over 30% annual returns for decades, warned of significant market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. He highlighted a striking fact: buying every company that lost money in 2019 but had a market capitalization over a billion dollars in 2020 would have yielded an impressive 65% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This suggests that basic [[value_and_growth_stocks_analysis | investment]] principles requiring companies to produce profits are being forgotten in times of euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

One major sign of current market euphoria is that the traded volume of options, a leveraged [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investment]] instrument, has surpassed the traded volume of shares for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Options, while amplifying gains in a rising market, can lead to significant losses, even total value loss, when the market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>.

## Valuing High-Growth Companies with Losses

Not all companies with business losses are bad [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market investments]]; some, like Amazon or Netflix, generated losses for years before becoming highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

A three-step method can be applied to value high-growth companies that are currently operating at a loss but are expected to grow significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>:

1.  **Estimate Future Sales:** Project sales for 3 to 5 years, assuming a conservative growth rate lower than the current rate, as growth tends to slow as companies gain scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
2.  **Estimate Future Profit Margins:** Determine potential profit margins once the company reaches maturity. This can be done by looking at mature companies in the same sector (e.g., Toyota/Volkswagen for auto, Microsoft/Google for tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier:** Apply a valuation multiple to the estimated future earnings per share. This multiplier varies by industry; for example, 30-40 times for high-growth tech, but 15-20 times for more cyclical industries like automotive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Examples of High-Growth Stocks

### Nio (NIV)

Nio, often called the "Chinese version of Tesla," has seen its stock multiply by over 12 times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It has experienced losses but exceptional stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

Applying the valuation method:
*   **Future Sales:** Estimated at $47 billion in the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins:** Using the auto sector average (e.g., Volkswagen, Toyota) of around 6% net profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>, Nio could achieve $3 million in net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>, translating to about $2 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
*   **Profit Multiplier:** For the automotive sector, 10-20 times profits could be applied, resulting in an intrinsic valuation of around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

This suggests Nio (trading at $48 per share at the time of the recording) is trading above its fair value based on this analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, strong conviction in higher future sales could justify a valuation up to $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA)

Tesla is a highly popular [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock]] that multiplied its value by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. It began generating profits in 2020 after losses in 2019, and its inclusion in the S&P 500 index propelled its shares to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

Not all investors are bullish. Michael Burry, famously depicted in 'The Big Short,' has opened a bearish position against Tesla due to its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. He notes Tesla's market capitalization of over $600 billion surpasses that of all other [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | traditional automobile]] manufacturers combined, despite Tesla generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Metrics comparing market value per vehicle produced show electric vehicle companies are valued drastically higher than traditional ones (e.g., Tesla over $1 million per vehicle vs. Volkswagen $10,000) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

Despite low current profits, Tesla has the capacity for drastic future profit increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>, requiring detailed study from investors.

### Palantir Technologies (PLTR)

Palantir, a high-growth technology company specializing in analyzing large amounts of data to anticipate threats, has more than tripled on the [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] since its listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>. It is currently in a phase of producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>.

Applying the valuation method:
*   **Future Sales:** Expected to reach around $1.4 billion in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>, growing at a conservative 40% annually to $7.5 billion in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins:** Based on mature technology companies like Microsoft, Oracle, or Google, which generate 20-25% profits on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>, Palantir could achieve $1.8 billion in potential profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>, or $1 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   **Profit Multiplier:** For the [[stock_opportunities_in_healthcare_and_technology_sectors | technology sector]], a multiplier of 30 times earnings is applied, leading to a fair value of around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

This valuation suggests the current stock price incorporates a significant portion of future benefit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. A firm conviction in higher growth over the next 10-15 years could lead to a higher intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Alibaba (BABA)

Alibaba is an interesting case due to recent events, specifically a Chinese government investigation into alleged monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Some speculate this is a message to founder Jack Ma for his criticism of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:55">[00:16:55]</a>.

Financially, Alibaba's current valuation is attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings, with its intrinsic value potentially double the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. However, in jurisdictions with fewer investor rights, political factors can significantly impact [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The key is to monitor the evolving situation and the company's cooperation with government guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Protecting Investments from New Risks

In volatile market conditions, it's important to [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | invest]] with common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Maintain Liquidity:** Hold 10-30% liquidity in a portfolio, as the market statistically corrects by at least 10% every year, creating new [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>.
*   **Conviction-Based Investing:** Only [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | invest]] in companies where an in-depth analysis has been conducted, and there is strong conviction that it is a good [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>. Even in euphoric or expensive markets, good [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | opportunities]] can be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Follow Major Investors:** Observe how major investors like Stanley Druckenmiller and Michael Burry are positioning their portfolios. Druckenmiller's main holdings include high-growth, high-profit companies like Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Michael Burry's focus includes Google, Pfizer, and a pharmaceutical company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.

The United States dollar, considered the most important currency globally, is experiencing a decline accelerated by recent decisions made by [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | central banks]] and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Prominent investors like Ray Dalio, who manages the world's largest investment fund, have publicly stated that the dollar will lose value and are actively selling the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. The fate of the dollar significantly impacts economies and stock markets worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Dollar as a Global Reserve Currency

Currently, the dollar serves as the global foreign exchange reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This status means that fluctuations in the dollar's value directly affect other currencies and economies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. Approximately 62% of the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars, according to data from the International Monetary Fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. When considering dollarized economies, the real percentage could be even higher, potentially exceeding 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.

A stark example of recent devaluation is that in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Since the onset of the crisis, the dollar has devalued more than 10% against the Euro in just nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## The Shift to Fiat Currency and Money Printing

Most of the world's major currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Prior to the 1970s, each new dollar created had to be backed by a certain amount of gold deposited in the corresponding [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | central bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This mechanism helped control [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | inflation]] and aggressive currency devaluation because gold cannot be created out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

The situation changed in the early 1970s with the Bretton Woods Agreement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Since then, the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Federal Reserve]] gained the ability to print as many dollars as it desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. This powerful tool had been used cautiously in previous years, as money's value is determined by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. A drastic increase in the supply of new dollars in circulation typically leads to a fall in the currency's value, increased [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | inflation]], and potential economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

## Recent Actions by the Federal Reserve

In 2020, the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Federal Reserve]] significantly escalated its money printing, as evidenced by the M2 money supply data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. While money printing occurred at a normal rate of economic growth prior to 2020, the amount of new dollars in circulation has gotten out of control since the crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>.

Furthermore, the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Federal Reserve]], under President Jerome Powell, unexpectedly declared comfort with a higher level of [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | inflation]] in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. This policy shift implies an increased money supply and further devaluation of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>. Stanley Druckenmiller, a legendary investor, described the current union of the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Federal Reserve]] and the Treasury as an unprecedented precedent since the Fed's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. He anticipates [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | inflation]] increasing over the next 5 or 6 years due to this devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Currency Devaluation

Historically, such "monetary experiments" have often led to negative outcomes:
*   **Roman Empire:** Its currency aggressively devalued, contributing to its fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.
*   **Germany (early 20th century):** Attempted to repay old debts by printing money, leading to bankruptcy and hyperinflation where money was used as toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **Venezuela:** Recent cases with disastrous economic consequences, where money is used for souvenirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.
*   **Zimbabwe:** An extreme case where a 100 trillion dollar banknote was issued, and money was transported in wheelbarrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Global Replication of Devaluation Policies

Even for those outside the U.S. or not holding dollars, this economic phenomenon will have an effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. [[role_of_central_banks_and_government_policies_in_inflation | Central banks]] and governments in other countries are replicating the actions of the U.S., leading to a significant increase in the amount of new money (euros, yen, pounds) being printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Consequences for Investments

This widespread printing of money implies that savings held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Similarly, investments in fixed income or bonds are also significantly affected by rising [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | inflation]] or currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

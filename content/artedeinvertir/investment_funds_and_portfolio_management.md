## Warren Buffett's Recent Activities and Market Outlook
Warren Buffett's portfolio and balance sheet have recently been published, showing an unprecedented accumulation of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This could be interpreted as a message from Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. Historically, when Buffett has accumulated liquidity, it has often preceded market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He advises investors to observe his actions rather than just his words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:37">[00:00:37]</a>. Currently, he is selling shares, accumulating liquidity, and has only been buying Berkshire Hathaway shares en masse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

As of September, Berkshire Hathaway's liquidity levels are around $150-160 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. It is currently the publicly traded company with the most liquidity, even more than Apple, Google, or Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

Historically, Berkshire Hathaway's liquidity levels have correlated with market sentiment:
*   In 1998-1999, as the stock market became expensive (dot-com bubble), Buffett's liquidity shot up from nearly zero to $20 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.
*   After the dot-com bubble burst, liquidity levels decreased as Buffett started buying undervalued shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   From 2007 to 2008, liquidity levels increased drastically, preparing for the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.
*   In 2009-2010, after the correction, liquidity levels were reduced as he put that capital to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>.
*   Currently, liquidity levels are at historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

Buffett has also warned that the current pandemic and its ramifications might not be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, stating that society has struggled to prepare for difficult but possible events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Market Euphoria and Expert Warnings
A Bank of America study indicates that market growth expectations for the S&P 500 are close to 20%, significantly higher than the 15% seen during the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. Peaks of euphoria and very high expectations have often coincided with stock market problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. Safer investment moments typically occur during periods of high negativity, like March last year or 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.

Other notable investors, such as Stanley Druckenmiller, have also issued warnings. Druckenmiller believes there is a bubble not only in the bond market but "everywhere" – including cryptocurrencies, stocks (especially large ones), art, and wine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. This situation is compared to the dot-com bubble, where people discounted 20 years of internet growth into a short period, leading to parabolic rises and subsequent large drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. The market tends to discount future events very far out in a short period, creating parabolic rises that attract many new, inexperienced investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Favorite Stock and New Investments
Buffett's favorite stock this year appears to be Berkshire Hathaway itself, with buybacks totaling $13 billion in the first six months of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:41">[00:27:41]</a>. Historically, share buybacks by Berkshire Hathaway have preceded positive stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>. Buffett considers shares cheap when they trade below 1.6 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. The book value per share is estimated to reach $230 next year and is growing at about 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:26">[00:29:26]</a>. Based on Buffett's own valuation ratio, the intrinsic value could be $360 currently, and $480 in three to four years if book value continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:15">[00:31:15]</a>.

Beyond Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett has mostly reduced or sold shares in other holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:59">[00:31:59]</a>, with minor additions to Chevron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:08">[00:32:08]</a>. He has added new positions in:
*   **Royalty Pharma:** This company buys rights to pharmaceutical drugs, receiving a percentage of sales (royalties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:33">[00:32:33]</a>. It's a business model that generates significant free cash flow and benefits from inflation, as investments are made with "old dollars" and revenues can rise with prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:39">[00:34:39]</a>. The main risk lies in patent expiration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:48">[00:34:48]</a>.
*   **Floor & Decor:** A manufacturer and distributor of various types of flooring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:03">[00:37:03]</a>. Its strategy involves opening new stores and using online tools and design advisors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:31">[00:37:31]</a>. The company has multiplied its sales by 10 and profits by 20 since 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>. The business is less cyclical than it seems, as a large part of sales come from renovations rather than just new constructions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and [[portfolio_management_and_investment_education | Investment Education]]
[[Investment strategies and philosophies | Warren Buffett's investment philosophy]] emphasizes three basic premises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>:
1.  **Quality Stocks:** Investing in good businesses with high confidence in continued earnings growth over 5, 10, or 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.
2.  **Sensible Valuation:** Buying assets at a reasonable price, not overpaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
3.  **Long-Term Vision:** Holding investments for extended periods, especially during market downturns, to benefit from subsequent rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:16">[00:19:16]</a>.

Drops in the S&P 500 of more than 10% have historically been followed by significant positive returns over the next five years, with the exception of 1998 due to the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>.

### The Importance of Training
Investing in the stock market requires a minimum level of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. Many financial problems stem from people's ignorance and lack of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:15">[00:20:15]</a>. It is crucial to understand how financial markets work and be willing to assume volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:46">[00:20:46]</a>.

Warren Buffett, for example, focuses on estimating a company's long-term earnings and applying a valuation multiple based on historical averages, rather than using discounted cash flow models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:42">[00:42:42]</a>.

## True Value Funds: An [[Investment strategy and asset allocation | Investment Strategy]]
True Value, an asset management company, offers several investment funds based on a long-term, value-oriented philosophy:
*   **True Value (original fund):** Aims to balance risk-reward and serves as a feeder for the best ideas from other funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.
*   **True Value Small Caps:** Focuses on small-cap companies, which can be more volatile but offer higher potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:21">[01:13:21]</a>. This fund is currently closed to new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:03">[01:21:03]</a>.
*   **True Value Compounders (new fund):** Launched in collaboration with Renta4, this fund focuses on "compounder" companies – those that consistently increase their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:22">[01:05:22]</a>.

### Core Principles of True Value Funds:
*   **Long-Term Horizon:** Recommended investment period of seven years, acknowledging potential volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:43">[01:02:43]</a>.
*   **Global Reach (OECD focus):** Invests in companies from developed countries like Europe, UK, Nordic countries, Canada, and the US, prioritizing stable economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:37]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Securities:** Focus on non-cyclical businesses that are highly resistant to economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>.
*   **Low Debt:** Companies with low leverage to strengthen future business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:50">[01:05:50]</a>.
*   **Aligned Management:** Prioritizes companies where management's interests are aligned with shareholders, often through stock options or significant personal investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:56">[01:05:56]</a>.

The strategy focuses on forecasting the company's future earnings power rather than being overly demanding on the entry valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:42">[01:34:42]</a>. This differs from traditional "value" investing that seeks very cheap, low-quality cyclical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.

### Fund Performance and Transparency
True Value and True Value Small Caps have demonstrated strong historical returns, with True Value having an accumulated return of over 160% and True Value Small Caps over 130% since inception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. However, past profitability does not guarantee future profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:08">[01:07:08]</a>. The fund managers are also the largest investors in their own funds, aligning their interests with other participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:37">[01:07:37]</a>.

### New Fund: True Value Compounders
This new fund aims for a double-digit annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:39">[01:37:39]</a>. It will have little overlap with existing True Value funds, focusing on distinct companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. It seeks an average valuation of 15 times adjusted earnings, with expected annual growth of 15-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:06">[01:31:06]</a>.

**Examples of companies that fit the "Compounder" profile (expected in the fund):**
*   A VMS software company with a strong crisis-resistant model, growing at 40% annually and expecting 150% growth in three years. Its CEO has opted for stock options over a high salary, aligning interests <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.
*   A US consumer sector company that doubled sales and profits in three years, also with aligned management and expecting to double sales and profits again in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:15">[01:33:15]</a>.
*   A recurrent business services company that has not suffered during crises and doubled sales and profits in three years, with management interests aligned and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:24">[01:35:24]</a>.
*   An IT cloud services company that can grow organically and through acquisitions, with aligned interests, low debt, and a valuation that doesn't discount future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

**Fees and Structure of True Value Compounders:**
*   Fixed commission: 1.20% (Founder Class at 0.95% for the first $10 million) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>.
*   Success commission: Based on results with a high watermark <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>.
*   Reimbursement commission: 3% if redeemed before three years, favoring long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:55">[01:13:55]</a>.
*   Depository commission: 0.1% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:57">[01:12:57]</a>.

*   **Navaroo:** A top historical holding in True Value, multiplying its investment multiple times, expected to continue growing at 15-20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:18">[00:58:18]</a>.
*   **Walt Disney:** Profits are recovering, but the stock is already listed at a demanding valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:01">[00:46:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
The current market is characterized by high expectations and potential bubbles, as noted by leading investors like Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>. In this environment, a disciplined [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment strategy]] focused on high-quality, non-cyclical businesses with sensible valuations, low debt, and aligned management is crucial for [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | managing an investment portfolio]] and generating long-term wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:20">[01:05:20]</a>. Financial education is key to navigating market volatility and making informed decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:06">[00:20:06]</a>. The True Value funds aim to apply these principles, seeking companies that compound intrinsic value over time, providing a clear and transparent [[portfolio_management_and_investment_education | portfolio management and investment education]] approach.

The insurance sector has been profoundly significant for [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_and_insights | Warren Buffett]] throughout his investing career, contributing a substantial portion of his wealth and Berkshire Hathaway's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. He has invested an impressive sum of 7 billion dollars in a new stock within this sector, even requesting the SEC to keep the purchases secret until legally required to disclose them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This sector has historically yielded very good results for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>.

## The "Float": A Key Advantage
The cornerstone of [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett's investment strategies]] in insurance is the concept of "float" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. Float is defined as money that insurance companies hold but does not belong to them, which they can invest for their benefit before paying out claims or compensations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>. When a policyholder pays an annual premium (e.g., $1,000 for car or home insurance), the insurer has a period of 1 to 3 years, on average, to invest that money before potential compensation payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

### How it Works
*   **Legal Investment:** The law permits insurers to invest this float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:00">[04:51:00]</a>. Unlike banks, which must pay interest to depositors for money they invest, insurers make money from selling the insurance policies themselves and then get to invest the advanced premiums without paying interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy:** Regulators typically mandate that most of the float be invested in low-risk assets like treasury bills, fixed income, and short-term bonds, with only a small portion (10-15%) potentially in the stock market or real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.
*   **Buffett's Innovation:** [[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Warren Buffett]] realized that if he invested in insurance companies with longer compensation periods (e.g., 3-4 years instead of 1), he could enjoy more time to balance market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:05:00">[06:05:00]</a>. His key insight was to invest a larger portion of this float in stocks than traditional insurance companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>. This strategic use of float, combined with his exceptional ability to invest it, accounts for at least 40-50% of Berkshire Hathaway's historical performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>.
*   **Scale of Float:** As of March 2024, Berkshire Hathaway held a float of 168 billion dollars from its insurance businesses, which translates into more than 20 billion dollars in pre-tax profits annually, even with a conservative 5-7% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>. This float has consistently grown over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

## Historical Successes in the Insurance Sector
The insurance sector has been the most profitable for [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] throughout his history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway's results since 1988 show that a dollar invested in the company multiplied by over 100 times, compared to a 20-fold increase for a dollar invested in the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>.

One of the most successful investments in this sector has been GEICO, a low-cost auto insurance company, whose income skyrocketed to almost 20 billion dollars, contributing significantly to [[Warren Buffetts market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett's]] fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. The insurance segment constitutes a large part of Berkshire Hathaway's holding company, primarily through private companies acquired over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is considered the largest insurance company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>.

## Recent Investment: Chubb (CB)
[[Warren Buffetts recent stock acquisitions | Warren Buffett]] has aggressively invested nearly 7 billion dollars in Chubb (ticker: CB), a publicly listed property insurance company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>. This is notable as most of his insurance holdings are private, making Chubb one of his first or latest publicly listed insurance sector purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

*   **Investment Timing:** He bought Chubb stock when it was at an all-time high, demonstrating that [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | investing in the stock market]] doesn't always require waiting for prices to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>. He started buying when the valuation floor was 10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Chubb is valued at a much lower valuation (12 times earnings) than the market average (S&P 500 at 20 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:00">[03:41:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Chubb has a strong competitive advantage due to "Big Data," enabling precise risk assessment and profitable pricing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>. Its combined ratio, which measures underwriting profitability (100 - combined ratio = profit margin), is consistently better than rivals, indicating greater discipline and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>.
*   **Float Management:** Chubb prudently manages its float, with 84% invested in debt with a maximum duration of 5 years, reducing sensitivity to interest rate changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Speculation:** Some speculate that [[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] might eventually seek to acquire Chubb entirely to gain control over its 120 billion dollars in float and potentially generate even higher returns than Chubb currently achieves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. Chubb's float represents two to three full years of insurance sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>, partly because it offers multi-year insurance policies, providing more valuable float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Why the Insurance Sector is Profitable
Insurance is a predictable and non-cyclical business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>. The business model combines two key results:
1.  **Investment Result:** Profits generated from investing the float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>.
2.  **Technical Result (Combined Ratio):** Profit from the sale of insurance policies themselves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>. A combined ratio below 100% indicates an underwriting profit (e.g., 93% means 7% profit margin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. Some companies even operate at an underwriting loss (e.g., State Farm at 107% combined ratio) because the profitability from investing the float is so substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>.

Higher interest rates generally benefit insurance companies by increasing the returns they can earn on their float <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:00">[04:58:00]</a>. This is evident in the increased profitability of companies like Chubb since interest rates rose in 2022-2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:00">[05:12:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

## Market Outlook for Insurance
Despite its profitability and historical importance, the insurance sector is currently one of the cheapest in the S&P 500 and in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. The sector ETF (KIE) shows decent estimated earnings growth of 18% for the next 3-5 years and trades at only 12 times earnings, or even 11 times for the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This compares to the S&P 500 average of 20 times earnings and big tech companies at nearly 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. This undervaluation presents attractive opportunities, as noted by [[warren_buffetts_market_insights_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]] and other investors like Bill Ackman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>.

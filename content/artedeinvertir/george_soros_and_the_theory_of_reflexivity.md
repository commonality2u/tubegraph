George Soros, a renowned investor, has generated a significant portion of his wealth through his distinctive approach, primarily rooted in the theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Since founding his fund in 1970, Soros has achieved spectacular results, including average annual returns of 25% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Notably, he has emerged strengthened from major market downturns, such as those in 1987, 1990, the dot-com bubble, 2008, and 2011, without suffering significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. Soros, like other great investors, stands out for his unconventional methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

## [[history_and_background_of_george_soros | Background of George Soros]]

Soros's unique perspective is deeply influenced by his past. He was a Hungarian refugee during World War II, escaping the Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. His middle-class parents managed to falsify papers, allowing him to travel to the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>. With some financial means, he gained access to the London Business School, a highly respected institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.

### Influence of Philosophy on Investment

Soros's true passion lies in philosophy rather than investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:08">[01:46:08]</a>. One of his mentors was Karl Popper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:50">[01:49:50]</a>. This philosophical grounding led him to merge philosophy with investment, which ultimately gave rise to the theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:19">[01:54:19]</a>.

After graduating from the London Business School, Soros faced significant challenges finding work due to a deeply racist and xenophobic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:22">[02:04:22]</a>. He took odd jobs, including selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:27">[02:18:27]</a>. He eventually met another Hungarian middle manager at a financial institution, which provided his entry into the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:26">[02:27:26]</a>.

Initially, Soros began as a value investor, focusing on cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>. Over time, his philosophy evolved to maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:31">[02:44:31]</a>. He gained a reputation by identifying undervalued German stocks in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly those with dual stock structures (common and preferred shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:39">[02:58:39]</a>. His successful reports to clients led to their support in founding his company with just $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:16">[03:31:16]</a>. This fund, later known as the Quantum Fund, grew organically, largely without external contributions after a certain point, reaching assets under management exceeding $30-40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:21">[03:43:21]</a>. This growth exemplifies the power of compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:07">[04:07:07]</a>.

## The Alchemy of Finance

Soros explains his theories in his book, "The Alchemy of Finance," originally published in 1988-1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:06">[04:27:06]</a>. This book is considered very complex, requiring a deep understanding of finance and investment experience to grasp its insights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:47">[04:48:47]</a>. Soros's investment style evolved from simply investing in stocks to speculating in currencies, indices, and raw materials like gold and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:04">[05:22:04]</a>. He typically operates in these four or five asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:24">[05:31:24]</a>.

## The Theory of Reflexivity

### Core Concepts

Soros posits that the financial system is a human construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:57">[05:53:57]</a>. He argues that financial crises cannot be predicted with the reliability of, for example, weather patterns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:03">[06:00:03]</a>. If they could be predicted, they wouldn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:22">[06:20:22]</a>. While some investors, like Soros, can anticipate events at certain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:44">[06:27:44]</a>, he emphasizes the extreme complexity of guessing economic movements due to a multitude of unpredictable factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:40">[06:40:40]</a>.

Instead of predicting the economy, Soros focuses on anticipating the perception investors will have of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:30">[06:51:30]</a>. He views financial markets as a "common mentality" created by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:46">[07:02:46]</a>. This concept relates to quantum theory, where the observer influences the observed element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:48">[07:14:48]</a>. In financial markets, investors' collective vision about the market actively influences it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:14">[07:27:14]</a>. For example, if a participant has a vision that financial markets will fall and acts on it, that fall can materialize—a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:19">[07:54:19]</a>.

### Reflexivity in Market Cycles

Soros's theory of reflexivity seeks to identify "boom patterns" — large rises (bubbles) and large falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:02">[08:15:02]</a>. He contends that markets are inherently unstable and always biased, either upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:01">[08:25:01]</a>. This perspective dismisses the theory of efficient markets as "nonsense," because market participants act based on their emotions, feelings, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:24">[08:51:24]</a>.

The core of reflexivity involves the interplay between perception (red line) and asset prices/quotation (blue line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:07">[09:05:07]</a>. In a reflective process, perception can modify reality, which then reinforces the perception, creating a feedback loop.

**Phases of a Reflective Process (Boom/Bust Cycle):**
1.  **Initial Period (AB):** People begin to form a perception, for example, that an asset like housing is a good investment and will rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:37">[10:07:37]</a>. The market price (blue line) lags slightly but then tends to rise much faster than the underlying fundamentals suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:02">[10:54:02]</a>.
2.  **Test Period (BC):** In every bubble, there's a test period where prices stabilize or even fall slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:23">[11:07:23]</a>. If this fall isn't too abrupt and people gain confidence that it's a buying opportunity, the price can then experience another rally, often exceeding the initial peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a>. Soros argues that the market doesn't anticipate events; rather, market participants' actions produce changes in reality or perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:07">[11:48:07]</a>. This means a price increase can encourage new investments and share buybacks, which in turn stimulate the economy and drive prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:18:24">[17:18:24]</a>.
3.  **New Paradigm/Reversal (CD):** The bubble reaches a point where prices become completely disconnected from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:02">[13:28:02]</a>. Small changes or news events can then trigger enormous falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:07">[13:42:07]</a>. For instance, the dot-com bubble peaked around the time Bill Gates stated Microsoft shares were incredibly overvalued, leading to a significant drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:21">[13:54:21]</a>. This phase is irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:31">[14:22:31]</a>.
4.  **Dangerous Period (DE):** Even as market prices fall, fundamentals might still show inertia from previous capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:17">[14:30:17]</a>. This is a dangerous time, as "bargain hunters" focusing solely on past fundamentals might mistakenly buy, thinking a rebound will occur, similar to the test period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:28">[14:44:28]</a>. The reflective period ends, and the fall continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:01">[15:06:01]</a>.

### Examples of Reflexivity

#### The 2008 Financial Crisis

The 2008 crisis provides a clear example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:19:35">[15:19:35]</a>. After Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and a plummeting S&P 500 (down 58% from its highs), the market bottomed in March 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:23:01">[15:23:01]</a>. Despite companies continuing to present weak results through the first three to four quarters of 2009, the market experienced an incredible rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:54">[16:04:54]</a>. This contradicts the traditional theory that markets anticipate events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:22:42">[16:22:42]</a>.

Instead, the market's rise, triggered by events like a selling climax or small news, changed people's perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:54">[17:05:54]</a>. Large investors, central bankers, and corporations, who look at the S&P 500 as a key indicator, began to regain confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:45:10">[16:45:10]</a>. This led to new investments, share buybacks, and injections of liquidity, stimulating the economy and restoring credit flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:14:42">[17:14:42]</a>. The S&P's rise, in turn, fueled this renewed confidence, activating the economy and returning everything to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:06">[17:56:06]</a>.

#### Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs)

A more recent example of reflexivity can be seen in Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:47">[18:09:47]</a>. When they began listing in Spain two years prior, housing prices were recovering, but the market was skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:17">[18:30:17]</a>. Initially, SOCIMIs were listed at or slightly above book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:56:39">[18:56:39]</a>.

In the first phase, as people perceived them as good investments, their stock prices rose to 1.2 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:01">[19:06:01]</a>. This allowed REITs to issue new shares at higher prices while buying assets in the private market at book value, increasing their earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:14:45">[19:14:45]</a>. Investors saw this as a "new paradigm," pushing prices even higher to 1.3 or 1.4 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:20:00">[20:20:00]</a>. Subsequent capital increases at these elevated prices further boosted earnings per share, creating a virtuous cycle where capital increases led to stock price rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:34:03">[20:34:03]</a>.

However, a recent period of "bad text" (likely referring to market downturn or negative sentiment) has caused these shares to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:59:44">[20:59:44]</a>. Now, if a SOCIMI raises capital when trading at 0.8 times book value, issuing new shares at low prices will decrease earnings per share, having the opposite effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:13">[21:39:13]</a>. This reversal highlights the dangers of such situations according to Soros's theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:51:00">[21:51:00]</a>.

Soros's understanding of reflexivity allows him not only to speculate but also to protect investments from adverse events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:15:39">[22:15:39]</a>. For instance, in an investment fund holding growth companies that acquire others (like SOCIMIs), it's crucial that growth is financed by the company's own cash flow and benefits, rather than through capital increases, which can create these "vicious circles" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:37:37">[22:37:37]</a>.

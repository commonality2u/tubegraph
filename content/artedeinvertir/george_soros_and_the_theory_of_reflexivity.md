George Soros is a renowned investor whose substantial wealth has been largely attributed to his theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Since founding his fund in 1970, Soros has achieved average annual returns of 25% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>. Notably, he has avoided significant losses during major financial crises and challenging market periods, including 1987, 1990, the dot-com bubble, 2008, and 2011, often emerging stronger from these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Like other great investors, Soros distinguished himself by adopting unconventional approaches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## [[soros_early_life_and_education | Early Life and Influences]]

George Soros was initially a Hungarian refugee during World War II, escaping the Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. His middle-class parents managed to falsify documents for him to emigrate to the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. With some family income, he was able to attend the London Business School, a respected institution at the time and still highly regarded today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Soros states that his true passion lies in philosophy, not investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. One of his mentors was the philosopher Karl Popper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. It was from this philosophical background that Soros sought to merge philosophy with investment, leading to the development of his theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

After completing his studies, Soros faced considerable difficulty finding employment due to a deeply xenophobic society <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. He initially took odd jobs, such as selling vacuum cleaners door-to-door <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>. His entry into the financial world came through meeting another Hungarian middle manager at a financial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

## [[the_evolution_of_soros_investment_philosophy | Evolution of Investment Philosophy]]

Soros began his career in finance as a value investor, focusing on cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Over the years, his philosophy evolved to maximize profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He gained a strong reputation by identifying undervalued German stocks in the 1950s and 1960s, particularly those with dual stock structures (common and preferred shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:03:09]</a>. His successful reports for clients ultimately led to their support in founding his own company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Soros's fund, initially known as the Quantum Fund, was established with just $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. It later grew to manage assets exceeding $30 billion to $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. The majority of this growth was organic, as the fund eventually stopped accepting external clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:04:04]</a>. The power of compound interest, combined with his consistent 25% annual returns over 40 years, allowed $23 million to grow into a fortune, making him one of the wealthiest individuals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:27]</a>.

Today, Soros operates across various asset classes, including currencies of liquid countries, common stocks, index futures, raw materials like gold and oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:34]</a>.

## The Theory of Reflexivity

Soros's core ideas on reflexivity are detailed in his book, *The Alchemy of Finance*, published in 1988 and 1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:33]</a>. This book is considered very complex, requiring deep financial knowledge and investment experience to fully grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:57]</a>.

### Human-Created Financial System
Soros posits that the financial system is a construct of human beings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:55]</a>. He argues that [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | financial crises]] cannot be predicted in the same way weather patterns can <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:06:15]</a>. If they could be predicted, they would not occur, as rational actors would prevent them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:22]</a>. He admits that some investors, like himself, may anticipate events at certain times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:34]</a>. It is extremely difficult to forecast economic behavior due to numerous interconnected factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:45]</a>.

### Perception vs. Reality
The essence of reflexivity is that it is more crucial to understand the *perception* investors will have of the economy, rather than the economy itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:56]</a>. Financial markets, he argues, represent a "common mentality" created by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:08]</a>. This concept links to quantum theory, where the observer influences the observed element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:20]</a>. When market participants form a vision about the market, they actively influence it, creating a "self-fulfilling philosophy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:56]</a>. For example, if an investor believes financial markets will fall and is a participant, their actions contribute to that fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:54]</a>.

### Market Instability and Biases
Soros rejects the theory of efficient markets, stating that markets are inherently unstable and biased, not stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:27]</a>. Participants act based on emotions, feelings, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:59]</a>.

### The Reflexive Process Diagram
The theory explains boom and bust patterns (bubbles) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Perception (Red Line) and Price (Blue Line):** The red line represents perception (not necessarily economic reality), which can be perfected over time about a sector or currency pair <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:21]</a>. The blue line is the asset price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:47]</a>. Soros does not use technical analysis; his speculation is based on fundamental themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Initial Phase (Period A):** People begin to perceive an asset (e.g., housing or related construction companies) as a good investment and that prices will rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:43]</a>. The stock market (blue line) lags slightly but then tends to rise much faster than the fundamentals suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:11:02]</a>.
*   **Test Period (Period BC):** In all bubbles (upwards or downwards), there is a test period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:16]</a>. Prices might stabilize or fall slightly (e.g., Spanish real estate in 2001-2002 after the S&P 500 fall) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:34]</a>.
*   **Reflexive Loop (Period CD):** Unlike classical theory where the market anticipates events, Soros argues that market participants *produce* changes in reality or perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:59]</a>. A price fall, if not too abrupt, can be seen as a buying opportunity, leading to another rally, often higher than the initial peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:24]</a>. For example, rising oil prices can lead to increased orders and profits for oil service companies, which then reinforces the perception of a strong oil sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:13:11]</a>. This reinforcing loop is where reflexivity produces a change in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:25]</a>.
*   **New Paradigm / Disconnection (Period E):** The bubble reaches a point where prices become completely disconnected from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:36]</a>. Small changes or news can then trigger enormous falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:46]</a>. The dot-com bubble's peak, for instance, coincided with Bill Gates stating Microsoft shares were overvalued, and the bankruptcies of companies like Enron <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:14:20]</a>. At this stage, the fall is irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **The Dangerous Phase (Period F):** Even as market prices fall, fundamentals may still appear strong due to prior capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:39]</a>. This is where "bargain hunters" or value investors, who focus on fundamentals, mistakenly see further price drops as buying opportunities, believing the earlier rally will repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:58]</a>. However, this marks the end of the reflective period, and further decline is expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:09]</a>.

## Examples of Reflexivity

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 crisis, particularly the bankruptcy of Lehman Brothers, saw the S&P 500 plummet by 58% until March 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:37]</a>. According to Soros, the market decided to rise in April 2009 based on small news, presentations, and capital injections, despite companies continuing to report weak results in the first three to four quarters of 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:16:18]</a>. This contradicts traditional theory that the market anticipates events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:24]</a>.

In this environment, investors and decision-makers (central bankers, large investors, corporations) observe the S&P 500 as an indicator of economic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:54]</a>. When the S&P 500 began to rise, people regained confidence, leading to new investments in capital expenditure, share buybacks by corporations, and liquidity injections by central bankers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:37]</a>. This renewed confidence stimulated credit flow and economic activity, even though GDP contraction was not disastrous (2.3% in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:18:02]</a>. This entire process is a prime example of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:06]</a>.

### Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs)
A more recent example involves Spanish REITs, or SOCIMIs, which began listing in Spain two years prior to the transcript <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:31]</a>. Housing prices were recovering, but the market was initially skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:34">[00:18:40]</a>.

Initially, SOCIMIs were listed around or slightly above book value (NAV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:19:12]</a>. When a SOCIMI issues new shares at a premium (e.g., 1.2 times book value) and uses the capital to buy assets in the private market at book value, their earnings per share increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:54]</a>. This makes the SOCIMI appear to be a "growth company," establishing a new perception or "paradigm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:17">[00:20:27]</a>. As a result, shares are quoted higher (e.g., 1.3 to 1.4 times book value), making subsequent capital increases even more favorable as they further boost earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:46]</a>. This creates a virtuous cycle, where share price increases upon capital increase announcements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:48">[00:20:54]</a>.

However, if the market perception shifts, as happened with a fall in the Ibex and decreased risk sentiment, SOCIMI shares can fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:21:11]</a>. If a SOCIMI then tries to raise capital when trading below book value (e.g., 0.8 times book value), increasing capital dilutes earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:48]</a>. Such situations are considered dangerous and to be avoided by investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:53]</a>. Soros's theory suggests that such investments would not be spectacular under these conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:59">[00:22:01]</a>.

Soros's theory of reflexivity is thus used not only for speculation but also for protection against certain market events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:15">[00:22:18]</a>. He cautions against growth financed by increasing capital, as it can create vicious circles, instead favoring growth financed by internal cash flow and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:36">[00:22:46]</a>.

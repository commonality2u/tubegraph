Renowned economist and investor [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] has recently stated that the new world order is changing, and the global economy faces significant, difficult-to-solve challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He warns that a serious economic and debt crisis is emerging, exacerbated by the current tariff crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This type of crisis, according to Dalio, is a "once in a lifetime" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Other economic leaders like Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Jamie Dimon have also publicly warned of these impending problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Dalio has indicated a specific date when the global situation could drastically change if necessary measures are not taken, impacting the value of money, investments, and currencies like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Background and Expertise

Ray Dalio is recognized as a leading expert on the global economy and one of history's best investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He regularly participates in high-profile meetings such as the Davos Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Starting from scratch, he amassed a significant fortune by founding Bridgewater, the world's largest investment fund, which currently manages over $100 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. His success is largely attributed to his ability to anticipate and predict economic crises, safeguarding and growing his clients' capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. Notably, he achieved excellent results during the 2000 and 2008 economic crises by anticipating these events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

After a prolonged silence, Dalio granted an urgent interview to CNBC, where he discussed the significant challenges facing the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He emphasized that current events, such as the tariff crisis, should not divert attention from the fact that without proper measures, the United States and Europe are heading directly into a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.

## Impending Economic Crisis

In his CNBC interview, Dalio stated, "We are witnessing the classic collapse of the major economic, political, and geopolitical powers. This kind of collapse only happens once in a lifetime" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. He likened the current situation to historical periods with unsustainable conditions, noting that existing systems are "currently broken" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

### Economic Indicators and Recession Warnings

A country is typically considered to be entering a recession if it experiences two consecutive economic quarters of decline in gross domestic product (GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Real-time data from the Federal Reserve, the world's leading economic authority, indicates an expected economic growth figure of -2.4% for the current quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Even when adjusted for US gold imports, the figure remains negative at -0.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. If this economic trend persists over the next 90 days, compounded by the tariff situation, it would officially lead to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Historically, a US recession has global ramifications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

Companies are bracing for a potential recession due to the political climate, which creates extreme uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Uncertainty is detrimental to capitalism, halting investment, increasing layoffs, and causing banks to cease lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

The CEO of Delta Airlines has commented on the "self-inflicted crisis," stating that Delta is "behaving as if there is a recession" and can no longer project growth for [[Ray Dalios economic predictions for 2025 | 2025]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This sentiment is widespread, with many companies announcing layoffs and workforce reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Bloomberg charts show that layoff announcements have surged to levels seen in previous crises (2000, 2008, 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Economic uncertainty is also surpassing levels seen in the 2008 or 2020 crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Recent data shows a shift to deflation due to consumers curtailing spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

A KPMG study of 13 top global executives revealed that 86% anticipate a recession as the most likely economic scenario for [[Ray Dalios economic predictions for 2025 | 2025]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## The US-China Imbalance

[[Key economic risks identified by Ray Dalio | Ray Dalio]] identifies the conflict between the United States and China as a difficult-to-resolve problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He highlights a crucial imbalance: the US cannot be a secure country if it depends on imports from China, while China cannot be secure if it relies on capital from the US and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.

Dalio explains that the US and Europe are currently "doomed" to consume Chinese products, and changing this dependency is challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He points out a significant issue in the United States: 60% of the American population has a reading comprehension level below that of an 11-year-old child <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. This, combined with China's 30-year economic planning versus the West's four-year political cycles, makes true independence from China very difficult for the US or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This shift in global dynamics is why Dalio speaks of a [[Ray Dalios perspective on the new world economic order | new world order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

In a recent social media post, Dalio warned that the United States must drastically reduce its fiscal deficit, or the dollar will continue to lose value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The dollar has dramatically lost over 7% of its value in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. He advises investors to reconsider their portfolio strategies to avoid high risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Dalio has specifically warned of a potential major debt crisis within the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in Challenging Times

[[Changes in Ray Dalios investment strategy | Ray Dalio]] recommends that investors adapt their portfolios to the upcoming economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Allocation

Dalio generally advises dividing portfolios into:
*   **Safe investments:** Traditionally bonds or fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
*   **Gold:** A portion (10-15%) to protect against inflation or geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, as it's considered the purest form of money not controlled by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.
*   **Stocks:** A significant portion for long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

### Current Challenges for Bonds

The current crisis has seen bonds fall in value, failing to provide their traditional refuge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This is partly due to China selling off US and European sovereign bonds, as China is the largest investor in American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The leading US bond ETF (TLT) has lost 5% in days and 50% over five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Central banks are hesitant to intervene by buying debt, as this could further escalate current high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. China has reduced its US debt holdings by over $400 billion in recent years, with over $50 billion sold recently due to rising tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### The Role of Gold

Geopolitical tensions are increasing demand for gold, which is now trading over $3,100 and has provided real protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Gold has appreciated by 79% during this period, while long-term US bonds, once considered very safe, have lost 48% of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>. Central banks are massively importing gold into the United States to protect themselves from the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, trusting the US as the safest place to store it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Stock Investments

Dalio emphasizes diversification for stock investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. He recommends:
*   **Six different economic sectors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.
*   **10, 15, or 20 different stocks** for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   Focus on **quality, well-managed companies with low debt levels** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

Analyzing [[Ray Dalios market predictions | Dalio's own portfolio]] (made public for investors with over $100 million) shows recent increases in positions in technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. He has also opted for defensive consumer companies such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's, and sought refuge in the resilient healthcare sector with investments in pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Merck, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as US health insurance companies like CIGNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.

Sectors most vulnerable to recession include real estate, technology, finance, and discretionary consumption (e.g., auto, airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. The best sectors for this environment are healthcare, energy, and utility companies (electricity, water, internet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. Dalio's portfolio strategy aligns with focusing on healthcare and defensive consumer sectors, which are also largely insulated from the current tariff crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.

Economic crises typically last 18 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. Dalio suggests viewing this period as a long-term opportunity to acquire shares in large companies at attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

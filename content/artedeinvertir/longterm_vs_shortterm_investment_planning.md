Warren Buffett, one of the most successful investors of all time, has become one of the world's richest people by starting to invest with just a thousand dollars. He has shared several key techniques for successful investing, particularly when starting with little money in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. His approach heavily emphasizes [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long-term thinking]] and patience over short-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Investing in Good Businesses for the Long Term

The first and most important principle, according to Warren Buffett, is to [[investment_strategies_for_longterm_growth | invest in good businesses]] that can generate a high return for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. This requires thorough research into a stock to benefit from its value generation over 10, 15, or 20 years, doing the work once <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Conversely, buying a poor-quality stock just because it's cheap, aiming for a quick 20-30% gain, means you immediately have to sell it. Such stocks won't generate much [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long-term value]], forcing continuous work and preventing the benefit of compounding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Identifying a Good Business: The Moat (Competitive Advantage)

A "good business" is defined by its "moat," or competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This refers to something special and often intangible or qualitative that allows a business to prosper against competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This qualitative assessment requires human thought, as a machine would struggle to identify what makes a business truly good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

**Examples of Businesses with Weak Competitive Advantages (Short-term focus)**:

*   **U.S. Steel Corporation**: This is a typical steel manufacturing business with no discernible competitive advantage. Steel is a commodity, meaning the company doesn't control its selling price, which is determined by supply and demand on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Demand fluctuates with economic cycles. Consequently, over the last ten years, U.S. Steel yielded only a 13% return, which is very low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.
*   **American Airlines**: If American Airlines raises airfares by 10%, competitors maintain theirs, leading customers to choose other airlines like Lufthansa or Delta due to intense competition and ample supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Toll Brothers**: As a U.S. home builder, it operates in a cyclical business. It cannot freely raise house prices by 10% because other builders offer similar houses, and consumers are not loyal to the brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **General Motors**: With over 40 car manufacturers globally, differentiation is difficult, and customer loyalty to a single brand is low, as people often rotate car brands over the years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.

**Examples of Businesses with Strong Competitive Advantages (Long-term potential)**:

*   **American Express**: The credit card business is effectively a monopoly of three companies (Visa, Mastercard, American Express), unlike the thousands of global steel producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. It benefits from a "network effect" â€“ more businesses accepting a card attract more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. They can raise prices because their service (facilitating payments) is essential and convenient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>. American Express historically generated a 1200% return, multiplying its value by 13 since 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Google**: Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's partner, considers Google to have the greatest global competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:11">[00:04:11]</a>. Since going public, it has multiplied its value by almost 50 times in 15 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Google (and YouTube) controls major search and video platforms, allowing it to raise advertiser prices by 10% without many alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola**: A key historical [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] for Buffett, it's a consumer product with strong brand loyalty. When people think of a non-alcoholic soft drink, Coca-Cola or Pepsi come to mind <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This allows them to control prices, and even a 10% price increase is generally accepted by consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   **Nike**: Similar to Coca-Cola, Nike benefits from brand loyalty and limited major competitors (e.g., Under Armour, Adidas), allowing it to progress in the [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Disney**: Possesses iconic franchises like Mickey Mouse, making competition difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Consumers remain loyal, and Disney can raise prices for its products and parks (e.g., Disney World tickets from $3.50 in 1971 to over $160 today, a rate much higher than inflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. This pricing power, coupled with increasing consumer base, allows for consistent 5-10% annual growth via price and volume <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. This has enabled Disney to multiply its stock value by over 100 times in 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Apple**: Buffett invested $15 billion in Apple in 2016 when sales stagnated due to product renewal cycles and larger screen terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>. Despite market skepticism, Apple's strong customer loyalty and a historically low valuation of six times earnings (excluding cash) made it an attractive opportunity. This [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] multiplied by six times, becoming one of Buffett's best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:54">[00:22:54]</a>.
*   **Moody's**: Considered an impressive business due to its strong competitive advantage, predictable business model, and consistent growth through rising prices and margin expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. Despite a sideways stock performance between 2015 and 2017 while the broader market rose, its strong fundamentals led to its value quadrupling within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:10">[00:44:10]</a>.

> "When a company has done well on the stock market for fifteen years, ten years, twenty years, it's not due to luck. It's because it's a good business because it has generated value and has prospered." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>

## Understanding the Business (Circle of Competence)

Warren Buffett advises to [[stock_investment_advice | invest only in businesses that you understand]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Understanding a business means having certainty that its profits will remain the same or, preferably, increase over the next five to ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. This also involves knowing the market size in which the company operates and its avenues for growth (e.g., price increases, volume increases) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

*   **Contrast with speculative investments**: The example of Moderna, a vaccine producer, highlights a business where predicting future profits (five years out) is challenging due to uncertainties like new solutions or waning demand for boosters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Many people speculate on such stocks without certainty of future profits, leading to short-term gains but uncertain [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long-term]] outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

Buffett emphasizes remaining disciplined, not being tempted by greed, and only investing in what you understand, even if it means missing out on popular trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Over time, he encourages expanding one's "circle of competence" by learning about new sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>.

## Patience and Exploiting Impatience

Warren Buffett famously states that "the stock market is a mechanism to transfer wealth from the impatient to the patient" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>. [[bear_market_strategies_and_longterm_investment_opportunities | Patient investors]] with a [[investment_philosophy_and_longterm_planning | long-term vision]] capitalize on market panics and individual stock problems.

### Taking Advantage of Crises

During crises, such as the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, stock valuations plummet due to panic, even for non-cyclical stocks that shouldn't be severely affected in the [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. This creates opportunities for patient investors who can value assets and understand that humans always find solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>.

Buffett's [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] in Bank of America during the 2009-2011 financial crisis is a prime example. He invested over $5 billion when shares were $5, certain that central banks would rescue banks. He waited until 2018 for the stock to return to $30, multiplying his investment by six times over eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>.

### Leveraging Specific Company Problems

An excellent way to [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | invest in good companies]] is to wait for them to experience specific, temporary problems that cause stock prices to drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:23">[00:24:23]</a>.

*   **Volkswagen "Dieselgate"**: When Volkswagen's stock fell from 250 euros to 80 euros due to the scandal, patient investors who waited 3-4 years saw it return to 250 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola "New Coke"**: Buffett's first [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] in Coca-Cola came when the "New Coke" formula was unpopular, causing the stock to drop. Buffett reasoned the company could simply revert to the old formula, which it did. He bought shares at an attractive valuation and his investment multiplied by 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>.
*   **American Express Scandal**: Buffett invested in American Express after a client defrauded the company, causing market panic. He understood it was an isolated incident and the company remained solvent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>.

It is crucial not to be influenced by past price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>. A stock's flat performance for years doesn't necessarily make it a bad business, as stock prices don't move linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:42">[00:27:42]</a>. Similarly, don't feel bad about missing opportunities in businesses you don't understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.

## Do Not Be in a Hurry to Sell

Charlie Munger's advice is that "real money is not found in constant buying and selling but in waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The wealthiest investors achieve their fortunes by identifying investments that can multiply by tens or hundreds of times and patiently holding them while these companies generate value over the [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long term]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:20">[00:32:20]</a>.

*   **Wells Fargo**: Buffett invested in Wells Fargo in 1990-91 when shares were $2.75. Over 20 years, the stock multiplied by 10 times to $30. Despite periods of flat performance (e.g., 1993-1996) and corrections (e.g., 20% drop from $6 to $5.50), the underlying business fundamentals (earnings per share) continued to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. This highlights that while short-term market behavior can be capricious, [[the_significance_of_long_term_thinking_in_wealth_building | long-term]] stock performance tends to replicate business profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:34">[00:35:34]</a>.
*   **Costal Funds Investment**: An [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] in software in 2014 multiplied by 10 times, despite several corrections of over 20%, including a 70% drop in 2020. Patience and deep knowledge of the business allowed investors to endure volatility and enjoy significant returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.

> "You have to learn in the stock market to make money without doing anything... learning to be still is how you make money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>

The fundamentals (earnings per share, book value) should be the guide, not the fluctuating price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:43">[00:38:43]</a>. The stock market is there to serve you, not instruct you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:51">[00:38:51]</a>.

## Other Key Principles

### Enjoy Investing
Successful investors enjoy the mental challenge of learning about businesses and how they progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:48">[00:39:48]</a>. This curiosity allows them to identify promising companies and [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | invest]] based on their analysis, rather than solely pursuing quick wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:02">[00:40:02]</a>.

### Avoid Envy and Greed
Envy and greed are detrimental in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>. People often get "crazy" seeing neighbors getting rich from "hot" stocks, leading them to join fads that typically end poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:07">[00:41:07]</a>. During the dot-com bubble of 2000, many criticized Warren Buffett as his shares lagged behind the booming Nasdaq. However, within two years, Buffett's company's shares were more valuable than the Nasdaq's tech stocks, proving the [[investment_philosophy_and_longterm_planning | long-term]] wisdom of his disciplined approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:34">[00:41:34]</a>.

> "Investors get very excited in the long term, they look in the rearview mirror... I say I made a lot of money last year and because of my greed I want to make more money again this year and that is why they keep buying and buying those stocks that keep rising on the stock market." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:05">[00:43:05]</a>

### Be Sensitive to Asset Valuations
[[evaluating_longterm_stock_valuation_strategies | Valuation]] is crucial. Intrinsic value is the discounted cash flows over a business's remaining life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:12">[00:46:12]</a>. While subjective, it can be estimated using multiples. The goal is to buy when there's a significant difference between a company's intrinsic value and its market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>. Focus on companies whose intrinsic value is predictably increasing over time, as these tend to do well on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:45">[00:47:45]</a>.

### Invest in Companies with Good Management
Good management, especially when aligned with shareholders, tends to produce good long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:48">[00:49:48]</a>. This means evaluating a manager's actions, track record, and ownership stake in the company. Family-owned businesses or those with significant reference shareholders tend to outperform others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:38">[00:50:38]</a>.

### Invest in Yourself
The best [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] you can make is to [[investment_education_and_strategies | invest in yourself]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>. There is a direct correlation between learning and earning. Becoming an informed investor, rather than a "stock market tourist," understanding how it works, and continuously educating yourself, is key to success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:01">[00:54:01]</a>.

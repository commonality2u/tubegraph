The latest [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] data indicates a severe and seemingly uncontrolled situation, even acknowledged by the Fed. Central bankers have warned about their limited ability to manage it, leading to potential significant economic consequences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>

## Current Inflation Data and Central Bank Actions

The [[us_and_eurozone_inflation_and_interest_rate_dynamics | US inflation]] rate has exceeded 9.1%, which was significantly worse than anticipated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a> Forecasts suggest a potential increase of up to 100 basis points at the next Fed meeting, with a 40% probability of this historic hike. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a> A 75 basis point increase is already fully priced in, pushing the Fed's [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rate]] towards 2.5%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>

This aggressive stance may cause market friction and seasonal downturns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a> The Bank of Canada, closely linked to the US, recently implemented a 100 basis point hike, which the market had not anticipated, leading to significant effects. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>

### Yield Curve Inversion and Corporate Profits

An additional concern is the inversion of the yield curve, a historical indicator of impending recession. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a> Recessions negatively impact corporate profits, which in turn affects the stock market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> This yield curve inversion frequently occurs during [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | central bank interest rate hike cycles]], like the current one. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>

A contraction in profits is already evident, with S&P 500 companies showing correcting operating margins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a> While there has been a compression of multiples, the next phase could be profit compression due to economic recession. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a> China is already experiencing this, and US leading indicators suggest a similar trend. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a> Rising [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rates]] also reduce profits for indebted companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>

According to Goldman Sachs, most sectors are seeing profit contraction. The energy sector is a notable exception, growing profits by 1220%, but the majority of sectors, including financials, utilities, and discretionary consumption, are reducing profits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a> Technology, while still growing at 7%, previously grew at 15-20%, requiring valuation adjustments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>

## Expert Perspectives on Inflation

### Vicens Hong's Diagnosis

Vicens Hong, an investor with a strong track record in predicting macro events, believes [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] could rise further. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a> He states that central banks have limited tools, famously remarking, "The Fed is lying... raising [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rates]] now is like trying to remove the snow from the door of your house when it has snowed in hell with a spoon." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>

Hong argues that the current [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] problem is primarily a supply issue, not demand. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a> Companies are not producing enough due to past COVID-related disruptions and problems with production capacity and personnel. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a> The Fed cannot influence oil companies to extract more oil or gas to reduce energy prices, a major driver of high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a> Instead, governments need to act by incentivizing investments in the energy sector to lower prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>

Andrew Bailey, Governor of the Bank of England, concurs, admitting that "80% of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] is out of our control." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a> He explains that while the Fed can control demand by raising [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rates]] (making money scarcer and reducing consumption), the core problem is a faster-decreasing supply. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:23">[00:11:23]</a> Raising the cost of money for companies discourages investment in productive capacity and expansion, creating a vicious circle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>

### Fed's Dilemma and Asset Allocation

Vicens Hong anticipates the Fed will eventually have to reverse its [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rate]] hikes to support the heavily indebted American treasury. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a> If [[us_and_eurozone_inflation_and_interest_rate_dynamics | inflation]] remains high while [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rates]] stay low, financial assets and real assets (excluding fixed income and liquidity) tend to perform well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a> In such inflationary bull markets, stocks historically do well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>

Hong suggests that if the Fed capitulates and allows [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] to run its course (balancing through supply and demand over several years), gold would be a better investment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a> Gold has a high correlation with real rates of return of 10-year bonds; when real yields turn negative, gold tends to rise sharply. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>

## Nuances of Inflation Data

The "core CPI," which excludes energy and food prices, is a metric the Fed uses for [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rate]] decisions, as it cannot control these volatile components. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a> Energy is the largest component of current [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]]. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:47">[00:17:47]</a>

### Services vs. Goods Inflation

An interesting dynamic is the shift from goods-driven [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] during COVID lockdowns to services-driven [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] as economies reopen. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a> Initially, people consumed products (computers, phones) due to service restrictions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a> Now, with reopening, services like tourism and entertainment are driving price increases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a> This is expected to normalize as pent-up demand for services calms down and labor imbalances (e.g., in aviation and logistics) resolve. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>

The price of oil has dropped by 25% in recent weeks, and if this trend continues, it could help normalize the overall [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] picture, with future year-on-year energy figures potentially even negative. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:35">[00:19:35]</a>

### Oversupply and Falling Commodity Prices

There has been a shift from a lack of capacity to oversupply, particularly in the goods sector. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:31">[00:30:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a> For example, chip companies overproduced, leading to overcapacity and falling prices in the microchip industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a> Similarly, the market for commodities and metals has seen significant drops, with many at 2021 summer levels. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:47">[00:21:47]</a>

Despite current high [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]] figures, market expectations for the next ten years, as indicated by 10-year protected TIPS bonds, suggest [[inflation_expectations_and_their_impact_on_investments | inflation]] will return to its historical average. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a> This presents both opportunities and risks for investors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:50">[00:22:50]</a>

## [[navigating_inflation_and_interest_rate_hikes_in_investing | Investment Opportunities]]

Periods of market decline, like the start of 2022, historically lead to significant returns in the long term. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:08">[00:23:08]</a> Average performance at five years after such periods has been around 80%, and at three years, money has consistently been made. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:44">[00:23:44]</a> This is due to cheap valuations and low expectations, which naturally lead to improvement in subsequent years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:59">[00:23:59]</a>

JP Morgan studies show that when the market is at a reasonable valuation (e.g., P/E of 15, below its historical average), the average expected return for the next five years is around 10%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:42">[00:25:42]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:32">[00:26:32]</a>

### Small Cap Opportunities

Small-cap companies, particularly in the Russell 2000, have experienced drops of 30%, which historically leads to spectacular returns at 5 or 10 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a> Their current valuation (12 times earnings) is much lower than large companies and below their historical average, making them particularly attractive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a> Historically, small companies traded at a premium to large companies due to higher growth prospects and better management, but this trend has reversed, creating a historic opportunity. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:44">[00:28:44]</a>

In the 1970s, during a period of low growth, rising [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]], and [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | interest rates]], small caps were the best asset class, delivering 35% annual returns for six years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:42">[00:29:42]</a>

### Quality Companies for Inflationary Environments

Leading investors like Warren Buffett suggest investing in companies that require little reinvestment and generate high cash flow, especially in inflationary environments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:51">[00:44:51]</a> These companies can raise prices due to a lack of supply in their sectors, and their low reinvestment needs mean their costs do not increase as much. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:48">[00:45:48]</a>

Companies with:
*   High profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:43">[00:31:43]</a>
*   Low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>
*   Ability to raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:49">[00:31:49]</a>
*   Competitive advantages (moat) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:51">[00:31:51]</a>
*   Non-cyclical business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a>

are desirable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:53">[00:31:53]</a> Their valuations should be reasonable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>

Companies with very low reinvestment rates (e.g., less than 10% of cash flow, ideally less than 1%) are highly desirable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:01">[00:55:01]</a>

### Examples of Quality Companies

*   **Install Co.**: A Nordic company providing electrical, plumbing, ventilation, and refrigeration services. It operates in a fragmented, undersupplied market, acquires smaller companies, and has low cyclicality and debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:32">[00:41:32]</a> Its business model allows it to grow by acquisition even during crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a> It has corrected significantly, trading at a P/E ratio below its historical average. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:32">[00:46:32]</a>
*   **Allfunds**: A fund platform with extremely high profit margins (72% EBITDA), indicating a significant competitive advantage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a> It benefits from [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] because its revenues are a percentage of assets under management, which rise with [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation]], while its costs (personnel, technology) do not increase as fast. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a> It is currently trading at a P/E of 18, well below its average of 30, due to a significant drop since its listing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:17">[00:56:17]</a>
*   **Data Group**: A German IT consulting firm, leader in its market, with double-digit growth and healthy free cash flow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a> It has dropped 30% from its peak, trading at 11 times profits/free cash flow, which is historically cheap for the company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:36">[01:15:36]</a>
*   **Digital Value**: A company benefiting from digitalization in Europe, with good growth outlook and trading at compressed valuations (7x EBITDA, historically 8-9x). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:39">[01:41:39]</a>
*   **Autozone**: A counter-cyclical company in the funds that has shown growth even during recessions like 2008 and 2009. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:41">[00:36:41]</a>
*   **IAT**: A company manufacturing protective equipment for extreme sports. It is in an oligopolistic market where reputation and security are key factors, allowing for strong growth and expanding margins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>

### Cyclical Companies and Risk

Cyclical companies like banks, raw materials, insurers, construction, airlines, and car manufacturers are generally considered "to rent, not to own" in investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:59">[01:18:59]</a> While they might offer opportunities during specific phases of the economic cycle, they are inherently lower quality and are not ideal for long-term buy-and-hold strategies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:48">[01:02:48]</a>

It's crucial to buy shares in cyclical companies when the P/E ratio is low, as a high P/E often indicates that the market expects earnings to fall. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:22">[01:03:22]</a> For instance, temporary employment agencies are highly cyclical and suffer significantly during recessions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:31">[01:35:31]</a>

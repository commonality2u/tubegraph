[[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] has emerged as a prominent figure on Wall Street, achieving remarkable returns with her main investment fund, [[Cathie Woods investment strategy | ARK Invest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In 2020, her fund saw a 170% return, and over the last five years, it has delivered over 700% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. She founded [[Cathie Woods investment strategy | ARK Invest]] in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, and her firm now manages over $30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## [[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Cathie Wood's]] Investment Philosophy

[[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Cathie Wood]] defines herself as an investor in innovation and disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Unlike traditional investors who focus heavily on financial and accounting metrics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, [[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Wood]] prioritizes companies that are revolutionizing or creating new sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. Financial metrics take a backseat in her analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

Her two basic premises for investment are:
1.  The company must be revolutionary and transforming a mature sector (like Spotify transforming music) or creating new sectors (like Teladoc Health) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  The company must demonstrate high sales growth, even if it is not currently profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. She believes these companies are reinvesting earnings to dominate their markets, similar to Amazon's early growth strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. She avoids traditional, high-quality companies like Nestl√© because they operate in mature sectors with limited growth capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Key Investment Themes

[[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Cathie Wood]] focuses on six main investment themes:
*   Artificial intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Autonomous cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>
*   3D printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Financial technology (Fintech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

## Market Warning: Passive Management Bubble

[[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] has warned investors about a "major bubble" and "enormous risk" in passive or indexed management, specifically mentioning major indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and MSCI World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. She argues that these indices are filled with average companies and are designed for an inflationary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.

She predicts a shift towards a deflationary scenario due to high technological innovation and significant cost reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. In this future, she believes the market will favor highly innovative and technologically disruptive companies, like those in her funds, which are not typically included in these traditional indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. She does not believe the market is currently in an equity bubble but notes a lack of rotation from bonds to equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. She suggests that younger investors prefer stocks, cryptocurrencies, and housing, while fixed income and bonds have seen the most capital flow in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

Here are some of the main investment ideas within her portfolio, for which she targets a return of at least 20% for the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>:

### Tesla (TSLA)
*   **Weighting**: 9% of her portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
*   **Investment**: Over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Ticker/Price**: TSLA, priced at $850 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Revolutionizing the mobility segment with electric cars and autonomous driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
*   **Target Price**: [[Cathie Woods stock market predictions | Cathie Wood]] previously stated a target price of $7,000 per share for Tesla before its stock split <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

### Roku (ROKU)
*   **Ticker/Price**: ROKU, priced at $440 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: An innovative company in the smart TV segment experiencing high sales growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. Roku is described as the "Google of smart TV," helping advertisers and consumers find content <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. It holds the largest market share in smart TV systems and services, ahead of companies like Microsoft and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Expected to grow over 40% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>, despite not currently producing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>.

### Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP)
*   **Weighting**: 5% of her portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Ticker/Price**: CRSP, priced at $200 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   **Sector**: Genetics and DNA modification, one of [[Cathie Woods investment strategy | Cathie Wood's]] favorite sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: The company is in the development phase, with gene therapies that could cure hereditary diseases like cancer, heart, respiratory, or neurological problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   **Risk**: This is a very speculative stock; the company has not yet generated income, and its shares have multiplied by over ten times in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

### Square (SQ)
*   **Weighting**: 4.7% of her portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Ticker/Price**: SQ, priced at $220 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.
*   **Sector**: Financial technology (Fintech), another of her favored sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: The financial sector has seen minimal innovation in recent years, creating opportunities for companies like Square <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. Square offers online and physical payment systems in a simple, efficient, and lower-cost way for merchants compared to traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Growth**: The company has multiplied its value by over 20 times on the stock market in less than 5 years since going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Teladoc Health (TDOC)
*   **Weighting**: 4% of her portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.
*   **Ticker/Price**: TDOC, priced at $230 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Teladoc has revolutionized the telemedicine segment with mobile applications, videoconferencing systems, and a strong medical staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **Growth**: In less than four years, the company grew from billing $120 million to over $1 billion, an annual growth of over 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. The telemedicine market in the US alone is estimated to reach $250 billion in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Teladoc's current billing represents only 0.4% of this potential market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.
*   **Profits/Risk**: Unlike some of her other investments, Teladoc has positive earnings and cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. However, it has a demanding valuation, trading at over 100 times earnings, significantly higher than the market average of 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

### Invitae Holdings (NVTA)
*   **Weighting**: 4% of her portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Ticker/Price**: NVTA, priced at $55 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>.
*   **Sector**: Similar to Crispr Therapeutics, Invitae is making advances in genetics and DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Unlike Crispr, Invitae already has revenue and is expected to grow over 60% in the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. The company's stock has risen over 500% since 2018 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

### Zillow Group (ZG)
*   **Weighting**: 3% of her portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Ticker/Price**: ZG, priced at $140 per share at the time of reporting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Zillow is defined as a fully digital real estate agency, allowing users to buy, sell, rent, or finance housing through its platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. This approach drastically reduces costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Growth/Risk**: The company has grown at over 30% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a> and produces positive sales and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. However, its valuation is very demanding, reaching 100 times earnings, compared to a market average of 12 times earnings for this valuation ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

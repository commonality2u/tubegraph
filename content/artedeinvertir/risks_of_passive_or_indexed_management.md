Kathy Wood has recently emerged as a prominent figure on Wall Street, achieving a 170% return in 2020 and over 700% in the last five years with her main investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This success is partly due to her revolutionary investment approach, which differs significantly from traditional Wall Street methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Wood defines herself as an investor in innovation and disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>.

## Warnings Regarding Passive Investing

Kathy Wood has recently issued a warning to investors about a significant bubble and immense [[passive_investing_risks | risk]] within [[investment_strategies_passive_vs_active_investing | passive or indexed management]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This warning extends to major indices such as the Standard and Poor's 500, the Dow Jones, and the MSCI World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### Alignment with Other Experts

Wood is not the first investor to raise such concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Michael Burry, another renowned investor, also warned about a substantial bubble forming in these financial products, suggesting it could overshadow the [[stock_market_risks and historical comparisons | financial crisis of 2008]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Index Composition and Market Conditions

According to Wood, indices like the Standard and Poor's 500 are largely composed of average companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. She notes that these indices were designed for an inflationary environment, similar to what has been experienced in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. However, Wood believes the market is heading towards a deflationary scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This shift is attributed to significant technological innovation and substantial cost reductions across various economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Future Market Scenario

Wood's forecast indicates that when these indices perform poorly and the bubble eventually bursts, the market will favor companies that embody high innovation and technological disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. She argues that these innovative companies, which are typically not included in current major indices, would be less affected in such a new market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] The Shift in Investment Focus
> Kathy Wood stated in a CNBC interview that she does not believe there is an equity bubble until a rotation from bonds to equities is observed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. She points out that while older populations are drawn to traditional instruments like bonds, younger investors, such as millennials, prefer investing in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Fixed income and bonds have seen the largest capital inflows in recent years, and many experts agree that there is a significant bubble in these areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. Capital flows in recent years show bonds as the star asset above stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

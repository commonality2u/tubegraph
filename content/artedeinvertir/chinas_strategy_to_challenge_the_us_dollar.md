The US dollar, currently the most important currency globally, has begun its [[decline_of_the_us_dollar | decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This shift will impact currency values, savings, investments, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Leading investors like [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]] and [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Stanley Druckenmiller]] have warned of the dollar's future loss of value and have begun selling their dollar holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Dollar's Current Privileges and Challenges

The dollar's status as the world's reserve currency grants the United States significant privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. These include:
*   **Ability to Print Money Without High Inflation:** The U.S. can print large amounts of new dollars with minimal inflation because there is always global demand for the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. For instance, to solve the 2020 crisis, 23% of total circulating dollars were printed in a single year, resulting in only a slight inflation compared to other countries that printed money to solve their economic problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. For comparison, Argentina's central bank balance sheet increased by 80% between 2017-2018, leading to 60% annual inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew over 120% in less than 1.5 years during the 2020 crisis, yet inflation remained at only 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>.
*   **Lower Financing Costs:** The dollar's importance allows the U.S. and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries, providing a competitive economic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

China recognizes the immense power derived from having the world's most important currency and aims to end this status, aspiring to become the world's greatest economic power in less than five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

## The Rise of the BRICS Alliance

A new power group, [[impact_of_brics_alliance_on_global_currency_dynamics | BRICS]] (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), has formed to counteract the G7, which previously held global power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>.
*   **Demographic and Economic Might:** BRICS groups 43% of the world's population, compared to the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Growing Influence:** More countries are joining BRICS to escape the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Open Challenge to the Dollar:** The BRICS group no longer conceals its plans to end the dollar's power, as openly stated by Brazil's newly elected president, Lula da Silva, whose views are often considered indicative of China's intentions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

## China's De-Dollarization Strategy

A new paradigm shift began quietly at the 2022 [[impact_of_brics_alliance_on_global_currency_dynamics | BRICS Summit]], where a roadmap to end the dollar's dominance was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. China is poised to be the primary beneficiary of this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Key Elements of the Strategy

1.  **Promoting the Yuan (Renminbi):** The Chinese Renminbi is gaining market share internationally, notably doubling its international market share from 2% to 4% since the start of the conflict in Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.
2.  **Internal BRICS Trade in Local Currencies:** The [[impact_of_brics_alliance_on_global_currency_dynamics | BRICS alliance]] proposes to trade within its territory using their own currencies, excluding the dollar. This would increase the value and international demand for these currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
3.  **Military Supremacy:** Historically, world reserve currencies have been associated with military supremacy that guarantees economic security <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. China is investing heavily in its military capabilities, with spending rapidly approaching that of the United States. It is estimated that China's annual military expenditure will exceed $500 billion within five years, surpassing the U.S <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>.
4.  **Free Trade Area:** China intends to create a large, tax-free free trade area among all countries joining the [[impact_of_brics_alliance_on_global_currency_dynamics | BRICS alliance]]. This macro-area could include over 60% of the world's population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

## Economic Implications and Investor Views

The value of the dollar on the stock market has begun to decline sharply following the design of this new roadmap by the BRICS countries. The Dollar Index plummeted more than 13% in less than nine months, an historic move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

[[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]], a prominent investor, explains in his book *The New World Order* that major economic indicators show China in a total phase of ascent while the United States is in [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | decline]], which will lead to the dollar's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. He advises investors to protect against the dollar's fall by investing in gold, which he considers the purest form of money that cannot be printed and protects against currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.

[[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Stanley Druckenmiller]], an expert on currency values, also expressed a lack of confidence in the Federal Reserve and current U.S. economic actions. He views selling dollars and buying gold as a good bet, expecting a fall in the dollar to cause increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. In such a scenario, he finds inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) from the United States very interesting, as they guarantee a return above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

### Investment Strategies for a Declining Dollar

Should the dollar decline, investors can consider several [[investment_strategies_to_protect_against_dollar_devaluation | investment strategies to protect against dollar devaluation]]:
*   **Gold:** Investors can buy physical gold, invest in gold mining companies, or buy gold ETFs (e.g., GLD in the U.S. or EGRN in Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   **Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS):** These bonds guarantee a return above inflation. Investors can purchase the bonds directly or through ETFs (e.g., SCHP in the U.S. or ITPE in Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Real Estate and Stocks:** In periods of inflation, real estate and stock market investments in shares have generally performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.
*   **Forex Market:** Selling the dollar against other currencies, such as the Chinese yuan, can be an option in the foreign exchange market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.
*   **Export-Oriented U.S. Companies:** Investing in U.S. companies listed in dollars with significant export components to non-dollar currencies can lead to increased profits as foreign currency earnings translate to more dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>.
*   **U.S. Companies with Exposure to China:** Companies with high export exposure to the Chinese economy would benefit from an economic boom in China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Examples include casinos like Wynn and Las Vegas Sands, and technology/semiconductor companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>.
*   **Luxury Sector Companies:** Luxury brands (e.g., Louis Vuitton, Hermes, Ferrari) benefit from Chinese consumers. An economic boom in China would increase their sales, translating into higher euro or dollar profits and providing coverage against a dollar decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.

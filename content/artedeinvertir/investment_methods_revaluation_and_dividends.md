Many people often wonder if it's possible to live off the stock market and achieve a predictable and increasing income over time. The answer is yes, but with certain nuances. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a> In the stock market, there are two primary ways to make money from stocks: revaluation and dividends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>

## Revaluation

The first and most common method is revaluation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a> This involves buying a stock with the intention of selling it at a higher price in the future. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>

### Challenges of Revaluation
*   **Dependency on Other Investors:** This method requires other investors to be willing to pay more for your stocks in the future. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>
*   **Unpredictable and Volatile Results:** The timing of market recognition for a stock's value can vary significantly, sometimes taking months, other times years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>

## Dividends

A second, more predictable way to generate income from the stock market is through dividends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a> Certain companies periodically distribute a significant portion of their business profits to their shareholders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>

### Advantages of Dividends
*   **Independence from Market Demand:** This [[investment strategies and advice | investment method]] does not rely on other investors being willing to pay more for shares in the future. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>
*   **Predictable Income:** By analyzing a company's ability to generate profits and distribute stable and growing dividends, investors can achieve more predictable income. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a> This can help in reaching a daily profitability target, such as $100 or €100. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>
*   **Crisis Resistance:** Many companies with strong dividend track records have continued to pay stable and growing dividends even during economic crises, such as those in 2000, 2008, and 2020. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>
*   **Long-Term Revaluation Component:** Companies often reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business to foster future growth, leading to a long-term revaluation component in addition to dividends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>

## Building a Dividend Investment Portfolio

Academic studies suggest guidelines for constructing a dividend-focused [[rebalancing investment portfolios | investment portfolio]] to achieve profitability objectives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>

### Portfolio Diversification
*   **Sector Diversification:** Invest in at least six different sectors. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>
*   **Number of Stocks:** A portfolio should ideally contain between 15 and 20 stocks that meet the dividend profitability objective. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
*   **Holistic View:** It's important to view the portfolio as a whole, understanding that some stocks may increase dividends more than expected, while others might reduce them. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>

### Investment Philosophy
The focus of this [[investment strategies and philosophies | investment philosophy]] is on the dividends a company will pay in the future, rather than short-term stock market price fluctuations. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a> By selecting companies with a high capacity to generate profits and pay high dividends, optimal performance can be achieved. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>

## Finding Dividend Stocks

Free tools can assist in identifying stocks with desired characteristics for dividend investing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>

### Using `investing.com` Stock Screener
1.  Navigate to the "Tool" section and select "Stock Screener". <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>
2.  Filter by country and desired dividend profitability objectives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>
3.  **Dividend Yield Filter:** Set between 6% and 10%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>
    *   Dividends above 10% are often unsustainable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>
    *   Yields below 6% might require significantly more capital to reach the target daily profitability. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>
4.  **Dividend Growth Filter:** Limit the low range to 0% (avoiding companies that reduced dividends) and the top range to 10% average annual growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a> Aggressive growth (>10%) alongside high yield is rare. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>

### Examples of Companies from Screener
*   AT&T (telecommunications) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:57">[00:04:57]</a>
*   Las Vegas Sands (casino) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>
*   Iron Mountain (document storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>
*   Canadian Market examples: Pexar Royalties, Chartwell Retirement Residences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>

## Capital Required for Target Profitability

To achieve a target average daily profitability of $100 or €100 (equivalent to $3,000/month or $36,000/year), a realistic dividend yield objective is between 6% and 8% per year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>

*   **Yields < 6%:** Require much more capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>
*   **Yields > 8% (e.g., 10-12%):** Often not stable and prone to cuts during crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>

### Calculation for Target Capital
The ideal portfolio should aim for an average dividend yield of around 7%, diversified across different sectors and comprising 15-20 stocks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>

The formula to calculate the capital needed is:
1 / (Expected Portfolio Profitability) * (Annual Benefit Target) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>

For a target of $36,000 annually and a 7% average portfolio yield:
1 / 0.07 * $36,000 = $504,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>

Thus, approximately $504,000 would be needed to achieve an average daily profitability of $100. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>

The two main variables are the expected average daily performance and the portfolio's capacity to generate returns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a> Increasing portfolio profitability or decreasing the daily performance expectation (e.g., to $50) would reduce the required capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

### Collection Process
Companies automatically send dividend money to your third-party broker account where shares are deposited. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a> Payments can occur monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>

### Taxation
Dividends are generally taxed between 20% and 25% in most countries. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>

*   **Withholding Tax (Double Taxation):** Receiving dividends from outside your country of tax residence can lead to "withholding tax," resulting in double taxation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a> Recovering this can be complex and bureaucratic. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>
*   **US Stocks Solution:** For US stocks, the W8BN form offered by many brokers (e.g., Interactive Brokers) can prevent this double taxation, ensuring dividends are received without additional capital loss. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>

Short selling is an investment strategy that allows investors to profit when the market or a particular stock declines in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. This method is considered much more dangerous than going long (buying a stock with the hope it will rise) and is not recommended for beginner investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:18">[02:04:18]</a>.

## How Short Selling Works

The process involves a broker lending shares of a certain value to an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:09">[01:41:09]</a>. The investor then sells these borrowed shares in the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | market]] with the expectation that their price will fall in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:48">[01:44:48]</a>. If the price drops, the investor buys the shares back at a lower price, makes a profit, and returns the borrowed shares to the broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:04">[01:47:04]</a>. While seemingly complicated in theory, in practice, it involves initiating a position by clicking a "sell" button rather than a "buy" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:06">[01:56:06]</a>.

## Key Risks of Short Selling

There are two primary reasons why shorting a stock is significantly riskier than buying:

### 1. Unlimited Potential Loss
When shorting a stock, the potential profit is limited to 100% (if the stock's price falls to zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:48">[02:14:48]</a>. However, the potential loss is unlimited because a stock's price can theoretically multiply by hundreds or thousands of percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:15">[02:19:15]</a>. In contrast, when an investor buys a stock (goes long), their potential loss is limited to the initial investment, while potential gains are unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:32">[02:32:32]</a>.

### 2. Costs of Short Selling
Time works against short sellers due to associated costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>:
*   **Dividends**: If the shorted stock pays dividends, the short seller must pay those dividends back to the party who lent them the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:17">[02:44:17]</a>.
*   **Interest**: The broker charges annual interest for lending the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>.

The longer it takes for the stock to drop, the higher the costs of maintaining the short position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:01">[02:56:01]</a>.

## Jean Chanos: A Legendary Short Seller

Jean Chanos is a legendary investor renowned for generating annual returns over 20% by investing against the market and individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He has achieved an annual return over 22% for more than 35 years for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:09">[00:55:09]</a>. An initial investment of $10,000 at the start of his career grew to over $1.2 million, significantly outperforming the general [[stock_market_risks_and_historical_comparisons | stock market]] where the same investment would have become only $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. Chanos manages over $7 billion for clients, and his personal fortune is estimated at over $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>.

### Chanos's Track Record of Successful Short Positions
Chanos has a tremendous track record of success in shorting stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:07">[03:07:07]</a>:
*   **Wirecard**: He was short on Wirecard shares, a company involved in Germany's largest stock fraud, making over $100 million on this operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Luckin Coffee**: Chanos was short on Luckin Coffee shares, a major stock scam in China, which saw its shares fall more than 90% when the fraud was uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Enron**: One of his most successful operations was the fall of Enron, the largest case of stock fraud in USA history, where he earned over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:00">[03:43:00]</a>.

## Jean Chanos's Current Bearish Outlook and Short Positions

Jean Chanos has stated that the current [[current_economic_risks_for_the_stock_market | market]] offers one of the best bearish opportunities of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

### Reasons for His Negative Market View
He cites two main reasons for his skepticism about the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>:
1.  **Profitability Concerns**: He is skeptical about corporate profits in 2021 and would be surprised if they returned to 2019 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Chanos believes that company profitability drives long-term share performance, so if 2021 profits don't recover to 2019 levels, recent [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | stock market]] increases may be ephemeral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
2.  **New Debt Issuance**: He is concerned about the new debt issuance by central banks worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Chanos observes that this monetary experiment has primarily benefited a small portion of society that owns financial assets like stocks, while the majority have not benefited but will have to pay for this new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This could lead to new regulations or increased taxes, negatively impacting corporate profitability and, consequently, the future behavior of the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

### Specific Shorted Stocks
In a recent interview, Chanos detailed the main stocks he is currently shorting and his reasons for doing so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

#### [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] (TSLA)
Tesla shares represent one of Chanos's main short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. At a price of $1,500 per share, Tesla is one of the most popular stocks in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>.

Chanos's reasons for shorting [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]]:
*   **Symbol of Bull Market Dreams**: [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] has "personified the dreams and aspirations of this bull market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Profitability and High Debt**: He states [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] is not a profitable company and carries a lot of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Increasing Competition**: The company faces increasing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Accounting Practices**: Chanos alleges [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] manipulates its results through aggressive accounting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Non-existent Autonomous Driving Technology**: He claims [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] sells autonomous driving technology that does not yet exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Tax Credits**: Excluding tax credits obtained from governments, [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]]'s accounts would show a negative result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Stagnant Sales**: [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]]'s sales have been stagnant for nearly two years around 90,000 units per quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:00">[06:09:00]</a>. While Model 3 sales are growing, sales of original ES and Eo X models are falling sharply (45% year-over-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

While acknowledging Chanos's opinion, it's noted that [[short_positions_on_tesla_and_amazon | Tesla]] is a leading company in the transition to electric cars but faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>.

#### Uber (UBER)
Chanos has also shorted Uber, listed under ticker VR at $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>.

The two main risks Chanos cites for Uber shares are:
1.  **New Regulations**: Regulations aimed at preventing the company from taking advantage of low-cost companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.
2.  **Low Profitability**: Despite significant sales growth over the last five years, Uber's losses have grown exponentially, reaching over $8 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>. The market currently assigns a value of over $55 billion to Uber, even though it's unclear when it will generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

#### Food Delivery Companies
Chanos mentioned also shorting shares of food delivery companies like Grubhub (GRUB) and Just Eat for the same reasons as Uber: new regulations and the low profitability of their business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

## General Investment Advice
Investors do not need to have an opinion on all 10,000 shares listed on the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. It is recommended to invest only in what one understands, has analyzed, and has confidence in for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. If something is unclear, it is best to stay out of it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:10:00">[07:10:00]</a>.

## Current Market Sentiment

The market is currently polarized, exhibiting both euphoria in some sectors and pessimism in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. Overall, the market is slightly more expensive than its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This is influenced by low interest rates, the Federal Reserve (Fed) injecting money, and positive outlooks from vaccine developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

## Understanding Market Fluctuations

When analyzing if the market is expensive or cheap, it's important to consider various factors that can affect it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. There is a "dichotomy of the market," where some areas are very expensive and speculative, while others are very cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Short-Term Speculation
> Companies trading at 30 or 40 times sales without profits are considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. The current market situation includes examples like Nikola and QuantumScape, which are valued highly despite zero sales or unproven technology, often fueled by speculation and low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:18">[00:39:18]</a>. This contrasts sharply with fundamentally strong, but less "fashionable," companies that trade at much lower valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:08">[00:39:08]</a>.

## Historical Context of Volatility

Market volatility is a constant factor in investing. Historically:
-   A market fall of 10% occurs approximately every 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>.
-   A fall greater than 20% occurs approximately every 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:29">[01:18:29]</a>.
-   Major drops of 40-50% occur every 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:53">[01:18:53]</a>.
-   Even in bullish years, an intra-annual drop of at least 7-8% is practically guaranteed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>. For instance, in 1997-1998, there was a 20% intra-annual drop, yet the S&P 500 recovered to end the year 27% positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:59">[01:30:59]</a>.

It is very difficult to predict market crises consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.

## Strategies for Navigating Volatility

> [!INFO] General Advice
> Both investing and speculating can be profitable, but it is crucial to understand what you are doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:05">[01:35:05]</a>. The goal is to have a "more or less clear vision of the sales and profits and how the company will be in 5 or 10 years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.

### Maintaining Liquidity
One strategy is to maintain some liquidity (e.g., 10-20% in funds, and personally) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>. This allows for buying opportunities when the market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:41">[01:19:41]</a>.

### Long-Term Perspective and Portfolio Diversification
-   Adopt a long-term view (3-5 years, or even 5-10 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>.
-   Build a diversified portfolio of 15-20-30 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:45">[00:50:45]</a>. Beginners might start with 20-25 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:25">[01:13:25]</a>. This "safe way to start" helps manage risk, as some investments will perform well even if others don't <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:27">[01:13:27]</a>.
-   Focus on companies with good prospects and reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:01">[01:23:01]</a>.
-   Do not overreact by selling during market drops; instead, identify good opportunities to buy from your watchlist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:50">[01:19:50]</a>. This rotational strategy has historically benefited funds, leading to new highs after market rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:08">[01:20:08]</a>.

### Avoiding Speculation and Euphoria
-   Avoid buying only "fashionable" stocks that have already multiplied many times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>. Such behavior is a "likely recipe for having a bad experience" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.
-   Do not give in to greed or the desire to "get rich overnight" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>.
-   For new investors, it's crucial to start slowly and build confidence through small victories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>. This fosters a belief that the [[stock market volatility and investment strategies | stock market]] is a legitimate way to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:59">[01:16:59]</a>.

### The Role of the Federal Reserve
The Fed significantly controls the market through liquidity management, interest rates, and quantitative easing (printing money) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. Historically, when the market has fallen, the Fed has intervened to ease money or lower rates, leading to rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:23">[01:24:23]</a>. If the Fed's narrative changes, it could cause significant market shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>, particularly affecting highly valued, more speculative segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:05">[01:25:05]</a>. Recent capital inflows into the market are also noted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:58">[01:25:58]</a>.

### Valuation Metrics
-   When valuing companies, consider their future sales and profits over a 5-10 year horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:22">[01:24:22]</a>.
-   The current S&P 500's P/E ratio is around 22 times future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:16">[01:21:16]</a>. Given current valuations, the expected return of the S&P 500 in the next 5 years could be close to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. This suggests that the current market is more suited for [[investment_strategies_during_market_volatility | stock picking]] rather than passive index investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.
-   A general rule of thumb states that paying more than 10 times sales for a company does not typically yield good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:24">[01:51:24]</a>.

## Learning and Education
Learning about finance and investing is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. There are many resources available, including online courses, books, and YouTube channels, to help understand how to approach investments, find information, and analyze companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. The key is to avoid naivety and understand that generating wealth in the stock market requires common sense, rationality, and controlling emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.

After several months of caution and selling shares, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] has regained confidence and is making significant purchases, including an acquisition of more than $9 billion [00:00:09]. Among these notable investments is the buyback of shares in his own holding company, Berkshire Hathaway [00:09:39].

## Details of the Buyback
[[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] invested over $9 billion during the last quarter to acquire shares of Berkshire Hathaway, which are listed on the stock exchange under the ticker BR [00:09:39]. At the time of this investment, the shares were priced at $230 per share [00:09:50].

## Reasons for Berkshire Hathaway Buybacks
The decision to acquire a large number of his own company's shares is a strategic move that aligns with [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett's investment strategy]] [00:09:54].

[[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] himself provided insight into these buybacks in a statement sent to his investors:
> "Versa [Berkshire Hathaway] and buying back its shares and Charly Hose and I believe that Versa's shares are trading below their real value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

He further elaborated on the long-term vision:
> "Over time, we want the number of shares outstanding be smaller. If the difference between value and listing price continues to widen, we will be more aggressive in buying back shares" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

This indicates that Berkshire Hathaway acquires these shares with the intention of canceling them, thereby increasing the percentage of ownership for existing shareholders and enhancing the value per share [00:10:29]. The substantial $9 billion purchase underscores [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett's]] conviction that Berkshire Hathaway shares are trading below their true market value [00:10:38].

## Historical Performance Following Buybacks
Historically, when [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] has aggressively bought back Berkshire Hathaway shares, the stock has performed well on the market [00:10:48].

This pattern has been observed in several instances over the past decade:
*   **2011**: Shares were trading at a very low price, and subsequent performance was good [00:10:55].
*   **2016**: Similar aggressive buybacks led to positive performance [00:10:59].
*   **2019**: With shares below $200, [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]] again bought back shares, which was followed by good performance on the stock market [00:11:03].

These historical trends suggest that [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_and_cash_reserves | Warren Buffett's investment strategies]] in buybacks often precede favorable stock performance, reinforcing his reputation as "the Oracle of Omaha" [01:11:12].

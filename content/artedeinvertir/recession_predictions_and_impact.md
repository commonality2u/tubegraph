Members of the U.S. Federal Reserve (Fed) have indicated that the next recession is practically imminent, which could have significant repercussions on the stock market, investments, and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This perspective is shared by some large investors, with important statements made in Congress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Predictions on the Imminent Recession
A former president of the Federal Reserve in New York believes a recession is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. At a recent conference in Congress, Jerome Powell commented that recessions are "certainly a possibility" and that the Fed is "tremendously committed" to combating inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.

A figure referred to as "Big Dad Ley" (likely [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_recession | Ray Dalio]]) has stated that a recession in 2023 is inevitable, specifically within the next six months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This inevitability is attributed to the need for [[central_banks_and_economic_recession_forecasts | central banks]] to act on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. This aligns with [[predictions_on_2023_recession_by_druckenmiller | predictions on 2023 recession by Druckenmiller]] and [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | Ray Dalio's Predictions on Economic Crisis]].

Michael Burry has also recently voiced warnings similar to those he gave in 2005-2006 regarding the subprime bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. A year prior, he warned about inflation and advised caution with risky and leveraged investments, as well as Bitcoin, all of which have seen significant declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Burry compares the current situation to watching a plane crash, finding no enjoyment in his [[investor_perspectives_on_inflation_and_recession | investor perspectives on inflation and recession]] becoming reality, and he notes that this situation feels akin to 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

In testimony to the American Congress, Fed officials noted that external events make it difficult to achieve their inflation goals without causing a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. They highlighted dependence on external factors not controlled by the Fed, such as oil prices and geopolitical conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Economic Indicators and Market Behavior
The president of the Federal Reserve of Atlanta published preliminary data estimating that U.S. GDP growth in the second quarter might be around 0%, following a negative first quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Two consecutive quarters of decline are considered a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Historically, bullish cycles of interest rate hikes by the Fed have always culminated in some negative economic or financial event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>:
*   **1998:** Russia's bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>
*   **2000:** Dot-com bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>
*   **2008:** Subprime crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>
*   **1994:** Collapse of emerging countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>
*   **1987:** Coincided with rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>

The current bear market, which has lasted five to six months, is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. If there is no recession, the average market drop is typically 21%, but if a recession occurs, it can be much more severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. The average decline during a recession is 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. While steeper drops have occurred, a 10% additional drop is more likely than a 50% drop, unlike 2007-2008 or 2001, which had unique overvaluation and central bank failures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

### Liquidity and Market Correlation
Market liquidity is a determining factor in short- and medium-term market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. There is a high correlation between the global money supply and the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. When money supply is restricted, the market tends to move sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>. The Fed's balance sheet reflects that money deposited in reverse repurchase agreements (reverse repos) has skyrocketed, draining liquidity from the market since the Fed started paying interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This figure, roughly $2 trillion, is significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>.

### Investor Sentiment and Opportunity
Market sentiment is currently very negative, similar to 2008 levels, with the number of bearish investors at its highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This negative sentiment, however, creates a fertile ground for future opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. European consumer confidence is also at a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>. When sentiment is so negative, improvement is often imminent, leading to economic recovery and stock market increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:53">[00:19:53]</a>.

## Inflation and Supply Chain Impact
Inflation is influenced by bottlenecks in supplies and supply disruptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:27">[00:27:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. Commodity prices like iron ore, copper, aluminum, and steel have seen significant declines since May <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:52">[00:20:52]</a>. Copper is a key indicator of economic health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. While oil was the only commodity holding up, it has started to plummet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:22">[00:21:22]</a>.

Supply chain problems, particularly the cost of transporting containers from China to the U.S., have significantly decreased by half in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:41">[00:21:41]</a>. This moderation in shipping costs is expected to reflect in inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:02">[00:22:02]</a>. CEOs and directors of companies, like Darden, are reporting that the worst of commodity inflation appears to be over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:47">[00:22:47]</a>.

The Fed's goal is to bring inflation down to between 2% and 3%, which would instill confidence in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.

## Historical Returns During and After Recessions
Investing after significant market falls has historically proven to be the safest time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:01">[02:06:01]</a>. There is no historical period where investments made after massive market falls have resulted in negative returns over 1, 3, or 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:05">[02:06:05]</a>. The deeper the fall, the safer the investment tends to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:30">[02:06:30]</a>.

The average bear market lasts around 14 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:04">[02:07:04]</a>. Bullish cycles, however, last much longer, averaging 70 months (over 5 years) and yielding average returns of almost 300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:21">[02:07:21]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in a Recessionary Environment
When investing in a market anticipating recovery, stocks with low debt tend to recover more than the general market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:44">[02:09:44]</a>. Companies that reinvest heavily during crises also perform best during recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>, as it is easier to gain market share and acquire competitors at lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:29">[02:10:29]</a>.

Warren Buffett suggests that all assets are compared against the risk-free asset, typically the 10-year American bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:01">[02:11:01]</a>. The spread between the S&P 500's earnings yield and the 10-year bond yield indicates how expensive or cheap the stock market is <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:45">[02:11:45]</a>. Historically, high spreads have marked excellent times to invest, such as the late 1970s and 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:47">[02:12:47]</a>.

Currently, the S&P 500's profitability relative to the bond is one of the highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:01">[02:13:01]</a>.

### Sectors and Companies to Watch
According to JP Morgan, banks and financial services companies tend to perform well during periods of rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:43">[02:28:43]</a>. Conversely, consumer-dependent sectors like food, healthcare, and telecommunications may be negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:58">[02:29:58]</a>.

#### [[sectors_resilient_in_economic_recessions | Sectors Resilient in Economic Recessions]]: Examples from JP Morgan's Top Picks
*   **Fiserv (FIS)**: A financial services company that has seen spectacular returns historically. It operates in the growing credit card ecosystem, facilitating information flow for payments. Fiserv is a non-cyclical growth stock with high profit margins, even increasing profits during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:21">[02:43:21]</a>. Its valuation is currently below its historical average, trading at around 13 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:25">[02:50:25]</a>.
*   **Bank of America (BAC)**: A major U.S. bank that benefits from rising interest rates, as it significantly increases their potential profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:28">[02:53:28]</a>. While banks are cyclical, consolidation after the financial crisis has created a better ecosystem with less competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:03">[02:53:03]</a>. Its valuation is near its lowest point since the 2008 crisis, only slightly above the March 2020 low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:38">[02:55:38]</a>.
*   **Lennar (LEN)**: A major homebuilder, part of a cyclical sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:16">[02:56:16]</a>. Its stock has fallen significantly, trading at only 5 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:37">[02:57:37]</a>. The main risk is the sharp rise in 30-year mortgage rates in the U.S., which could lead to an excess supply of housing and a drop in home prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:32">[02:59:32]</a>. However, the U.S. population growth creates a continuous need for new homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:42">[03:01:42]</a>.
*   **Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)**: This company manages private equity assets and acquires private companies with debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:26">[03:15:26]</a>. The market is negative due to rising interest rates, which increase debt costs. However, its profits are still expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:06">[03:16:06]</a>.
*   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)**: One of Canada's top oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:01">[03:25:01]</a>. It has benefited from inflation but is now correcting as people anticipate inflation calming and oil demand dropping with a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:05">[03:25:05]</a>. While the market expects high profits this year, they are projected to drop significantly next year due to cyclical margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:01">[03:26:01]</a>.

Many stocks currently trade at very low multiples compared to their historical averages, indicating opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:23">[03:37:23]</a>. In times of extreme panic or economic problems, there are paradoxically more cheap shares available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:52">[03:37:52]</a>.

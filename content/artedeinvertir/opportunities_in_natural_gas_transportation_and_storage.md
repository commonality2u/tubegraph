Warren Buffett made his first major investment of 2020 in the energy sector, specifically acquiring natural gas transportation assets, taking advantage of attractive prices offered by the market during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This strategic move aligns with his investment philosophy of being "greedy when others are fearful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Investment Strategy

Historically, the energy sector has often presented significant [[investment_opportunities_in_raw_materials_and_commodities | investment opportunities in raw materials and commodities]] when market fear is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a>. In 2002, when the energy sector's valuation was at its lowest compared to the S&P 500, Warren Buffett made a substantial investment in the oil company Petrochina <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. He invested $500 million and saw his investment multiply eightfold in less than five years, reaching $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

His latest investment involves the purchase of Dominion Energy's natural gas transportation assets for $10 billion, which includes $6 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Following this transaction, Warren Buffett now controls 18% of all natural gas transportation lines in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:00">[04:13:00]</a>.

## Why Natural Gas Transportation, Not Extraction?

Warren Buffett's focus on transportation and storage assets, rather than natural gas producers, is due to significant differences in their business models and risk profiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Natural Gas Extractors
Natural gas extractors face two primary challenges:
*   **High Fixed Costs:** They incur substantial fixed costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>.
*   **Lack of Price Control:** Their profitability is directly tied to the volatile market price of natural gas, leading to unpredictable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>. This lack of predictability often hinders their performance in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Natural Gas Transportation and Storage Companies
In contrast, companies involved in natural gas pipelines and transportation offer several advantages:
*   **Fixed Rates:** They charge clients fixed rates for pipeline usage or based on the volume of gas transported, not the commodity's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:00">[03:33:00]</a>.
*   **Local Monopolies:** Once a main transportation line is established, it is very difficult for governments to grant licenses for competing companies, creating local monopolies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>. Monopolies generally perform well in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a>.
*   **High Dividends:** These companies tend to pay high dividends to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>.

## Reasons for Interest in this Asset Class

There are two main reasons for Warren Buffett's interest in this sector:
1.  **U.S. Production and Export:** The U.S. has become the world's largest producer of natural gas, largely due to fracking and sergas technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. The country produces more gas than it consumes, leading to plans for exporting this low-cost gas globally, which necessitates robust transportation infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.
2.  **Energy Transition:** Natural gas is a more affordable and cleaner energy source compared to coal or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. It is projected to experience significant growth over the next 20 years as part of the global transition to more environmentally friendly energy sources <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:52:00">[04:52:00]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in the Natural Gas Transportation Sector

Given their strong business fundamentals, attractive [[valuation_and_potential_of_natural_gas_stocks | valuation and potential of natural gas stocks]], and future prospects, several companies in this sector are worth considering.

### Kinder Morgan (KMI)
Kinder Morgan is the largest natural gas transportation company in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:55:00">[09:55:00]</a>, with the founding family still owning 14% of its shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:59:00">[09:59:00]</a>.
*   **Revenue Stability:** Only 2% of Kinder Morgan's contracts depend on the price of gas; the rest are fixed-rate or volume-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>. This insulates them from fluctuations in gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.
*   **Resilient Demand:** Energy consumption, including natural gas, is highly resilient even during crises, as it is an essential good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:45:00">[10:45:00]</a>. The company expected only a modest 6% fall in profits in the current year, primarily due to lower consumption during confinement, not gas prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:52:00">[10:52:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** In 2014, shares traded at $40 with $4.6 billion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:42:00">[11:42:00]</a>. Six years later, profits remained the same, but shares traded at $14 due to market pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>. For the current year, the company confirmed earnings of $2 per share, distributing $1 as a dividend, resulting in a 7% annual dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>. Historically, these shares have traded at an average P/E of 15x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. This suggests a target price of $30 per share, potentially expanding to $40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>.

### Cheniere Energy Partners (CQP)
Cheniere Energy Partners specializes in the storage and export of natural gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:06:00">[15:06:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic Role:** This company is crucial for the U.S. plans to export domestically produced natural gas, as it processes gas from a gaseous to a liquid state for transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:13:00">[15:13:00]</a>.
*   **Monopoly Characteristics:** Obtaining licenses for gas export terminals is extremely complex, making it difficult for new competitors to enter the market once a license is secured <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:00">[15:28:00]</a>.
*   **Demand Growth:** Global demand for liquefied natural gas is expected to continue increasing in the coming years, positioning Cheniere Energy Partners as a key beneficiary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>.
*   **Stability and Dividends:** 80.5% of its contracts are at fixed rates with an average duration of 19 years, providing tremendous stability and income visibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:01:00">[16:01:00]</a>. Its clients are solvent, large energy companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. The company has not been significantly affected by the current crisis, even increasing dividend payments in the first two quarters of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>. Profits are expected to increase by 5-10% this year, with an annual dividend yield of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:33:00">[16:33:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Stable and predictable companies like this typically trade at a P/E of at least 15x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:57:00">[16:57:00]</a>. The company estimates profits could reach almost $4 per share within three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a>. This projects a 3-year target price of $60 per share, plus approximately $8 in collected dividends, for a total value of $68 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:09:00">[17:09:00]</a>. Currently trading at $33 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:24:00">[17:24:00]</a>.

These factors demonstrate why Warren Buffett has shown significant interest in the natural gas transportation and storage sector, recognizing its strong characteristics and attractive [[investment_opportunities_in_inflationary_environments | valuations in inflationary environments]].

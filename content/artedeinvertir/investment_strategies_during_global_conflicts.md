The conflict in Ukraine has transitioned into an economic war, which is expected to affect everyone, regardless of their stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Finance ministers have already warned of the significant economic impact of the measures being taken by various countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Potential Geopolitical Expansion: China and Taiwan

A key concern is the potential for China to exploit the current global situation regarding Taiwan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. China considers Taiwan its territory, similar to Russia's stance on Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. In recent months, there have been military tensions, including 9 Chinese fighters entering Taiwanese airspace on February 24th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>, and a high concentration of military forces akin to Russia's buildup near Ukraine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. The Japanese Prime Minister has stated that if China invades Taiwan, Japan and the United States would not remain neutral <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The lack of military consequences for Russia's invasion of Ukraine could encourage China to act, posing a future area of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

## Economic Consequences of the Conflict

The primary economic consequences include:

### Rising Oil and Gas Prices
The tremendous rise in oil and gas prices is considered the main factor with the most weight in the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This rise can worsen existing inflationary pressures that have already impacted the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Historically, economic recessions have been closely linked to rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. When Brent crude oil (inflation-adjusted) has exceeded $100, it has often coincided with economic recessions, such as in 2001, 2008, and nearly in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. High oil prices lead to inflationary pressures, reducing disposable income, which in turn leads to less consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This directly impacts company earnings and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

### SWIFT System Exclusion
The exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international money transfers and trade, is a significant measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. While this blocks Russia, the German finance minister has warned that it would have serious economic consequences for Germany and the rest of Europe, and consequently for the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>.

### Sanctions and Measures
The United Kingdom was among the first to establish specific measures:
*   Banning Russia and its companies from UK capital markets, a main source of financing for Russian companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This limits the issuance of new debt and shares for Russian companies listed on Western markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   Limiting the sale of Russian sovereign debt in markets like London <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   Exclusion of certain Russian banks from the SWIFT system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
*   Targeting the Russian oligarchy, who control key economic sectors like oil, gas, banking, and transportation, and financially support the regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. Western countries are limiting the movements of these individuals to exert economic pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
*   Limiting the money Russian citizens can hold in foreign banks to $66,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   Banning exports of high-technology equipment to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

## Impact on Companies and Sectors

The conflict and associated sanctions have a varied impact on different companies and sectors:

### Negatively Affected Companies
Companies with significant sales exposure in Russia are particularly vulnerable. When the SWIFT system excludes Russia, a large percentage of sales could evaporate, and due to operating leverage, profits could drop significantly (30-60%) even with a 10% sales loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>.

Examples:
*   Greek bottler of Coca-Cola (significant sales in Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>
*   Carlsberg (high sales in Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>
*   Inditex (owner of Zara, ~10-12% of sales in Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:24">[01:13:24]</a>
*   Renault (significant car sales in Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:30">[01:13:30]</a>
*   Philip Morris <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:44">[01:13:44]</a>
*   Luxury brands like Ferrari and Louis Vuitton (due to exposure in Russian and Chinese markets) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:29">[01:15:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:31">[01:15:31]</a>. Louis Vuitton's Chinese market represents 25-30% and the Russian market 5-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:01">[01:17:01]</a>.
*   Visa and Mastercard (small percentage of sales from Russia) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:59">[01:17:59]</a>. While transactions might be limited, their global nature means the effect isn't as large as one might think <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:25">[01:18:25]</a>.
*   Industrial engineering companies with offshore engineers in Eastern European countries (e.g., Ukraine, Czech Republic, Poland) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:38">[01:18:38]</a>.

### Positively Benefited Companies
The energy sector is a major beneficiary of the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a>.

Examples:
*   **Cheniere Energy:** Exports liquefied natural gas (LNG) and has a near-monopoly on cheap shale gas from the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. As Russia's gas supply is impacted, US LNG exports are expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.
*   **Marathon Oil:** An oil exploration and production company that has benefited from rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:05">[01:30:05]</a>. It is returning capital to shareholders through buybacks, indicating management believes shares are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>.
*   **Raw material companies:** Such as fertilizer companies (e.g., Mosaic, Nutrien) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:46">[01:15:46]</a>. Russia is a large exporter of fertilizers, so its exclusion from trade benefits Western alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.
*   **Defense sector:** Companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman are expected to benefit from increased defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:27">[01:16:27]</a>. Germany, for example, is drastically increasing its defense spending and plans to double it in the medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:44">[01:16:44]</a>. This means purchasing advanced equipment like F-35s and F-22s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:58">[01:16:58]</a>.
*   **Government subcontractor companies:** In the defense sector (e.g., KBR International, Leidos, Jacobs, Halliburton) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>. These companies provide technological, logistical, and cybersecurity support <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:52">[01:17:52]</a>. They tend to be good businesses with reasonable profit margins and low investment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:15">[01:18:15]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies during economic uncertainty | Investment Strategies During Economic Uncertainty]]

### Long-Term Perspective
Historically, war conflicts have had minimal to no negative long-term effect on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:52">[01:59:52]</a>. While short-term drops of 10-20% may occur (like the 10-15% drop due to inflation at the start of the year), the long-term impact is not significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>. The stock market has even survived and prospered through events like World War II <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:26">[02:24:26]</a>.

### Avoiding Bad Short-Term Decisions
The key is not to make bad short-term decisions that could jeopardize long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:01">[02:26:01]</a>. Buying when the S&P 500 has fallen by more than 10% has historically yielded an excess return, with 86% of such instances showing higher returns two years later (often exceeding 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>. Patience is crucial, as fears in the stock market can last one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:00">[02:03:00]</a>.

### Psychological Resilience
Many investors become discouraged when the market drops, but those who build wealth understand that this is human nature and the world tends to move in a positive direction, albeit with volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:43">[02:29:43]</a>. A mental trick for successful investing is to prepare for things to get worse and for nothing to change in the short term (weeks, months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:47">[02:44:47]</a>. Mastering expectations is key to success in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:22">[02:59:22]</a>.

### Opportunities During Pessimism
When pessimism reigns, and bears outnumber bulls in investor surveys, it is often the best time to invest because stocks are cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:41">[02:59:41]</a>. These are the times to "earn money" in the stock market, not when everything is euphoric and valuations are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:25">[02:26:25]</a>. Learning to value shares and distinguish between expensive and cheap based on company growth, business quality, future growth potential, and margins is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:50">[03:48:50]</a>.

### Portfolio Management
*   **Diversification:** Maintain a diversified portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:52">[03:49:52]</a>.
*   **Liquidity:** Having some liquidity to invest during periods of panic is beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:24">[02:51:24]</a>.
*   **Focus on quality and value:** The best results come from buying good stocks with growth potential at a reasonable valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:14">[02:54:14]</a>. This strategy has been proven successful by investors like Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:18">[02:54:18]</a>.

### Specific Company Examples & Valuations

*   **Adidas:** An iconic German company that has seen its stock drop due to proximity to the German market and exposure to Russia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:52">[03:59:52]</a>. Despite short-term panic, it is a business that generates long-term value, has pricing power, and is undertaking a multi-year share buyback program <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:16">[03:46:16]</a>. Its current valuation is 20 times profits, historically trading at 25-30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:03">[04:03:03]</a>.
*   **Alibaba:** While less directly related to the conflict, its stock has been affected by Chinese market concerns, including delisting threats and potential new economic measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:56">[04:32:56]</a>. Alibaba is at an all-time low in valuation, trading around 11-12 times earnings (or 10 times excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:33:16">[04:33:16]</a>, despite historical trading at 30 times profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:31:16">[04:31:16]</a>.
*   **Genetex:** Manufactures anti-reflective car mirrors with patented technology, holding a dominant market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:36">[05:00:36]</a>. The company is also pivoting to rearview mirrors with integrated cameras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:13">[05:01:13]</a>. Its valuation is not overly demanding compared to its average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:26">[05:01:26]</a>.
*   **D.R. Horton (US Construction):** A cyclical business highly sensitive to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:33">[05:04:33]</a>. Such stocks can see long periods of stagnation even after recovering from crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>. Investing in companies like NVR Inc., which has a better track record and quality, despite being more expensive, has historically yielded better returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:08">[05:07:08]</a>.
*   **PayPal:** Has recently dropped significantly (60%) despite continued growth (20% excluding the eBay business) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:12:41">[05:12:41]</a>. This presents a potentially interesting opportunity.
*   **Franchise Group:** Operates in the restaurant sector, focusing on establishing a global franchise network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:12">[05:14:12]</a>. Franchise businesses perform well during inflationary periods as their income increases with sales while costs are assumed by franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:31">[05:14:31]</a>.
*   **Gold and Oil Companies (Cyclical):** These companies do not control the price of their commodities, making them doubly complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:55">[05:17:55]</a>. Success depends on guessing commodity prices and managing operational risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:21">[05:18:21]</a>. The strategy is to buy them when there is extreme negativity and low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:20:00">[05:20:00]</a>.
*   **Ryanair/Wizz Air:** Airlines, being cyclical businesses, were heavily impacted by the conflict, especially Wizz Air (Ryanair of Eastern Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:47">[05:18:47]</a>.

### Current Market Environment
The current market is characterized by a "bear market mentality," where everything tends to go down indiscriminately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:03">[05:56:03]</a>. Companies may publish good results but their stock prices remain stagnant or fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:16">[05:56:16]</a>. This is a "winter" period for the stock market, which is a natural cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:44">[05:56:44]</a>.

Small company indexes (e.g., S&P 600) have dropped significantly and are trading at low valuations, presenting potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:58">[05:59:58]</a>. In very bullish phases of the stock market, large, well-known companies tend to perform better due to new investors seeking familiar names <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:03:33">[06:03:33]</a>.

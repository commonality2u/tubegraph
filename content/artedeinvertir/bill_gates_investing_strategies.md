## [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates' Investment Strategy]]

[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]], widely recognized for founding Microsoft, is also an acclaimed investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08"></a>. His investment portfolio, managed through his holding company, exceeds $40 billion and is highly concentrated, with 80-90% of its value held in just six stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15"></a>. This portfolio constitutes roughly half of his total fortune, which stands at $110 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50"></a>. Historically, replicating [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio | Bill Gates' portfolio]] has yielded significant positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57"></a>.

As a major investor, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] is legally required to publicly disclose his portfolio positions periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11"></a>. His investment approach emphasizes several key characteristics, often shared by the companies he chooses:

*   **Investment in Market Leaders**
    [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] consistently invests in companies that are undisputed market leaders within their respective industries, avoiding second or third-best options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25"></a>. This focus on dominant players contributes significantly to his investment success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32"></a>.

*   **Focus on Predictable and Essential Businesses**
    Many of his holdings are in sectors characterized by predictable, essential demand, such as waste management and rail transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25"></a>. These businesses tend to be less cyclical and offer stable cash flows.

*   **Shareholder Returns (Dividends & Buybacks)**
    A common trait among his portfolio companies is a history of solid and consistently increasing dividend payments, often combined with share buyback programs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17"></a>. This indicates a commitment to returning value to shareholders.

*   **Prioritizing Earnings Per Share (EPS) Growth**
    While [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] does not exclusively target companies with high revenue growth (e.g., above 10%), a consistent theme is the pursuit of double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth across his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01"></a>. This suggests a focus on profitability and efficiency.

*   **Prudent Valuation**
    [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] avoids overpaying for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22"></a>. His acquisitions are generally at or below the historical average valuation multiples for those companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41"></a>. This disciplined approach to entry price helps mitigate risk.

### Top Holdings in [[top_stocks_in_bill_gates_portfolio | Bill Gates' Portfolio]]

His portfolio is highly concentrated in a few key companies:

#### 1. Microsoft (31% weight)
Microsoft is [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates']]([[top_stocks_in_bill_gates_portfolio | largest position]]), representing a massive 31% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47"></a>. His overall investment in Microsoft, including personal holdings, is estimated to be over $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:13"></a>.
Even after stepping down from daily operations, he remains deeply knowledgeable about the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17"></a>. Notably, he significantly increased his Microsoft holdings in 2022 when the stock price dropped to $220-$230, demonstrating a belief in its long-term value despite market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26"></a>.

Microsoft's business lines include:
*   **Hardware:** Such as Xbox and peripherals, which are more volatile but represent a smaller portion of revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:43"></a>.
*   **Office 365 Ecosystem:** This segment, including Windows, PowerPoint, and Excel, boasts enormous competitive advantages due to its network effect and successful migration to a subscription-based cloud model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09"></a>.
*   **Cloud (Microsoft Azure) & Artificial Intelligence (AI):** This is the crown jewel, with strong growth expectations of 15-20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57"></a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:33"></a>. Microsoft is a major shareholder in OpenAI, the developer of ChatGPT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09"></a>.

Historically, Microsoft has shown impressive growth, multiplying its value by 4,000 times since its initial trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08"></a>. While it experienced a period of sideways trading due to initial overvaluation (60 times earnings), it resumed significant growth after becoming undervalued (12 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14"></a>. Currently, Microsoft trades at approximately 30 times earnings, slightly above its 5-year average of 27 times, reflecting market enthusiasm for its AI potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:24"></a>.

#### 2. Berkshire Hathaway (20% weight)
As a close friend and admirer of Warren Buffett, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] holds a significant 20% stake in Berkshire Hathaway, an investment valued at nearly $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:25"></a>.

Berkshire Hathaway operates through two main avenues:
*   **Direct Ownership:** Acquiring 100% of private companies like Duracell, Geico, and See's Candies, as well as BNSF, a competitor to Canadian National Railway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53"></a>.
*   **Minority Stock Investments:** Holding shares in publicly listed companies such as Moody's, Apple, and Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28"></a>.

Berkshire Hathaway has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 across various timeframes with low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53"></a>. A key metric for valuing Berkshire Hathaway is its book value per share, which has shown incessant growth over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41"></a>. The company often engages in share buybacks, particularly when its shares trade at a discount to its intrinsic value, a strategy that has historically correlated with positive stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:57"></a>.

A notable feature is Berkshire Hathaway's substantial cash pile, exceeding $100 billion, which serves as a strategic reserve for future investment opportunities, especially during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:39"></a>.

#### 3. Canadian National Railway (15.7% weight)
This is a dominant rail transport company in Canada, which recently merged with Kansas City Southern to create a significant North American rail axis connecting Canada's southern region to the Gulf of Mexico in Texas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34"></a>.
Rail transport, though seemingly antiquated, remains a highly cost-effective method for moving heavy goods like raw materials (coal, iron ore, oil) and industrial merchandise over long distances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04"></a>.

The industry is characterized by high barriers to entry, making it a local monopoly, a quality favored by investors like [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio | Bill Gates]] and Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02"></a>. Canadian National Railway, like other major players in the sector, has demonstrated strong stock performance and low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49"></a>.

The company plans to reach $10 EPS within the next three years, with anticipated annual profit growth between 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42"></a>. It also consistently increases its dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02"></a>. Currently, Canadian National Railway trades at 20 times earnings, consistent with its 5-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33"></a>.

#### 4. Waste Management (14.5% weight)
[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] holds 14.5% of his portfolio in Waste Management, a company involved in waste collection and processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08"></a>. Despite its unglamorous nature, this sector is highly lucrative and controlled by a few dominant players, with Waste Management being the clear market leader <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07"></a>.

This business is highly predictable and essential, demonstrating resilience even during economic crises like 2007-2011, where it maintained stable earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25"></a>. The U.S. waste collection market is expected to grow by 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30"></a>.

Waste Management is making significant capital investments (up to $1 billion in 2023-2024) in the recycling and sustainable economy segments, anticipating accelerated growth of 8-9% annually and EPS growth exceeding 12% in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03"></a>. The stock trades at 25 times earnings, which is its historical average, reflecting its predictable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32"></a>.

#### 5. Caterpillar (4.3% weight)
Caterpillar, an industrial machinery company, accounts for 4.3% of [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates']]([[top_stocks_in_bill_gates_portfolio | portfolio]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20"></a>. It is a market leader in construction, mining, and public works equipment, benefiting from an investment deficit in infrastructure and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29"></a>. Both U.S. political parties have expressed intentions for significant infrastructure investment, which bodes well for Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04"></a>.

While cyclical, Caterpillar is the leading brand due to its technological capacity, quality, and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56"></a>. It has consistently paid and increased dividends for over 30 years and actively engages in share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24"></a>. The company has seen strong revenue growth in recent years (20% in 2021, 16% in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17"></a>.

Caterpillar's stock is currently valued at 13 times earnings, below its 5-year average of 18 times, making it an attractive valuation for [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21"></a>.

#### 6. John Deere (3.7% weight)
John Deere, an industrial machinery company famous for agricultural equipment, holds a 3.7% weight in [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates']]([[top_stocks_in_bill_gates_portfolio | portfolio]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28"></a>.

It is a "dividend aristocrat," having continuously increased its dividends for over 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40"></a>.

The company heavily invests in research and development, approaching $2 billion annually, particularly in artificial intelligence and automation for agricultural machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06"></a>. The agricultural equipment sector is projected to grow at 7%, more than double the general economy's rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44"></a>.

John Deere's stock is currently valued at only 11 times earnings, close to its COVID-19 lows and significantly below its peak of 25 times earnings in recent years, indicating a favorable entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44"></a>.

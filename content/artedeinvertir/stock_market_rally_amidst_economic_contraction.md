From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 
The [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]] has experienced a significant rally, rising more than 40% in less than two months, even as the economy faces one of its worst contractions, with projected falls of up to 9% in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This phenomenon has surprised many prominent investors, including Warren Buffett and Stanley Druckenmiller <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Reasons for the Market Rally

Despite the severe economic contraction, possibly the worst in 70 years, the [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]] continues to rise, approaching historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Several factors contribute to this counterintuitive behavior:

*   **Federal Reserve and Central Bank Liquidity**
    The primary reason is the decisive action of the Federal Reserve and other central banks to inject massive amounts of liquidity into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. Flooding the market with liquidity typically causes the [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]] to rise in the short and medium term, a trend observed for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Stanley Druckenmiller, an investor with historical annual returns of 30% over 30 years, admitted to underestimating the extent to which central banks were willing to intervene <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.
*   **Economic Reopening and Vaccine Hopes**
    The market is also exhibiting enthusiasm for the reopening of the economy, combined with the influx of central bank money and positive news surrounding potential vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Companies severely impacted by the economic downturn are showing signs of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Shift to Financial Assets**
    Even with economic contractions, companies and individuals continue to generate wealth and liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Faced with inflation (losing 2-3% of assets annually if not invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a> and high economic uncertainty, investors are opting for financial assets like stocks or bonds over direct investments in the "real economy" (e.g., opening businesses, buying rental properties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. Capital, being fearful, seeks safety during uncertain times, leading it towards technology stocks of large companies like Apple, Amazon, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. These companies are perceived as less affected by current problems, having little debt, and operating highly predictable businesses, which explains their shares reaching historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### Expert Observations

*   **Warren Buffett's Caution**: Four weeks prior to the rally, Warren Buffett conveyed a message of caution to investors during his annual conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. His purchases, despite significant [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]] falls, remained modest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.
*   **Stanley Druckenmiller's Humility**: The legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller stated he had been "humiliated by the markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He previously expressed uncertainty about the market situation and took greater caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Consequently, while the markets rose 40% since then, his portfolio only appreciated 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He admitted underestimating the central banks' willingness to cross "red lines" and the extent of their determination <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Speculative Frenzy

The recent market environment has seen a "frenzy of speculation," serving as a cautionary tale for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>:

*   **Zoom Technologies (ZTNO)**: Some investors confused Zoom Technologies (ZTNO), a company with no sales or profits trading at one cent per share, with the popular video conferencing company Zoom Video Communications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. This confusion drove the stock from a penny to $20 per share, only for it to fall back to 60 cents when the market realized the mistake, effectively becoming worthless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.
*   **Nikola (NKLA)**: Nikola (NKLA), an electric truck company, was renamed from a pre-existing company called Affection and Qiu with no sales or profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. The name "Nikola" was chosen to capitalize on the success and aura of Tesla, founded by Elon Musk, who named his company after scientist Nikola Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Despite having no sales or profits and only a promotional video and prototype, Nikola's shares surged from $10 to over $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Its market capitalization exceeded $30 billion, more than Ford Motor Company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **FANG (FTK)**: Speculators confused the Chinese company FANG (FTK) with the acronym "FANG" (Facebook, Amazon, Netflix, Google), which refers to a group of high-performing technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. This led to FANG's shares rising from $10 to over $100 per share, only for investors to lose 90% of their investment as the stock returned to its initial point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

These examples highlight the critical importance of understanding investments in the [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]] to avoid disastrous outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

### Investment Opportunities

The video presents three potential investment opportunities, emphasizing that investing should be based on smart purchases for the future rather than short-term market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

#### Volkswagen (VOW3)
*   **Overview**: Volkswagen is a leading global automotive holding company with over €250 billion in annual sales, producing 11 million cars, employing 600,000 people, and generating nearly €20 billion in operating profit annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. It owns brands like Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, Skoda, Seat, and Ducati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Porsche is its most profitable brand, producing over €4 billion in operating profits annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>.
*   **Valuation Methods**:
    1.  **Parts Valuation (if luxury division spins off)**: If Volkswagen were to independently list its luxury car division (including Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, Ducati), this segment alone could be valued at over €260 per share, using comparable brands like Ferrari (which has €1 billion operating profit annually compared to Porsche's €4 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41">[09:41]</a>. The remaining Volkswagen group would have an approximate value of €200 per share. This could yield a total potential value of €450 per share, significantly higher than its current €130 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    2.  **Earnings Multiple Valuation (if no spin-off)**: Assuming no luxury division separation, Volkswagen is estimated to earn €25 per share by 2023, similar to its 2019 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Historically, Volkswagen has traded at a P/E ratio higher than 8. Applying a multiple of 8 to €25 earnings per share gives a target price of €200 per share, an attractive potential given its current trading price of €130 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
*   **Risks & Strengths**: Volkswagen has low debt, has been slightly affected by the current economic situation, and is positioned to return to previous earnings levels in 2-3 years, having moved past the "dieselgate" scandal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. It is also actively competing in the electric car market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

#### IAG (International Airlines Group) (IAG)
*   **Overview**: IAG, listed in London and Madrid, is a holding company for British Airways and Iberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. The airline industry is currently in a complicated moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.
*   **Challenges & Risks**: IAG has received government aid from the UK and Spain, which its CEO believes provides sufficient liquidity for the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. However, demand for flights is not expected to return to normal before 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. The airline industry lacks significant competitive advantages and is cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Companies with low operating costs tend to prosper long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. IAG and Lufthansa have higher unit costs (close to 8 cents per seat per kilometer) compared to efficient operators like Ryanair (3.5 cents per seat per kilometer) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Historically, IAG has traded at an average P/E of 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>. With an estimated earnings per share of 80 cents, a target price for three years could be €5.60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. While the current price of €3 per share represents considerable potential, significant risks remain due to debt levels, cyclicality, and the potential for a second wave of the current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.

#### Qualcomm (QCOM)
*   **Overview**: Qualcomm is a leading manufacturer of microchips for smartphones and tablets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>. It has multiplied its value over 100 times since going public 30 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>.
*   **Growth & Shareholder Returns**: While the smartphone and tablet markets are maturing, future growth is expected from the 5G market, where Qualcomm has strong products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Qualcomm is a mature company with good shareholder returns, distributing most profits as dividends or share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>. Stanley Druckenmiller recently invested $30 million in Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: For technology companies, valuing based on free cash flow per share is recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>. Qualcomm's free cash flow is estimated to be around $6 per share by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:08">[00:16:08]</a>. Historically, Qualcomm has traded at 20 times its earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:15">[00:16:15]</a>. This suggests a target price of $120 per share in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.
*   **Strengths**: Trading at $84 per share, Qualcomm offers interesting potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:25">[00:16:25]</a>. It is considered a low-risk company, unaffected by the current economic problem, and has good long-term prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:31">[00:16:31]</a>.

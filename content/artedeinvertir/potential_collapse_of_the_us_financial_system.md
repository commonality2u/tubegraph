The clock has begun to count down towards a potential economic disaster, which could lead to the total collapse of the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Janet Yellen, the current Director of the American Treasury, has stated that if a solution is not found in the coming weeks, it would cause irreversible damage to the American economy and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Janet Yellen's Warnings

Janet Yellen, previously the Chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, currently manages over $4 trillion annually in her role as Treasury Director <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Her deep knowledge of the economy and financial markets makes her opinion on this new risk critically important <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:16">[01:01:16]</a>.

In a CNBC interview, Yellen described the periodic and self-manufactured crises resulting from putting an arbitrary debt ceiling as "tremendously irresponsible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:27">[01:01:27]</a>. She issued a warning that the extraordinary measures taken by the Treasury would likely be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:03">[09:09:03]</a>.

## The Debt Ceiling Crisis

The United States is currently at the limit of debt it can issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:55">[01:01:55]</a>. This problem stems from the US consistently spending more money than it earns, known as a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:46">[02:02:46]</a>. To finance this deficit, new debt is issued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:54">[02:02:54]</a>. The US established a debt limit many years ago, and it is now about to be reached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:08">[03:03:08]</a>.

### Extraordinary Measures

To deal with the debt limit, Janet Yellen has initiated the first desperate measures:
*   Significant cuts to investments in pension and health plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:59">[01:01:59]</a>.
*   Suspension of government investments for employee retirement plans, which will only resume if the problem is solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:04">[02:02:04]</a>.
These measures represent a spending cut of over $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:18">[02:02:18]</a>.

### Market Reactions to the [[Implications of the US debt ceiling crisis | Debt Ceiling Crisis]]

The financial markets are already pricing in a potential bankruptcy of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:16">[03:03:16]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDS), which are insurance policies against government debt default, have seen their price to insure American government debt multiply by more than nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:20">[03:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:42">[03:03:42]</a>. This indicates that financial markets perceive the [[Risk of US debt default and market reactions | risk of the United States defaulting on its debt]] as enormous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:51">[03:03:51]</a>.

## Global Financial System Interconnectedness

A country stopping its debt payments would lead to total chaos and financial collapse, especially for the United States, as the entire global financial system is connected to American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:12">[04:04:12]</a>. US debt bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally, reaching a figure of $30 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:24">[04:04:24]</a>.

As investor Ray Dalio explains, a country's debt is another person's asset, and millions of entities and individuals worldwide hold enormous amounts of these treasury bills and bonds, as they were once considered the safest investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:38">[04:04:38]</a>. A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect on banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:54">[04:04:54]</a>. This situation would be similar to the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008, but multiplied by 30 times, given the significantly higher balance of total US debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:05">[05:05:05]</a>.

## Potential Consequences of a Default

If a default on American debt were to occur, it would have severe financial implications:
*   The value of dollar bonds and fixed income would collapse due to loss of investor confidence and massive capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:25">[05:05:25]</a>.
*   The value of stocks and equity investments would also fall sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:35">[05:05:35]</a>.
*   The price of gold would likely rise sharply, acting as a safe haven, as its price is measured against the American dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:43">[05:05:43]</a>.

### White House Estimates on Impact

A White House report details the possible consequences of a debt default:
*   Over 2 million job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:20">[06:06:20]</a>.
*   An additional cost of over $750 billion annually in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:24">[06:06:24]</a>.
*   A collapse of the [[Decline of the US Dollar | dollar]] and the [[Stock market fluctuations and potential crisis | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:33">[06:06:33]</a>. The report estimates stock market drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:26">[11:11:26]</a>.

## Desperate Solutions

The most viable solution would be an agreement between Republicans and Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:42">[06:06:42]</a>. However, with political gridlock, desperate solutions are being considered.

### The Trillion-Dollar Platinum Coin

One proposed solution is to mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin, or even several such coins, to temporarily solve the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:56">[06:06:56]</a>. This seemingly "comical" solution is real and exists due to a legal loophole in American law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:22">[07:07:22]</a>. While the Federal Reserve is the only entity that can print money digitally out of thin air, American law allows the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:28">[07:07:28]</a>. These coins would be deposited into the Federal Reserve's balance sheets, allowing the government to use them as a checking account to continue paying expenses without going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:04">[08:08:04]</a>.

Although this solution could work in the short term, it would not convey a message of stability to financial markets and would likely cause the value of the [[Decline of the US Dollar | dollar]], bonds, and stocks to continue falling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:37">[08:08:37]</a>.

## Protecting Investments

In the face of this new risk, many investors are:
*   Betting against the American debt and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:33">[09:09:33]</a>.
*   Investing in gold, which benefits from this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:49">[09:09:49]</a>.
*   Sophisticated investors like Ray Dalio might buy Credit Default Swaps (CDs) to protect against default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:53">[09:09:53]</a>.
*   Stocks related to the gold sector, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would likely benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:06">[10:10:06]</a>.
*   Inverse ETFs against the market, such as the ProShares Short S&P500 (SH), which go up when the market goes down, are used tactically for short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:13">[10:10:13]</a>.

It is important to note that while a temporary solution was reached during similar debt limit scenarios in 2011 and 2013, the markets experienced high volatility in the following weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:11:34">[11:11:34]</a>.

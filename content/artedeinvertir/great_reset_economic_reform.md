From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

The "Great Reset" refers to a new economic scenario proposed by the World Economic Forum, which is expected to affect everyone globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This new economic reform has the backing of some of the most powerful people in the world, including heads of government and prominent businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The initiative aims to explain how it will affect individuals and how one can protect their capital and savings, or even benefit from the changes through various [[investment_opportunities_and_sectors_benefiting_from_the_great_reset | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Key Players and Events

The concept of the Great Reset is spearheaded by Klaus Schwab, founder of the World Economic Forum (WEF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>. The WEF is purportedly a non-profit NGO and includes influential figures such as Chinese President Xi Jinping <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, Vladimir Putin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>, Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>, Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>, and George Soros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The most public aspect of this organization is the annual Davos World Economic Forum, held every January in the Swiss Alps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Access to this exclusive event can cost between $13,000 and $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. The Davos Forum 2021 specifically saw global leaders launch this new great economic reset <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This economic "recipe" is presented as a response to the current global crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, proposing a total transformation of society and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. Klaus Schwab has even published a book detailing his future plans for the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. While presented as beneficial, some of these reforms may not have positive outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

## Pillars of the Great Reset

The reforms proposed by the Great Reset primarily focus on three areas: social, economic, and environmental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. Given the capitalist system, new economic measures are central to these reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

### Increased Taxation

One of the primary proposals is an increase in taxes for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This is mainly due to governments becoming heavily indebted during the recent crisis, requiring more taxes to repay debts issued to support the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Additionally, governments are raising funds to boost sectors recommended by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

This tax increase mechanism appears to be underway in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Janet Yellen, former president of the [[federal_reserves_economic_plans | Federal Reserve]], became the Secretary of the Treasury, wielding significant economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. President Joe Biden, a supporter of the World Economic Forum, has an [[federal_reserves_economic_plans | economic plan]] that includes many of the Great Reset's recommended reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Janet Yellen stated that the recovery plan would prioritize raising taxes on the wealthy, who benefited from the 2017 Republican tax cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. She even suggested imposing taxes on unrealized stock market profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. This measure would discourage stock market investment and negatively affect markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

After Donald Trump's significant tax cuts in 2017, which led to accelerated S&P 500 profits between 2016 and 2018 and a bullish stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>, reversing these cuts could have the opposite effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Some analysts estimate a potential 15-20% drop in stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

### Environmental Focus and Green Energy

The Great Reset proposes reforms related to the environment and carbon emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. The term "zero emissions balance" has become popular, indicating tremendous aid for the renewable or clean energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. New taxes will also be created to discourage highly polluting energies and to fund cleaner energy initiatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.

The Davos 2021 forum agenda is filled with events on renewable energies and carbon emissions, featuring guests like Bill Gates, Vladimir Putin, and the President of India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. The Democratic government of Joe Biden has committed over $2 trillion in aid to the renewable energy sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. This policy has contributed to the strong performance of this sector on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. Conversely, investment in highly polluting energies like oil or coal is discouraged, which has led to poor stock market performance for these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>.

### The Fourth Industrial Revolution and Technology

Another reform proposed by the Great Reset is the "fourth industrial revolution," focusing on promoting new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The Davos forum dedicates an entire day to this topic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. The European Union's official website indicates that major aid, over 140 billion euros, will be allocated to innovation and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. Governments and companies will be compelled to spend this money on new technological projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. This explains why the Nasdaq and technology stocks have been top performers in recent years, benefiting significantly from this revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

### Socially Responsible Investing (ESG)

The Great Reset also seeks to promote investment in socially committed companies, adhering to what is known as Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG) criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. Historically, companies prioritized shareholders, but this new approach aims for all stakeholders to benefit, including social, environmental, and human aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. Companies meeting these criteria have shown exceptional performance in recent years, making it an area attracting significant investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>. S&P 500 companies that meet ESG requirements have significantly outperformed those that do not <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>.

## Controversies and Economic Impacts

A significant point of distrust towards the World Economic Forum and the Great Reset stems from "Event 201," a pandemic simulation held in October 2019, four months before the actual global crisis of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. This simulation, involving government leaders, scientists, and large multinationals, bore immense similarities to the real crisis, fueling many conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:16">[00:15:16]</a>.

The measures proposed by the Great Reset are inherently inflationary because financing large investments necessitates printing new money and increasing government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. In an inflationary environment, gold typically performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Coincidentally, [[ray_dalios_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]], a regular Davos forum member and manager of the world's largest investment fund, holds significant amounts of gold in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities and Strategies

The Great Reset, despite potential negative aspects, also presents specific [[investment_opportunities_and_sectors_benefiting_from_the_great_reset | investment opportunities]] in sectors poised for disproportionate growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

### Renewable Energy

New investment opportunities have emerged in sectors like electric cars (e.g., Tesla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, wind generation (e.g., Gamesa or Siemens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, and solar energy (e.g., Jinko Solar or Canadian Solar) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

For broader exposure, there are various ETFs related to renewable energy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>:
*   **Nasdaq Clean Energy (CELS)**: Listed in the US at around $1,120 per share, it has risen over 300% in less than two years due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **iShares Global Clean Energy (INRG)**: A European version listed in Germany at about 15 euros per share, also showing excellent performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

### Technology Sector

The technology sector, particularly large American tech companies, are expected to be highly beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Companies like Facebook, Google, or Amazon, despite recent gains, are considered to have reasonable valuations given their high profits and future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Their taxes declared abroad also mean they would be less negatively affected by US tax increases than local companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

*   **Qualcomm (QCOM)**: A leading technology company in microchip and processor manufacturing, especially for smartphones (Snapdragon processors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. Qualcomm holds over 140,000 patents worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The Great Reset's agenda promotes 5G technology, positioning Qualcomm favorably for additional growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The company also earns significant royalties from licensing its patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. With expected free cash flow of around $9 billion, its current valuation is approximately 20 times earnings, which is below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. Assuming moderate 10% annual growth and trading at 25 times earnings, its target value could exceed $250, offering interesting potential from its current $160 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   **Equinix (EQIX)**: A Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) that benefits from a special US tax regime: if most profits are paid as dividends to shareholders, the company pays no corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. This means it would not be affected by general tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Equinix specializes in building and renting data centers that house processors for storing and processing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Many clients are major tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. This company will significantly benefit from the "fourth industrial revolution" due to the exponential increase in data processing and internet traffic, as Equinix provides the necessary infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. Its adjusted profits (FFO) have tripled from $700 million in 2014 to $2.1 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>. Though trading at a demanding valuation of around 30 times earnings, this is justified by high business predictability and practically assured growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. With expected growth of at least 15%, its value could reach $1,400 from its current $770, indicating significant potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

### Socially Committed Companies (ESG)

Companies adhering to ESG criteria within the S&P 500 include large and high-quality names such as Visa, UnitedHealth, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. These companies are experiencing significant growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

## Conclusion

Despite new measures imposed by politicians, the world tends to progress and generate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:20">[00:16:20]</a>. One of the best ways to capitalize on and benefit from this economic progress is through long-term investment in stocks and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>.

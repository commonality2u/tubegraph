[[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates]] has made recent headlines for his economic predictions, particularly regarding the current crisis and its potential resolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He has offered an exact date for a potential exit from the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Background on Past Predictions

[[economic_predictions_by_bill_gates | Bill Gates]] has a notable history of making relevant predictions regarding crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Months before a significant scenario occurred, he provided advance notice that such an event was possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Although he did not possess a "magic ball," he warned about how it could unfold and potential solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. His statements and the steps he outlined have largely aligned with reality, including warning about the first company likely to develop the vaccine for the prevailing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>, showcasing the [[impact_of_bill_gates_forecasts_on_vaccine_development | impact of Bill Gates' forecasts on vaccine development]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.

## Current Crisis Outlook

[[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates]] believes that we are entering the "worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. In a CNN interview, he linked this to the surge in new cases, noting a shift from an average of two thousand cases per day to peaks of up to three million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

He attributes this situation to a new variant (presumably Omicron), which accounts for 70% of new infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Despite its high transmissibility, this variant is considered half as severe as the previous Delta variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

A major concern highlighted by [[economic_predictions_by_bill_gates | Bill Gates]] is the lack of vaccination in emerging or very poor countries, which facilitates new mutations that then spread to richer nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. He clarifies that while vaccination does not prevent contracting the virus, it significantly reduces its severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. He emphasizes the necessity of addressing this global vaccination disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Comparison to Historical Pandemics

[[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates']] conviction regarding the crisis's end is partly based on historical parallels, specifically with the Spanish Flu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

> There were several waves with different mutations, and the last one that was the most contagious but the mildest, as it seems to be happening with the new variant, because that was what ended up already of that pandemic or that crisis in that moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

This pattern leads him to believe a similar resolution is possible for the current health crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Predicted Resolution Timeline

If the correct steps are taken, [[economic_predictions_by_bill_gates | Bill Gates]] believes the current crisis could conclude by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This resolution is expected to bring benefits to companies negatively impacted by the crisis, allowing them to return to normality by late 2022 or 2023, which would positively reflect in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Conversely, companies that significantly benefited from the crisis may see their stock prices fall as favorable market conditions for internet and technology companies diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

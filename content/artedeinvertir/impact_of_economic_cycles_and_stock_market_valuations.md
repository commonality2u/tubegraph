Warren Buffett, often called the Oracle of Omaha, is reportedly preparing for a financial crisis, having broken his silence to issue an important warning message to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Historically, Buffett has rarely issued such messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. The previous two times he did, both the [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]] and the economy experienced significant setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

Buffett is currently taking drastic measures, rapidly selling stocks to build a substantial cash cushion to navigate upcoming events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:38">[00:00:38]</a>. This signals a negative short- and medium-term outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Warnings

Over 50 years, Warren Buffett has taken measures similar to the current one only twice: rapidly selling stocks and sending a message of caution to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. On both occasions, the [[stock_market_volatility_and_valuation_analysis | market]] fell over 40%, and the economy suffered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

### First Warning (Beginning of his career)
At the start of his career as an investment fund manager, after 13 successful years with annual returns exceeding 30%, Buffett declared that the economy faced significant challenges and [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | stock market valuations]] were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Despite widespread belief that the [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]] would continue to rise, Buffett accumulated cash, eventually returning all money to his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Shortly after, the [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]] fell 20%, accumulating nearly 50% declines over the next four years, and the economy entered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

### Second Warning (1999)
In 1999, 30 years after his initial warning, Buffett warned of "enormous euphoria" in the [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]], [[analysis_of_stock_market_bubbles_and_high_valuations | unsustainable valuations]], and an economic environment with significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>. Again, optimism was widespread, and the economy had experienced one of its longest cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Six months after his warning, the internet bubble ended, major [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock markets]] plummeted over 45%, and the Nasdaq technology index fell over 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. The US and European economies entered a recession 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

## Current Actions and Outlook

Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, currently holds over $300 billion in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>. This amount could buy 100% ownership of companies like Netflix, Starbucks, McDonald's, or Uber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is the most liquid and cash-rich company on the planet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Buffett has been reducing exposure to the financial and banking sectors, notably selling historic holdings like Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. These sectors, while not highly valued, are highly sensitive to potential economic recessions, confirming Buffett's cautious view <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Sectors most affected by a potential crisis:
> The financial, real estate, technology, and industrial sectors are highlighted as most affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. Buffett has reduced or eliminated positions in these, except for Apple, where he significantly reduced his holding after huge profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. He has also been looking to sell his real estate agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

Conversely, the energy sector is expected to be one of the least affected in a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. Buffett has expanded positions in the energy sector, purchasing shares in Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan and a personal friend of Buffett, shares this cautious outlook, stating that the most likely outcome of the current crisis is an [[impact_of_economic_scenarios_on_asset_performance | economic recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Warren Buffett on current circumstances:
> "Given the current circumstances, I am comfortable increasing my cash and liquidity position. When I look at the alternative of investing in the [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]] with everything that is happening in the world, it is not an attractive option for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>

Buffett's statement subtly addresses two problems:
1.  **Global issues:** Current tariff problems, conflicts between China and the United States, speculation in financial markets, and [[the_impact_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_the_stock_market | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
2.  **[[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | Stock market valuations]]:** The current valuations of most stocks are very high for the risks involved and are not worth it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>. He prefers to keep his money in liquidity, earning 5% while waiting for better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. This is a curious position given his historical focus on stocks for returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Expected Stock Market Performance Based on Valuations

A recent J.P. Morgan study on expected [[impact_of_economic_scenarios_on_asset_performance | stock market performance]] shows that the more expensive the starting point of investment, the lower the future performance over the next 10 years for the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Currently, the expected return for the next 10 years is very low, potentially below 5% or even 0% annually, because the [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | valuation]] is very high, ranging between 19 and 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

> [!QUOTE] Warren Buffett on high valuations:
> In a letter to investors, Buffett stated, "In the coming years, we hope to use this liquidity to buy high-quality companies that will remain part of Berkshire Hathaway forever. However, currently, the prices of businesses with good long-term characteristics are sky-high." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>
Buffett reaffirmed he would make the same decisions (holding cash) unless [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | stock valuations]] fell, even if the return on his liquidity dropped to 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>.

## Advice for Small Investors

When asked what he would do as a small investor with limited money in an environment of high [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | stock market valuations]], Warren Buffett suggested focusing on smaller companies where there's a greater chance of finding a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. He stated, "If I had less than a million dollars today, I would be fully invested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

This implies investing in lesser-known companies where finding a cheap company is more probable, even in an expensive market, leading to long-term benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. While indexing (investing in famous companies like the S&P 500) has yielded strong results and is a valid long-term strategy, studies suggest future performance will be much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. A complementary strategy involves selecting individual investments for greater control and appreciation potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>.

Buffett made his fortune by selecting his own investments in lesser-known companies with greater appreciation potential and attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Four Keys to Successful Investing
1.  **Buy good businesses with growing profits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.
2.  **At attractive [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | valuations]]** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
3.  **With good management** who treat shareholders well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>.
4.  **Who provide dividends, buy back shares, or run the business well** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

To assess whether a business is expensive or cheap, compare its profits with its listed market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>. Buffett is extremely disciplined in his [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | investment valuation]], which reduces [[stock_market_volatility_and_valuation_analysis | risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]] typically trades at an average of 16 times earnings but is currently at 20 times earnings, which is why Buffett believes it is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. His 10 best investments, which generated 80% of his wealth, rarely involved paying more than 15 times earnings when initiating a position, except for Moody's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

Warren Buffett's investment universe has shrunk, allowing him to invest in only about 50 out of over 40,000 listed companies worldwide due to his enormous wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. For a private investor, opportunities remain abundant, especially in lesser-known companies with greater growth potential and attractive [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | valuations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. Large, well-known companies like Nike and Starbucks have likely already had their high-growth cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

Small-cap [[valuation_and_stock_market_trends | valuations]] are currently the most undervalued and attractive segment of the [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes | stock market]], well below their historical average at just 12 times earnings, representing almost a 40% discount compared to larger indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Eurostock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

## Conclusion

Warren Buffett emphasizes that economic crises are inevitable but should be viewed as opportunities for good investments with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>.

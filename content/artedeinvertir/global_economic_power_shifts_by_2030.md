The [[2030 Agenda and its economic implications | 2030 Agenda]], also known as "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world," represents a significant economic and social reform designed to affect everyone globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This plan is currently underway, with its first consequences already becoming apparent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. It is supported by influential figures such as Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, most heads of state, and the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Many experts suggest that the policies proposed in this economic plan could be contributing to the current global economic crisis, including high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. The campaign's motto is strikingly summarized as: "you will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Origins and Key Figures of the Agenda

The [[2030 Agenda and its economic implications | 2030 Agenda]] was designed in 2015 and originated from the Davos Forum (World Economic Forum), which convenes powerful global leaders, businessmen, and economists like Bill Gates and [[Ray Dalios economic predictions for 2025 | Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The Forum serves as a platform to debate economic policies later implemented at a local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Klaus Schwab leads the Davos Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>, and Danish politician Ida Auken is also a key figure behind some of the proposed economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Auken famously stated, summarizing the agenda's economic aspect: "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Predicted Global Economic Shifts by 2030

The World Economic Forum has published a promotional video titled "Eight Predictions for the World in the Year 2030," which outlines significant anticipated changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

### Decline of US Dominance

One striking prediction indicates that "The United States will no longer be the world's leading power and a small number of countries will replace them" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   [[Ray Dalios economic predictions for 2025 | Ray Dalio]] has previously warned of this risk in his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   In this new scenario, the US dollar would cease to be the most important global currency, and the US could face a "terrible decline" due to accumulating debt and rising political populism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.
*   Data from the International Monetary Fund shows the dollar's market share has already dropped from 70% to 60%, being replaced by other currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>.
*   The Chinese yuan and other Asian currencies are noted as rising contenders, reflecting where current economic growth is being generated, a point also highlighted by [[Ray Dalios economic predictions for 2025 | Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>.

### Shift from Ownership to Rental

Another significant prediction for 2030 is: "you will own nothing and you will be happy you will be able to rent anything you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This represents a fundamental shift in consumer behavior from owning goods to renting them long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.
*   This model is proving "tremendously beneficial for a small number of companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   Examples include:
    *   Cars: In the US, 70% of vehicles sold are financed, often through rentals or monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
    *   Phones: Most people rent their iPhones from Apple via monthly fees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
    *   Housing: Most people have mortgages or pay monthly rent for their homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
    *   Entertainment: Movies are accessed via monthly subscriptions like Netflix instead of being bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   Companies like Microsoft and Adobe have already successfully transitioned from perpetual licenses to subscription models, leading to significant profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.
*   This trend is encouraged by political and economic powers, and unlike in the past where such coordinated industry actions might be deemed monopolistic, they are now approved if they align with the [[2030 Agenda and its economic implications | 2030 Agenda]] objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

### Radical Environmental Policies

Predictions numbers five and six from the World Economic Forum highlight the goal of environmental protection. However, the proposed method is described as "totally radical," involving the complete elimination of fossil fuels without clear strategic energy transition planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Measures such as establishing price limits on gas or oil are suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>.
*   This approach is identified as a major cause of the current high inflation crisis, primarily due to soaring fossil fuel prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   A "battle against fossil fuels" coinciding with the [[2030 Agenda and its economic implications | 2030 Agenda]]'s implementation has led to a lack of investment in the sector, causing high energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Investment in oil exploitation and production has reportedly fallen by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
*   Despite these policies, oil and gas companies have seen significant investment and profit growth, exemplified by Warren Buffett's aggressive investments in companies like Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

The **[[2030 Agenda and its economic implications | 2030 Agenda]]** is expected to profoundly modify the way individuals invest and save <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Understanding these predicted shifts can help individuals navigate and potentially benefit from the evolving economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.

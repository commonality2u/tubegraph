Bill Gates, widely recognized as the founder of Microsoft, is also noted as an exceptional investor with a significant portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. His portfolio is valued at over $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> and constitutes roughly half of his total fortune of $110 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. Notably, this portfolio is highly concentrated, with 80-90% of the value held in just six stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Historically, tracking Bill Gates's portfolio since 2019 would have yielded positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. As a major investor, he is required to publicly disclose his portfolio positions periodically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy
A consistent theme across Bill Gates's investments is his focus on market leaders, avoiding second or third-best companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. He seeks businesses with double-digit earnings per share (EPS) growth, even if revenue growth is less than 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a>. He also tends to avoid overpaying for stocks, often investing at or below average historical valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:41">[00:41:41]</a>. His portfolio is concentrated, with a preference for a few strong holdings rather than numerous smaller positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:12">[00:25:12]</a>. All of his top holdings share common characteristics: they are predictable businesses with tailwinds and dominant market positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:56">[00:24:56]</a>. Furthermore, these companies typically offer solid and consistently growing dividend payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>, and many also return capital to shareholders through share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a>.

## Key Portfolio Holdings

### John Deere (Deere & Company - DE)
*   **Portfolio Weight:** 3.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>
*   **Rationale:** Bill Gates is bullish on food production due to potential shortages and global population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. In addition to investing in agricultural equipment companies, he is one of the largest [[bill_gates_investment_in_arable_land | landowners]] in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership:** John Deere is a clear market leader in industrial agricultural machinery, with surveys indicating that 60% of American farmers use their equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. This leadership is attributed to its technological capabilities, quality-price ratio, and reliability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality & Profitability:** While the business is cyclical, dependent on farmer income and raw material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, John Deere has consistently been profitable and cash flow positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. Profit margins from equipment sales have recently risen to 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>, benefiting from the inflation crisis post-Covid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Technological Advancement:** John Deere is a surprising beneficiary of Artificial Intelligence (AI) and technological advancements, with self-driving tractors that can navigate fields via GPS, automatically stop for obstacles, and return to storage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>. This provides a significant competitive advantage over smaller rivals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. The company invests nearly $2 billion annually in R&D to maintain this edge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.
*   **Growth Outlook:** The agricultural equipment sector is estimated to grow at 7% annually, more than double the general economy's 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. As a strong brand, John Deere could grow even faster, potentially offering Bill Gates a double-digit return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** The stock currently trades at 11 times earnings, near its Covid lows, despite strong earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. It is also a "dividend aristocrat," having continuously increased dividends for over 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Caterpillar (CAT)
*   **Portfolio Weight:** 4.3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>
*   **Rationale:** Caterpillar is well-positioned to benefit from a significant investment deficit in infrastructure, public works, and housing construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:29">[00:09:29]</a>. Its main markets—construction, mining, and public works—face strong tailwinds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. US political figures, including Biden and potentially Trump, have expressed intent to modernize US infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership:** Caterpillar is the undisputed leader in construction and mining machinery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Its continued investment in technology is expected to widen its competitive gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality & Performance:** While cyclical, Caterpillar has a strong track record of consistent dividends and share price appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. The company has seen significant revenue growth in recent years (20% in 2021, 16% in 2022) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Profit margins have remained stable around 13-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Shareholder Returns:** Caterpillar is a "dividend king" or "dividend aristocrat," having paid continuously rising dividends for over 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. It also actively engages in share buybacks, indicating management believes the stock is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>.
*   **Oil & Gas Sector:** A significant portion of Caterpillar's machinery is supplied to the oil and gas sector, particularly for well establishment, land preparation, and pipeline construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. Increased investment in oil exploration and production is expected dramatically by 2025-2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:33">[00:16:33]</a>.
*   **Future Growth:** The company anticipates sales reaching $72 billion (from $60 billion) with continued margin expansion due to economies of scale and pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. This could lead to 20-25% profit growth, amplified by share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Caterpillar trades at 13 times earnings, below its five-year average of 18 times and far below its historical highs of 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. This low valuation despite growth makes it attractive.

### Waste Management (WM)
*   **Portfolio Weight:** 14.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>
*   **Rationale:** Waste management, despite its unglamorous nature, is a highly lucrative and predictable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:07">[00:20:07]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership:** Waste Management is the clear market leader in the US waste collection business, an industry controlled by only three or four major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. These private companies often operate more efficiently and cheaply than municipal services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** The business is highly predictable and essential; it demonstrated resilience during the 2007-2011 crisis, not growing but also not declining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:42">[00:21:42]</a>. This makes it a low-volatility stock with good historical results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Growth & Investment:** The US waste collection market is expected to grow at 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. Waste Management is making substantial investments (e.g., $500-1000 million in 2023) in recycling and waste processing, aligning with the green economy trend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. These investments are projected to accelerate growth, with annual increases of 8-9% in revenue and over 12% in EPS by 2025-2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Waste Management currently trades at 25 times earnings, which is its historical average, not considered a "bubble figure" for this type of predictable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>.

### Canadian National Railway (CNR)
*   **Portfolio Weight:** 15.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:27">[00:26:27]</a>
*   **Rationale:** Canadian National Railway is a dominant rail transport company in Canada that recently merged with Kansas City Southern, creating a North American axis connecting Canada's southern region to the Gulf of Mexico for raw material transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>.
*   **Strategic Importance:** Rail transport remains a highly cost-effective means for heavy merchandise that doesn't require immediate delivery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>.
*   **Market Dominance & Stability:** With only three or four major companies controlling almost the entire business, Canadian National Railway, like Warren Buffett's BNSF, enjoys a local monopoly and strong market dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a>. This makes the business non-cyclical, as demand for raw material transportation is predictable and constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance & Shareholder Returns:** The stock has shown impressive long-term growth, multiplying almost 100 times over 25 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a> with very low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:00">[00:30:00]</a>. The company consistently increases its dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a> and engaged in record share buybacks in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:21">[00:32:21]</a>.
*   **Growth Outlook:** Canadian National Railway expects to reach $7 per share in earnings within the next three years (from $7.25) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>, with annual profit growth between 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** The company trades at 20 times earnings, which aligns with its historical five-year average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

### Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)
*   **Portfolio Weight:** 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:33">[00:35:33]</a>
*   **Rationale:** Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett (a close friend of Bill Gates), is an iconic and highly successful investment vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:27">[00:35:27]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Berkshire Hathaway operates through two main business lines:
    1.  **Private Companies:** Acquiring 100% ownership of diverse businesses like Duracell, Geico, and See's Candies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:53">[00:35:53]</a>. This includes BNSF, a major railroad competitor to Canadian National Railway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:26">[00:36:26]</a>.
    2.  **Publicly Traded Stocks:** Buying minority stakes in well-known companies such as Apple, Bank of America, and Moody's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:28">[00:36:28]</a>.
*   **Performance & Volatility:** Berkshire Hathaway has consistently outperformed the S&P 500 across various timeframes with very low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:53">[00:36:53]</a>. Since 1983, the stock has multiplied 500 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.
*   **Key Metric: Book Value:** The most important metric for analyzing Berkshire Hathaway is its book value per share, which has shown incessant growth over two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:41">[00:37:41]</a>. Fluctuations in book value, such as drops during crises, are often less severe than stock price declines, creating opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:13">[00:41:13]</a>.
*   **Valuation & Buybacks:** Warren Buffett has indicated a "correct" multiple for Berkshire Hathaway is 1.6 times book value, while the market typically values it around 1.4 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:14">[00:39:14]</a>. Buffett's share buybacks (e.g., in 2020-2021) are often a strong indicator of undervaluation, leading to good stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>.
*   **Cash Reserves:** Berkshire Hathaway holds over $100 billion in cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:48">[00:41:48]</a>, providing stability and the ability to seize investment opportunities during downturns, such as a potential recession in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:04">[00:42:04]</a>.

### Microsoft (MSFT)
*   **Portfolio Weight:** 31% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:47">[00:42:47]</a>
*   **Rationale:** As the founder, Bill Gates possesses intimate knowledge of Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:17">[00:43:17]</a>. His investment is gigantic, exceeding $50 billion when including personal holdings and those in his trust, representing over 50% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>. He actively bought shares during the 2022 tech downturn when the stock was around $220-230 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>.
*   **Business Segments:** Microsoft has three main lines of business:
    1.  **Hardware:** Products like Xbox and peripherals, which are the most volatile and uncertain segment, though a small percentage of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:01">[00:44:01]</a>.
    2.  **Office 365 Ecosystem:** (e.g., Word, PowerPoint, Excel) This segment has enormous competitive advantages due to its widespread use ("network effect") and successful migration to a subscription-based cloud model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:09">[00:44:09]</a>. It is expected to grow at 10-15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:37">[00:45:37]</a>.
    3.  **Cloud (Microsoft Azure) & Artificial Intelligence (AI):** The "jewel in the crown" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:57">[00:44:57]</a>. Microsoft is a major shareholder in OpenAI (creator of ChatGPT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:09">[00:45:09]</a>. The intelligent cloud segment is the primary source of income for Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:03">[00:47:03]</a> and is expected to grow at 15-20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:35">[00:45:35]</a>.
*   **Historical Performance:** Microsoft has been one of the most profitable investments, multiplying by 4,000 times since its trading debut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:08">[00:46:08]</a>. While it experienced a lateral period from 2000-2012 due to overvaluation (trading at 60 times earnings), it subsequently became undervalued (12 times earnings) before its significant ascent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:14">[00:46:14]</a>.
*   **Recent Performance & Outlook:** In the last quarter, profits grew 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:38">[00:47:38]</a>. Combined with AI excitement, the stock is near all-time highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:44">[00:47:44]</a>. Microsoft expects to continue double-digit growth rates in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:53">[00:48:53]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Currently, Microsoft trades at 30 times earnings, slightly above its five-year average of 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:27">[00:49:27]</a>, driven by excitement around AI and its perception as a safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:36">[00:49:36]</a>.

In a unique moment for stock markets, dubbed "Black Monday" on March 9th, 2020, falls similar to the 2008 crisis were observed, with some media predicting a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. Simultaneously, oil experienced its biggest fall in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">00:00:14</a>. This period presents specific [[sectorspecific_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]] that warrant analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">00:00:22</a>.

## Market Context: Black Monday and Its Catalysts

"Black Monday" saw historic declines in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">00:00:40</a>. Two main catalysts contributed to this situation:

1.  **The "Problem That We All Know"**: This unspecified problem, which YouTube algorithms reportedly dislike being mentioned <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">00:01:04</a>, led to significant market disruptions. The US stock market experienced falls of up to 8%, while the Italian stock market saw declines of up to 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">00:00:57</a>. The circuit breaker mechanism, unused for decades, had to be activated in the US, stopping all stock trading when falls exceeded 7% to allow investors to calm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">00:01:14</a>. This crisis is fundamentally a consumer crisis, with 70% of the economy based on consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">00:01:57</a>. Companies with high debt or fixed costs were particularly impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">00:02:07</a>.
2.  **Oil Price Collapse**: Saudi Arabia's decision to increase oil production, following Russia's refusal to agree to production cuts, caused oil prices to fall by nearly 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">00:00:46</a>. While initially negative for the market due to potential bankruptcies among weaker oil companies and exposure of banks to their debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">00:05:47</a>, cheaper oil ultimately benefits the economy by increasing disposable income for consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">00:06:25</a>. Most Western countries benefit from lower oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">00:06:52</a>.

## General Investment Advice During Crises

> "I don't think anyone knows what the market is going to do what you have to think about is whether you are making an intelligent purchase at current prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">00:08:45</a>

Investors are advised not to panic, as selling at the worst possible moment is detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">00:07:44</a>. It's crucial to review portfolios for companies with high debt or sensitivity to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">00:02:44</a>. Companies with debt maturities in the near future (e.g., three to six months) should be particularly scrutinized, although many have access to liquidity or credit lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">00:02:54</a>. Governments and central banks are also injecting liquidity and offering aid to companies to prevent widespread bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">00:04:30</a>.

Warren Buffett, known for accurate predictions, advises against trying to guess market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">00:08:41</a>. Instead, focus on making intelligent purchases at current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">00:08:50</a>. His strategy in crises is to invest in quality companies directly affected by the problem but possessing strong solvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">00:10:00</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities in Affected Sectors

The following examples highlight companies in heavily impacted [[analysis_of_investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_including_technology_and_transport | transport]] and tourism sectors that could present [[sectorspecific_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]]:

### Delta Airlines (Aviation)
Warren Buffett began accumulating shares of Delta Airlines, one of the companies at the "epicenter of the storm" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">00:09:25</a>. He started buying Delta Airlines shares since the end of February at an average price of $45 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">00:09:41</a>. This choice is notable because Delta is considered to have one of the most solid balance sheets in the airline industry and is well-positioned to weather the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">00:09:50</a>.

### Aena (Airport Management)
Aena is a Spanish company holding a monopoly over the management of all Spanish airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">00:10:44</a>.
*   **Business Model**: It is a highly profitable business with no competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">00:10:50</a>. Airport stocks are historically resilient, with air traffic barely decreasing even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">00:11:03</a>. A significant portion (70%) of Aena's income comes from non-regulated lines of business like renting airport space for shops and restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">00:11:18</a>.
*   **Valuation**: After multiplying from 50 euros to 200 euros over five years, Aena's shares fell to around 100 euros due to the current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">00:11:36</a>. It is currently trading at 10 times its earnings, significantly below its historical valuation of around 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">00:11:44</a>. The Western market's reaction might be an overreaction compared to Shanghai airport's stock price, which barely fell and still trades at 25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">00:11:51</a>.

### Autogrill (Airport & Highway Restaurants)
Autogrill is an Italian company specializing in managing restaurants in airports and along highways, and it is a leading company in this sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">00:12:24</a>.
*   **Impact**: Being listed on the Italian stock exchange and directly tied to the airline sector, Autogrill's shares fell from 10 euros to 5 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">00:12:33</a>.
*   **Resilience & Prospects**: The company has low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">00:12:49</a>. Once the transitory situation passes, air traffic is expected to return, allowing the company to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">00:12:52</a>. Historically, Autogrill maintained sales and profits even in challenging years like 2008 and 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">00:13:20</a>. Under normal conditions, it was expected to generate one euro per share in profits, with shares potentially trading at a minimum of 12 euros, and a future target price of 15 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">00:13:33</a>.

### Amadeus (Flight IT Infrastructure)
Amadeus is a Spanish company that holds a monopoly over the IT infrastructure facilitating flight sales and reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">00:14:05</a>.
*   **Business Model**: It is a predictable, high-quality business with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">00:14:21</a>.
*   **Performance & Valuation**: Since its IPO in 2010 at 12 euros per share, its shares had risen to 70 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">00:14:26</a>. Due to the current situation, they have fallen vertically to just over 40 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">00:14:34</a>. The current P/E ratio is 14 times, which is very attractive considering it normally trades at 20-25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">00:14:41</a>. Its current value could be estimated at over 80 euros per share, with potential to expand above 100 euros in two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">00:14:48</a>.

## Conclusion

Morgan famously stated, "in bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">00:15:18</a>.

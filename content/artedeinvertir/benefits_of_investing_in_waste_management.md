Bill Gates' initial investment in the company was noted in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. The company has shown strong performance, demonstrating Bill Gates' keen investment insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a>.

## Business Overview and Market Position

Waste Management operates in the "glorious work of waste collection," a business that, while not glamorous, has historically been very lucrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>. The sector is now professionalized and is largely controlled by only three or four companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:18">[00:20:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:55">[00:20:55]</a>. Waste Management is the clear market leader with the largest market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>.

The waste collection business is characterized by its predictability and essential nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:25">[00:21:25]</a>, as waste is constantly generated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:38">[00:21:38]</a>. Companies like Waste Management often perform waste collection more efficiently and cheaply than city councils, leading to them gaining market share from public management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.

## Financial Resilience and Growth Prospects

Waste Management has demonstrated significant financial resilience:
*   **Crisis Resistance** The company successfully withstood the 2007-2011 financial crisis, maintaining its revenue without decrease, which is highly valued by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>.
*   **Low Volatility** It is considered a stock with very low volatility, yet it has delivered good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:06">[00:22:06]</a>.
*   **Steady Growth** The waste collection business in the United States is projected to grow by 5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:30">[00:22:30]</a>.
*   **Strategic Investment** The company is making substantial investments (between $500 million and $1 billion in 2023-2024) in the recycling, green economy, and sustainable economy sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:04">[00:23:04]</a>. These long-term investments are expected to yield significant returns, with EBITDA increasing by $600-$800 million per year starting in 2025-2026 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:19">[00:23:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:27">[00:23:27]</a>.
*   **Accelerated Profit Growth** While sales growth has been slower historically, with the tailwind from recycling and waste processing, the company's business plan for the next three years projects annual sales growth of 8-9% and profit growth at an even higher rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:51">[00:23:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:05">[00:24:05]</a>. With share buybacks, earnings per share (EPS) could grow by over 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.

## Shareholder Returns and Valuation

Waste Management is a mature business with a strong dividend component, consistently paying and increasing dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>. The company's predictable nature and dominant market position are attractive to investors like Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:55">[00:24:55]</a>.

Valuation-wise, as a less cyclical company, the market tends to apply higher multiples. It currently trades at 25 times earnings, which is around its average for recent years, sometimes reaching 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:32">[00:25:32]</a>. While it was cheaper in 2019-2020 when Bill Gates initially invested, current figures are not considered "bubble figures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. The S&P 500 typically trades at 19 times earnings, suggesting Waste Management is a better company than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.

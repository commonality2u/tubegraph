This article explores the investment strategies of notable investors, focusing on [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | Michael Burry's significant investments]] in Google and Facebook, and provides an analysis of their potential as [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]]. The discussion highlights the companies' financial performance, operational strengths, and resilience in various market conditions, contrasting them with more speculative assets.

## Michael Burry's Bullish Bets
Noted investor [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | Michael Burry]], known for predicting the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis, has made substantial bullish investments in Google and Facebook shares, despite being bearish on many high-growth technology stocks [00:12:30]. These investments are structured through call options to leverage and potentially multiply profits [00:32:41]. Burry's approach often involves creating "asymmetrical investments" where potential losses are small, but potential gains are substantial [00:06:32]. His portfolio strategy aims to benefit from assets that are expected to rise, complementing his macroeconomic bets [00:05:47].

## Google (Alphabet Inc.)
Google, currently trading at approximately $2,300 (up from $1,100 when previously analyzed in a video) [01:22:45], is considered a strong [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_banks_and_tech_companies | investment opportunity]] due to its robust financial performance and competitive advantages [01:29:43].

### Financial Performance and Operating Leverage
Google's income has significantly increased from $41 billion to $55 billion in the first three months of the year [00:33:51]. A key factor in this growth is its "operating leverage," where sales increase while costs remain relatively stable, leading to a disproportionate rise in profit [00:34:03]. For instance, marketing, advertising, and administrative costs have either remained constant or decreased, allowing profits to skyrocket from $7 billion to $21 billion, and earnings per share from $10 to over $26 per quarter [00:34:10]. The first quarter is historically the weakest for Google, suggesting even stronger performance during consumption-heavy periods like Christmas [00:34:51].

### Market Position and Growth Drivers
Google has capitalized on the shift from traditional media, accelerating its market share gain from television and newspapers, particularly during periods of confinement [00:35:06]. Both Google and YouTube segments have seen approximately 50% growth [00:35:19]. The company's cloud computing business has also grown by around 50% [00:35:40]. Google is described as the strongest company in the online advertising sector, expected to continue growing at 10-15 times current rates [00:35:45]. Investors like Charlie Munger and [[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | Warren Buffett]] view Google as having probably the greatest competitive advantage worldwide [00:35:51].

### Valuation
Despite its strong performance, Google is not considered overvalued, trading at a "cheap multiple" compared to some other tech companies [00:35:57].
*   **Estimated Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Expected to earn $100 per share this year, and between $120 and $140 per share by 2023 [00:37:26].
*   **Target Price:** Based on reasonable valuation multiples (25-30 times earnings), Google could reach a target price of $3,500 to $4,500 per share within two and a half years [00:37:48].
*   **Inflation Impact:** As a company that is not overvalued, Google is less susceptible to rising interest rates due to inflation. It can raise ad prices to offset increased employee wages [00:43:09].

## Facebook (Meta Platforms, Inc.)
Facebook also presents a compelling [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment opportunity]] given its spectacular results [00:36:07].

### Financial Performance and Operating Leverage
Facebook's earnings per share have nearly doubled, from $1.70 to $3.30 [00:36:09]. Similar to Google, this growth is attributed to costs increasing significantly less than income; costs rose by 25% while income increased by 46% [00:36:18]. The company's ability to monetize users has also improved, with average earnings per user rising from $7 to $9 [00:36:40]. This indicates increased pricing power and customer acquisition, trends expected to continue [00:37:09].

### Valuation
*   **Estimated Earnings Per Share (EPS):** Expected to earn around $13-15 per share this year, possibly increasing to $18-22 by 2023 [00:38:39].
*   **Target Price:** With valuation multiples of 25-30 times earnings, Facebook could be valued in the range of $500 to $700 per share [00:39:01].

## Investment Principles and Market Caution
The speaker emphasizes that while companies like Google and Facebook offer good [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment opportunities]] with reasonable valuations and competitive advantages [00:43:01], investors should proceed with caution and make informed decisions [00:43:18]. This means understanding risks, evaluating company debt, and recognizing that not all assets perform similarly during periods of inflation [00:43:20].

In contrast to these established companies, some market segments are characterized by "euphoria" and speculative behavior [00:43:44]. These include "meme stocks" like GameStop, certain software companies in the cloud, disruptive technology companies, and SPACs [00:43:47]. The speaker warns against being a "tourist" in the stock market, advising against investing based on hype or unrealistic promises [00:44:34].

Cryptocurrencies are also highlighted as highly speculative assets, likened to internet stocks in the year 2000 [00:45:47]. While underlying technologies like blockchain may be revolutionary, specific applications like Bitcoin are subject to extreme volatility and lack the regulatory oversight found in traditional markets [00:46:00]. The speaker notes that Michael Burry is neither bullish nor bearish on Bitcoin but warns about the inherent leverage and the potential for government regulation [00:47:13].

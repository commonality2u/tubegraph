The "Great Economic Reset" movement, spearheaded by the World Economic Forum and its founder Klaus Schwab, proposes a new economic scenario that is expected to affect everyone globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This initiative has the support of influential figures including heads of government and prominent businessmen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. The Forum's annual event in Davos, Switzerland, serves as a platform for world leaders to launch these economic reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. While presented as beneficial, some of the proposed reforms, particularly those related to tax increases, may have negative implications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

## Proposed Tax Increases

One of the primary proposals of the "Great Economic Reset" is a significant increase in taxes for both individuals and companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This measure is driven by two main factors:
1.  **Government Indebtedness** Governments have accumulated substantial debt following recent crises and need to collect more taxes to repay these debts, which were incurred to support the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
2.  **Sectoral Boosting** Increased tax revenue is also intended to boost sectors recommended by the World Economic Forum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.

This tax increase mechanism appears to be underway in the United States, a trend often replicated globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. Janet Yellen, former Federal Reserve president and now Secretary of the Treasury, holds significant economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The economic plan of newly elected U.S. President Joe Biden, a supporter of the World Economic Forum, incorporates many of these recommended reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

In a recent interview, Janet Yellen stated:
> "The recovery plan will prioritize raising taxes on the wealthy since both benefited from the Republican tax cuts of 2017 and now they must pay their share." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>

Yellen further proposed taxing "unrealized profits" in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This means if a stock is bought for $10 and is worth $14 at year-end, taxes would be paid on the $4 profit even if the shares haven't been sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. This proposal could [[impact_of_economic_policies_on_investment | totally discourage investment]] in the stock market and have a negative effect on markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>.

## Historical Context and Market Impact

In 2017, Donald Trump enacted significant tax cuts in the U.S., a trend followed by many other countries creating more favorable tax environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The profits of the S&P 500 notably accelerated between 2016 and 2018 due to these tax cuts, contributing to a bullish stock market during those years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

If these tax cuts are reversed, the effect on stock markets could be the opposite <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Some analysts estimate a potential drop of 15% to 20% in stock markets, particularly the American stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. This illustrates the direct [[impact_of_macroeconomic_trends_on_investment_decisions | impact of economic policies on investment decisions]].

## Investment Strategies in a Changing Tax Landscape

Investors may wonder if certain investments will be unaffected by theoretical tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

### Companies with International Tax Declarations
Large American technology companies like Facebook, Google, or Amazon, which declare a significant portion of their taxes abroad, might not be as negatively affected by a potential tax increase in the U.S. compared to more locally focused companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
Companies structured as REITs, such as Equinix (EQIX), operate under a special U.S. tax regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. If they distribute the majority of their profits as dividends to shareholders, they are exempt from corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>. This implies that even with a general tax increase on traditional companies, REITs would remain unaffected, as their tax regime is not expected to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. Equinix specializes in building and renting data centers, benefiting from the "fourth industrial revolution" and the exponential increase in data processing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

## Broader Economic Impacts and Investment Opportunities

Beyond direct tax reforms, the financing of large investments promoted by the "Great Economic Reset" often involves printing new money and increased government debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>. This can lead to an [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflationary environment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. In such an environment, gold is historically an asset that performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>. Ray Dalio, a prominent global investor and regular attendee of the Davos Forum, has large amounts of money invested in gold in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>. This highlights a potential strategy to protect capital against the broader [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | economic risks]] associated with these reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

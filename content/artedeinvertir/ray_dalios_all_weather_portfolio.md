The [[all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] is an investment method designed by [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]], one of the world's most successful investors and the largest investment fund manager globally [00:00:17]. This system has consistently yielded positive returns in the stock market when used for at least 17 months, providing an average annual return of 7% [00:00:03]. Notably, it performs best during stock market downturns [00:00:11]. In Spanish, the portfolio translates to "the four seasons portfolio" [00:00:29].

## Creator: [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]]

[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] is considered an outsider in financial markets due to his numerous innovations in the stock market [00:01:03]. He began managing just $10,000 from his apartment over 45 years ago [00:01:09]. His investment fund, Bridgewater, now manages over $130 billion, making it the largest in the world [00:01:13]. The [[all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] is one of his key innovations in financial markets [00:01:19].

Initially, [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] used this system privately for himself and his clients [00:01:26]. Its consistent and low-risk results led to a significant influx of capital, enabling his fund to grow to its current size [00:01:30]. It is rumored that investing in his fund requires a minimum sum exceeding $100 million [00:01:44]. Recently, [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] decided to make this system public, aiming to contribute to society and the investment community [00:01:51].

## Performance and Resilience

The results of the [[all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] speak for themselves [00:02:08]. Over the past 30 years, it has only incurred losses in four years [00:02:10], with the largest annual loss being just 3% [00:02:13]. For the remaining years, it has provided an average annual return of over 7% [00:02:17], which means an investor could, on average, double their assets every 10 years [00:02:22]. This strategy primarily requires buying and holding assets with a simple annual rebalancing [00:02:27].

The portfolio demonstrates high resistance, especially during volatile stock market periods [00:03:24]. Its ability to perform well during stock market crises significantly reduces volatility, which is a major attraction for investors [00:03:29].

## Underlying Philosophy: Economic Seasons

Initially, [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] attempted to predict economic movements to inform investment decisions but found this approach unsuccessful due to the multitude of correlated economic variables [00:05:23]. He simplified the problem by identifying the two main variables affecting stock market behavior: inflation and economic growth [00:06:17]. These variables can each exist in two states: high or low [00:06:28].

This creates four "economic seasons" or scenarios:
1.  High economic growth
2.  Low economic growth
3.  Accelerating inflation
4.  Downward inflation

The [[all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] is designed to perform well in each of these four economic scenarios [00:06:37]. [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] likens the economy to the weather: "we know it's going to rain but we don't know the exact time, we know that it will snow in winter but we don't know the exact day" [00:06:59]. Just as homes are built to withstand various weather phenomena, an investment portfolio should be built to withstand any economic scenario [00:07:07].

## Essential Assets and Allocation

[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] recommends working with four main asset classes: shares (stocks), bonds, commodities, and gold [00:07:24].

### Asset Behavior in Economic Scenarios

*   **High Economic Growth**:
    *   Stocks perform well due to increased corporate profits [00:07:33].
    *   Commodities increase in price due to rising demand [00:07:49].
    *   *Example:* In 2019, large-cap American stocks rose over 30%, and commodities like gold rose over 10% [00:08:00].
*   **Low Economic Growth**:
    *   Stocks and commodities generally perform poorly [00:08:19].
    *   Bonds perform well as investors seek refuge in safe, conservative investments [00:08:22].
    *   *Example:* In 2020, 20-year American government bonds appreciated more than 20% [00:08:33].
*   **Accelerating Inflation**:
    *   Raw materials (commodities) and gold are the "star assets" [00:08:57].
    *   Stocks do moderately well [00:08:59].
    *   Bonds perform poorly [00:09:02].
*   **Downward Inflation**:
    *   Bonds perform well [00:09:24].
    *   Stocks behave satisfactorily [00:09:27].
    *   Raw materials and gold do not perform as well [00:09:31].

The philosophy of the [[all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] is to have assets that perform well in certain economic seasons, while others simply maintain their value or suffer minimal losses, ensuring satisfactory performance in any economic scenario [00:09:04].

## Replicating the Portfolio for Small Investors

[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] provides recommendations for asset weighting within the portfolio, which can be replicated by small investors using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) [00:09:40].

### Recommended Asset Weights and ETFs

1.  **Large-Cap American Stocks (30% weighting)** [00:09:52]
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF tracking the Standard & Poor's 500 [00:09:54].
    *   Example: SPY ETF (ticker ESP) [00:10:01].
2.  **Long-Term American Bonds (40% weighting)** [00:10:21]
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF like iShares Treasury Bonds at 20 years [00:10:29].
    *   Example: TLT ETF (ticker TLT) [00:10:32].
3.  **Medium-Term American Bonds (15% weighting)** [00:10:39]
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF like iShares Treasury Pong at 3-7 years [00:10:47].
    *   Example: IEI ETF (ticker IEI) [00:10:52].
    *   ETFs offer a practical way for small investors to access the bond market, which typically requires higher capital for direct bond issues [00:10:59].
4.  **Commodities (7.5% weighting)** [00:11:21]
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF like iShares Commodity Index [00:11:27].
    *   Example: DBC ETF (ticker DBC) [00:11:32].
    *   This ETF invests in a variety of raw materials, including oil (almost 40%), aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle [00:11:46].
5.  **Gold (7.5% weighting)** [00:11:55]
    *   Can be easily replicated through the purchase of the largest gold ETF in the world [00:11:59].
    *   Example: SPDR Gold Shares ETF (ticker GLD) [00:12:03].
    *   This ETF holds approximately $50 billion in gold, with 45 tons deposited in the Bank of England [00:12:14].

## Portfolio Rebalancing

[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] stresses the importance of rebalancing the portfolio every 12 months [00:12:51]. This ensures that the assets return to their original recommended weightings within the [[all_weather_investment_strategy | All Weather Portfolio]] strategy [00:12:54]. Having the necessary psychological discipline to adhere to the established plan is crucial for investors [00:02:44].

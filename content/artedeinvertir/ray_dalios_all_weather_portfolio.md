The All Weather Portfolio is an investment method created by [[Ray Dalios All Weather investment strategy | Ray Dalio]], one of the world's largest investment fund managers and most successful investors [00:00:17]. This system was developed to provide positive returns consistently in the stock market [00:00:03], with an average annual return of 7% [00:00:09], and performs best when the stock market falls [00:00:12].

## Background and Public Release
[[Ray Dalios All Weather investment strategy | Ray Dalio]] began managing just ten thousand dollars over 45 years ago [00:01:07]. His investment fund is now the largest globally, managing over $130 billion [00:01:13]. The All Weather Portfolio was a key innovation he introduced [00:01:19]. Initially used privately for himself and his clients, its tremendous success, predictable results, and very low risk led to a significant influx of capital [00:01:30]. It is rumored that to invest in [[Ray Dalios All Weather investment strategy | Ray Dalio]]'s fund, one needs a sum greater than $100 million [00:01:46].

Recently, as one of the richest people in the world, [[Ray Dalios All Weather investment strategy | Ray Dalio]] decided to make this system public to contribute to society and the investment community [00:01:51].

## Performance and Resilience
The results of this investment system are impressive [00:02:08]:
*   Over the last 30 years, it has produced losses in only four years [00:02:10].
*   The maximum annual loss was only 3% [00:02:14].
*   It has provided an average annual return of over 7% [00:02:17], meaning an investor could double their assets every 10 years [00:02:23].
*   The system requires minimal effort, mainly "buying and holding" recommended assets and an annual rebalancing [00:02:27].

### Performance During Market Crises
The All Weather Portfolio demonstrates high resistance, especially during volatile stock market periods [00:03:24].
*   **2008 Financial Crisis:** The system experienced temporary losses of 12% between July 2008 and February 2009 [00:04:05]. In contrast, the American stock market fell 60% in the same period [00:04:16]. The All Weather Portfolio recovered its losses in less than seven months [00:04:23], while the American stock market took four years to return to pre-crisis levels [00:04:30].
*   **2020 Crisis:** The maximum fall for this investment method in March 2020 was 2.3% [00:04:41], while the American stock market fell 30% [00:04:48]. All losses were recovered in just one month [00:04:51].

## Underlying Philosophy: The Four Economic Seasons
[[Ray Dalios market predictions | Ray Dalio]] initially tried to predict economic behavior to make investment decisions, but like many investors, he failed due to the complexity and correlation of multiple economic variables [00:05:23]. He then sought a simpler, more elegant solution [00:05:50].

He concluded that the two main variables affecting the stock market's behavior are inflation and economic growth [00:06:17]. Each of these can be in two states (high or low), leading to four possible "economic seasons" [00:06:28]:
1.  High inflation
2.  Low inflation
3.  High economic growth
4.  Low economic growth

The portfolio is designed to perform well in each of these scenarios [00:06:41]. [[Ray Dalios economic predictions | Ray Dalio]] compares the economy to weather, stating that just as houses are built to withstand all weather conditions, an investment portfolio should be built to withstand all economic scenarios [00:06:59].

## Recommended Asset Allocation
[[Ray Dalios All Weather investment strategy | Ray Dalio]] recommends working with four main asset classes: stocks, bonds, commodities, and gold [00:07:24]. The portfolio is balanced so that assets perform well in different economic seasons, offsetting potential losses from others [00:09:06].

### Asset Performance in Economic Scenarios:
*   **High Economic Growth:** Stocks perform well due to increased corporate profits, and commodities also increase in price due to higher demand [00:07:33]. (Example: 2019, large-cap American stocks rose over 30%, gold rose over 10% [00:08:00]).
*   **Low Economic Growth:** Bonds perform very well as investors seek refuge in safe, conservative investments [00:08:12]. Stocks and commodities typically do poorly [00:08:21]. (Example: 2020, 20-year American government bonds appreciated over 20% [00:08:33]).
*   **Accelerating Inflation:** Raw materials and gold are the "star assets" [00:08:52]. Stocks do moderately well, but inflation is detrimental to bonds [00:08:59].
*   **Downward Inflation:** Bonds perform well, and stocks behave satisfactorily [00:09:23]. Raw materials and gold may not perform as well [00:09:31].

### Asset Weighting for Small Investors (Original Strategy)
[[Recommended asset allocation by Ray Dalio | Ray Dalio]]'s recommendations for a small investor to replicate the All Weather Portfolio using ETFs:

*   **30% Large-cap American stocks:** Replicated by purchasing an ETF of the S&P 500 (ticker: SPY) [00:09:52].
*   **40% Long-term American bonds:** Replicated by purchasing an ETF like iShares Treasury Bonds at 20 years (ticker: TLT) [00:10:22].
*   **15% Medium-term American bonds:** Replicated by purchasing an ETF like iShares Treasury Pong at 37 years (ticker: NAV and IU) [00:10:41]. This allows access to the bond market, which typically requires higher capital [00:11:01].
*   **7.5% Commodities:** Replicated by purchasing an ETF like iShares Commodity Index (ticker: SG) [00:11:21]. This ETF invests in various raw materials, including oil (almost 40%), aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle [00:11:46].
*   **7.5% Gold:** Easily recreated through the purchase of the largest gold ETF in the world, SPDR Gold Shares (ticker: GL) [00:11:57]. This ETF holds over $50 billion in gold, with 45 tons deposited in the Bank of England [00:12:14].

The portfolio should be rebalanced every 12 months to ensure assets return to their original recommended weight [00:12:51].

## [[Changes in Ray Dalios investment approach | Recent Changes to Ray Dalio's Investment Approach]]
While [[Ray Dalios All Weather investment strategy | Ray Dalio]] continues to use his All Weather strategy for his investment funds, he is applying certain changes [00:13:00]. His firm, Bridgewater, makes its main positions public, allowing small investors to see these adjustments [00:13:16].

Recent observations of his portfolio show three main changes [00:14:45]:
1.  **Reduced Weight in Bonds:** He has slightly reduced the allocation to fixed income [00:14:50].
2.  **Increased Weight in Gold:** His gold allocation is now greater than 15%, double his original recommendation [00:14:38].
3.  **Increased Weight in International Stocks:** He is increasing investment in stocks from international countries [00:14:56], including ETFs for Indian stocks (ticker: XE and NBA) [00:14:02], and ETFs representing large-cap stocks from emerging countries like Brazil or Korea [00:14:15].

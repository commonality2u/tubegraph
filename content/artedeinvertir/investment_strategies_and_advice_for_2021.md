## Market Outlook and Concerns for 2021
The year 2020 was difficult, and by late 2020, many investors were concerned about a potential new crisis in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. A new variant of a current global problem emerged, appearing to transmit at a greater speed, which caused panic among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This led to immediate reactions such as flight cancellations, border closures, and new containment measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Stocks most affected by this situation included airlines, hotels, and catering companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Uncertainty surrounding the effectiveness of existing remedies against this new variant is high, and uncertainty is generally unfavorable for the economy or the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Further complicating the situation, new economic stimulus measures approved in the U.S. were much lower than initially expected, around $900 billion, while the market anticipated double that amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. The Federal Reserve and these stimulus measures were key to the recovery observed in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Key Voices in Investing

### Warren Buffett
Famous investor Warren Buffett urged the American government to increase stimulus measures to avoid economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>. He emphasized the critical importance of providing liquidity to both families and corporations during times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. In a CNBC interview, Buffett stated:
> Congress is in the process of ruining the dreams of thousands of people. Congress needs to act now. We need another injection of money to complete the job. Congress is currently debating, and I hope they extend the PPP program on a large scale to allow people to see the light at the end of the tunnel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller
[[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | Stanley Druckenmiller]], an investor with one of the best [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investment strategies and philosophies]] and track records, expressed concern about current market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He noted the "absolute euphoria" in the market, drawing a parallel that "after the party comes the hangover" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He stated that while short-term market movements are unpredictable, the next three to five years are expected to be "very, very complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Bull markets often conclude when euphoria becomes widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

### Joel Greenblatt
Investor Joel Greenblatt also warned of significant market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. Greenblatt, known for generating annual returns of over 30% for more than 30 years and navigating various financial crises, manages over $2 billion in funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He highlighted a chilling fact: if one had bought every company that lost money in 2019 and had a market capitalization greater than a billion dollars in 2020, they would have earned an impressive 65% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. This indicates that in times of euphoria, basic [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investment principles]] regarding profits are forgotten, leading to situations where companies losing more money show better stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

## Market Euphoria Indicators

### Options Trading Volume
One of the biggest signs of current market euphoria is that, for the first time, the traded volume of options has exceeded that of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Options are leveraged [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment instruments]] involving debt, meaning their value rises much faster when the stock market goes up, but can also fall much more drastically, potentially losing all value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In times of greed or euphoria, they are preferred by speculators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. Goldman Sachs data shows that traded options volume reached record levels, up to $400 billion, over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Loss-Making Companies Outperforming
In 2020, investing in companies that did not generate profits was a winning strategy, which is atypical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Normally, consistently investing in loss-making companies leads to negative or significantly lower returns than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, not all companies with business-level losses are bad investments, as they may eventually become profitable, like Amazon or Netflix did <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Valuing High-Growth Companies with Losses
A three-step method can be applied to value high-growth companies that are currently producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>:

1.  **Estimate Future Sales**: Project sales three to five years out, assuming a growth rate lower than the current rate, as growth typically slows with scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
2.  **Determine Future Profit Margins**: Assess what profit margins the company could achieve at maturity by looking at established companies in the same sector (e.g., Toyota/Volkswagen for auto, Microsoft/Google for tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This provides a future profit figure and earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier**: Use a profit multiplier based on the industry. A good industry with continued growth (e.g., technology) might warrant 30 to 40 times earnings, while a more cyclical industry (e.g., automotive) might be 15 to 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

This method is simplified, and the range of possibilities for future profit margins and growth is wide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. Strong conviction in a company's long-term high growth could lead to a higher intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Examples of High-Growth Stocks

*   **Nio (NIO)**: Trading at $48 per share, Nio is considered the "Chinese version of Tesla" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It multiplied by over 12 times in 2020 despite having losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Based on estimated future sales of $47-50 billion in two years, and applying a 6% net profit margin (similar to Volkswagen/Toyota) and a 15-20x earnings multiple, its intrinsic valuation could be around $30-$40 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. If Nio reaches $100 billion in sales, it could potentially reach $80 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.
*   **Tesla (TSLA)**: Trading at $680 per share, Tesla's stock multiplied by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. While it had losses in 2019, it began generating profits in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 index boosted shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. Investor Michael Burry (from "The Big Short") stated he was investing against Tesla due to its high valuation, noting its $600+ billion market capitalization exceeds other traditional automakers, despite Tesla generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Bloomberg comparisons show electric vehicle companies are assigned a value of over $1 million per vehicle produced, while traditional manufacturers like Volkswagen ($10,000), Toyota ($25,000), or BMW ($26,000) are significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Palantir Technologies (PLTR)**: Listed at $10 and trading at $30 per share after tripling in three months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>. Palantir is a high-growth technology company with unique data analysis technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. It is currently producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Expected to invoice $1.4 billion in 2021 and growing at 40% annually, it could generate $7.5 billion in sales in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:48">[00:14:48]</a>. With technology sector profit margins (e.g., Microsoft, Oracle, Google) of 20-25%, Palantir could achieve $1.8 billion in profits, leading to $1 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. Applying a 30x earnings multiplier for technology, its fair value could be around $30 per share, indicating the current price already incorporates much of its future benefit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Alibaba (BABA)**: Trading at $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Alibaba's financial valuation is attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings, with an intrinsic value potentially double its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. However, recent events, including a Chinese government investigation for alleged monopolistic practices, pose a risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:46">[00:16:46]</a>. In jurisdictions with fewer investor rights, such government actions can significantly impact stock market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. The short-to-medium term financial economic factor is less relevant than monitoring the evolution of the situation and the company's cooperation with government guidelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Protecting Investments in 2021: Practical Advice
The key in uncertain situations is to invest with common sense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Investing against the market or waiting 100% in cash are not good ideas, as inflation erodes capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

1.  **Maintain Liquidity**: Have 10-30% liquidity in your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:25">[00:18:25]</a>. Statistically, the market corrects at least 10% every year, providing opportunities to capitalize on with cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
2.  **Invest with Conviction**: Only invest in companies where you have high conviction and have conducted in-depth analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Even in euphoric or expensive markets, good [[investment_strategies_and_advice | investment opportunities]] can always be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
3.  **Follow Major Investors**: Observe how major investors position their portfolios in the face of new risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>.

## Portfolios of Major Investors
*   [[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | Stanley Druckenmiller]]'s main investments include Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft, characterized by high growth and high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
*   Michael Burry's main investments focus on Google, Pfizer, and the pharmaceutical company Aceto <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

Ray Dalio, one of the world's largest investment fund managers and an exceptionally successful investor, is often likened to "the Steve Jobs of the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>. He currently manages the largest investment fund globally, boasting over $130 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. This fund's size exceeds the economies of countries like Ecuador, Guatemala, or the Dominican Republic, whose GDPs are less than $100 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Dalio began with humble origins, managing only ten thousand dollars from his small New York apartment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Today, his personal fortune is estimated at over $18 billion, and he has generated more than $56 billion for his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

A key innovation Dalio introduced was his "All Weather" portfolio management system, also known as "the four seasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This system prioritizes predictable returns with low volatility over the highest possible returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It has historically provided an average annual return of 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. In years of loss, such as 2008, losses were only 3%, while the general market fell by up to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio's Prediction]] of a Lost Decade

In a recent interview, [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio stated]] that the stock market and equities could experience a "lost decade" characterized by low returns and high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He further elaborated on this [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | prediction]] in recent statements:

> The market may be on the verge of a lost decade since globalization has reached maximums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Reasons Behind the Prediction

Dalio attributes this [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | forecast]] to several factors:

*   **De-Globalization:** Globalization has been a primary driver of profitability in the developed world over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. However, due to conflicts like that between the US and China, multinational corporations are shifting supply chains back to their home countries, prioritizing security over cost optimization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Examples include Intel and TSMC, which have announced new factories in the US despite higher manufacturing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>.
*   **Shrinking Profit Margins:** One of [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio's main concerns]] revolves around the profit margins currently enjoyed by companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. These margins have expanded from 5% to 10% over the last 30 years due to cost optimization enabled by globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The evolution of earnings per share is the main factor determining a stock's future performance, and profit margins are crucial to this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Increased Debt Post-Crisis:** [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio also stated]] that even if corporate profits recover after a crisis, many companies will emerge with lower profit margins and higher debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:18">[00:04:18]</a>. He echoes Warren Buffett's reasoning for selling airline investments, where companies incurred significant debt to avoid bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>. Future profits will be diverted to debt repayment and interest, rather than business growth or shareholder rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Personal Opinion
> The speaker advises taking statements from large investors like Ray Dalio with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. While their large investments mean general market behavior significantly impacts their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>, small investors have the advantage of being able to select specific companies with better prospects or risk/reward ratios, rather than investing in the market generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

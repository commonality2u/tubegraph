The All Weather Portfolio, created by Ray Dalio, the world's largest investment fund manager and one of the most successful investors, is an [[investment_strategies_for_various_market_scenarios | investment method]] designed to provide positive returns across various economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This system has historically delivered an average annual return of over 7% and performs best when the stock market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Ray Dalio: The Outsider of Financial Markets

Ray Dalio is regarded as an "outsider" in financial markets due to his numerous innovations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Starting with just $10,000 from his apartment over 45 years ago, his investment fund now manages over $130 billion, making it the largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. The All Weather Portfolio, also known as "the four seasons portfolio" in Spanish, was initially used privately for his clients and himself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Its tremendous success, providing predictable results with very low risk, led to significant capital inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. Due to his success and desire to contribute to society, Dalio recently made this system public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Adapting to Economic Seasons

Dalio's approach to the markets simplified the complex challenge of predicting the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. He realized that while many economic indicators exist, they often depend on random factors like political decisions or central bank actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. He concluded that the two main variables affecting stock market behavior are **inflation** and **economic growth** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. These variables can each be in two states: high or low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. This leads to four distinct "economic seasons" or scenarios, for which the All Weather Portfolio is designed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Dalio likens the economy to the weather: we know it will rain or snow, but not the exact time or day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Just as houses are built to withstand various weather phenomena, an investor's portfolio should be built to withstand any economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Performance Across Economic Scenarios

The All Weather Portfolio's results are impressive: over 30 years, it only produced losses in four years, with the maximum loss being just 3% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. Its average annual return exceeded 7%, meaning an investor could typically double their assets every 10 years with minimal effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This [[investment_strategies_for_various_market_scenarios | investment method]] drastically reduces [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | volatility]], making it particularly attractive during uncertain economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Historical Resilience

*   **2008 Financial Crisis**:
    *   All Weather Portfolio: Temporary losses of 12% (July 2008 - February 2009) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. Recovered losses in less than seven months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
    *   American Stock Market: Fell by 60% in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Took four years (until 2012) to return to pre-crisis levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.
*   **2020 Crisis**:
    *   All Weather Portfolio: Maximum fall of 2.3% in March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. Recovered all losses in just one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
    *   American Stock Market: Fell 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

These examples highlight the high resilience of this [[investing_strategies_for_economic_downturns | investment system]] during crises and [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | market volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Asset Classes and Their Behavior in Each Season

Ray Dalio recommends working with four main asset classes: stocks, bonds, commodities, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

1.  **High Economic Growth / Falling Inflation**:
    *   **Stocks**: Perform well as corporate profits increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   **Commodities**: Increase in price due to increased demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   Example: In 2019, large-cap American stocks rose over 30% and commodities like gold rose over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

2.  **Low Economic Growth / Falling Inflation**:
    *   **Bonds**: Perform very well, serving as a safe and conservative refuge for investors during difficult market times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **Stocks and Commodities**: Tend to perform poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
    *   Example: In 2020 (fitting this scenario), 20-year American government bonds appreciated over 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

3.  **Accelerating Inflation / High Growth**:
    *   **Commodities and Gold**: Are the "star assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
    *   **Stocks**: Do moderately well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
    *   **Bonds**: Inflation is detrimental to bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

4.  **Downward Inflation / Low Growth**:
    *   **Bonds**: Perform quite well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
    *   **Stocks**: Behave satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
    *   **Commodities and Gold**: Do not perform as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

The philosophy is to hold assets that perform well in specific economic seasons, while others simply maintain their value or suffer minimal losses, ensuring satisfactory performance in any scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>. This aligns with [[investment_strategies_in_changing_economic_conditions | investment strategies in changing economic conditions]] and [[economic_risks_and_investment_strategies | economic risks and investment strategies]].

## Replicating the All Weather Portfolio for Small Investors

Ray Dalio originally recommended the following weightings for his portfolio, which can be replicated by small investors using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>:

1.  **Large-Cap American Stocks (30% weighting)**:
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF of the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
    *   Example ETF: SPY (ticker), priced at $317 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Buying this ETF is like investing in all 500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>.

2.  **Long-Term American Bonds (40% weighting)**:
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an iShares Treasury Bonds at 20 years ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.
    *   Example ETF: TLT (ticker), priced at $160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

3.  **Medium-Term American Bonds (15% weighting)**:
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an iShares Treasury Bonds at 3-7 years ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>.
    *   Example ETF: IEI (ticker), priced at $133 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.
    *   This provides small investors access to the bond market, which typically requires higher capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

4.  **Commodities (7.5% weighting)**:
    *   Can be replicated by purchasing an iShares Commodity Index ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
    *   Example ETF: GSG (ticker), priced at $10.70 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>.
    *   This ETF invests in various raw materials, including oil (almost 40%), aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

5.  **Gold (7.5% weighting)**:
    *   Can be easily recreated through the largest gold ETF in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.
    *   Example ETF: GLD (ticker), priced at $169 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:03">[00:12:03]</a>. This ETF owns $50 billion in gold, with 45 tons deposited in the Bank of England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

### Rebalancing

A crucial step is to rebalance the portfolio every 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This ensures that assets return to their original recommended weightings within the four seasons strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Current Portfolio Adjustments

While Ray Dalio continues to use his All Weather strategy, he has recently made certain changes to his investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. His current publicly accessible portfolio through Bridgewater, his asset management firm, shows these adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>:

*   **Stocks**:
    *   Has 18% in large company stocks through SPY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
    *   An additional 6% in large-cap stocks through IVV (similar to S&P 500), totaling 24% in U.S. large-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
    *   Starting to invest in international stocks via ETFs from countries like India (ticker: INDA), Brazil, or Korea, and emerging countries (over 6% of portfolio) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

*   **Gold**:
    *   Holds GLD ETF with a weight greater than 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.
    *   Has another gold ETF weighted at 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
    *   Total gold weighting is over 15%, double his original recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:38">[00:14:38]</a>.

### Key Changes Identified:

1.  Slightly reduced the weight in bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
2.  Increased the weight in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
3.  Increased the weight in international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

Warren Buffett has warned that the next crisis is inevitable and has provided tips on how to adapt to the current situation of inflation and other risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He emphasizes that inflation affects everyone, as money loses value if not invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. This article explores key considerations for [[investment strategies during inflation | investing]] by analyzing company financials in an inflationary environment, drawing insights from Warren Buffett's advice and recent actions.

## Understanding Inflation's Impact

Warren Buffett noted that "substantial price increases" are occurring and being accepted by the world, leading to an "overheated" economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He warned that inflation is, and will continue to be, higher than people anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A second wave of inflation is expected in 2023 when wages rise, as they are updated with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

The easiest solution to this problem, according to Buffett, is the devaluation of the dollar or euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Holding dollars or euros, investments in liquidity, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits are considered "very bad news" in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Governments benefit from inflation as it increases their income through taxation on economic activity, while their debt levels do not increase with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Historically, the dollar has lost 99% of its value over the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This devaluation means that while the nominal amount of money in an account remains the same, its purchasing power significantly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>.

### Inflation as a Wealth Transfer

The speaker asserts that recent fiscal stimuli and money printing (e.g., in the US and Europe) have constituted "the largest transfer of wealth in history," primarily from the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. This new debt is financed by printing money, with the middle class ultimately paying the bill through various taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. The money given to consumers often ends up channeled through companies (e.g., restaurants, travel, leisure, car purchases), which are the beneficiaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Only those with productive assets, such as investments in the stock market, will see their value increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

## [[Investment Strategies During Inflation]]

Warren Buffett emphasizes that the only way to protect oneself in an inflationary environment is through [[investment opportunities during inflation | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Avoiding Certain Assets

*   **Liquidity/Fixed Income:** Investments in liquidity, bonds, or bank deposits are "very bad news" as they suffer from currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Buffett equates buying a 10-year bond yielding 2% to paying 50 times earnings for a business that won't grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
*   **Gold:** Gold, while tending to retain value against currency devaluation because it cannot be printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>, produces nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Buffett stated that owning an ounce of gold will always be an ounce of gold, but productive assets multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### Characteristics of Companies that Perform Well in Inflationary Periods

During the galloping inflation of the 1970s and 80s, Warren Buffett's holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, achieved average annual returns of 22% in the 70s and 40% in the 80s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. He did not invest in gold or oil companies but rather in companies with specific characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.

Buffett points to companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft as "fabulous businesses" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. The desirable characteristics for companies in an inflationary environment include:

*   **High Cash Flow Generation:** They "generate tons of cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   **Low Capital Reinvestment:** They "do not require capital" and have "low levels of reinvestment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:51">[00:14:51]</a>. This is crucial because if inflation causes the cost of things to double, a company with low reinvestment needs will see its profits less impacted than one requiring significant capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. Reinvestment levels below 20% of operating cash flow are considered good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>.
*   **Ability to Raise Prices:** These businesses should have the "pricing power" to pass on increased costs to consumers without significant loss of business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>. This is often true for companies selling products with high-profit margins where raw material costs are a small fraction of the final price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks:** Companies that buy back their own shares when trading at low multiples are favorable. This reduces the number of outstanding shares, increasing the ownership stake of existing shareholders in the company's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. This is the opposite of printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:04">[00:28:04]</a>.

### Case Studies: [[Examples of businesses that perform well in inflationary periods]]

#### HP (Hewlett-Packard)
Warren Buffett recently made a significant acquisition of HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. HP, a technology company, fits Buffett's criteria:
*   **Cash Flow & Reinvestment:** HP generates approximately $6 billion in operating cash flow annually but only requires around $580 million (about 10%) for reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks:** HP has systematically bought back shares, including $6 billion in the last two years, effectively withdrawing 15% of the company's stock from circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Business Segments:** While its printer cartridge business is declining (down 119% in profit last year), it is very profitable (18% margins) and now represents a smaller portion of the company's total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:49">[00:29:49]</a>. Its personal computer and peripherals line is growing and generated 129% profit last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:16">[00:30:16]</a>. The company is estimated to trade at around 8 times earnings, with the potential for free cash flow per share to double by 2026 due to share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

#### Starbucks
Starbucks is identified as an interesting company, especially after a recent price drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power:** Despite rising coffee prices (raw material), Starbucks can easily maintain profits because the cost of coffee is a very small component of the total price of a drink (e.g., $0.30 cost for a $4 coffee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:02">[00:36:02]</a>.
*   **Low Reinvestment:** Starbucks reinvests around 20% of its earnings, within the desirable limits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.
*   **Founder's Return:** The founder returning to the company has historically led to significant stock rallies after periods of decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **Growth:** The company has been growing through comparable sales increases (e.g., 3% above inflation in 2019) and opening new stores <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:26">[00:38:26]</a>.

#### CH Robinson
This logistics broker is described as a business "very protected against inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>.
*   **Inflation Benefits:** As transportation rates rise due to factors like increased truck driver salaries and oil prices, CH Robinson, which charges a percentage on transportation managed, sees its revenue increase significantly while its own costs (primarily technology and workers' salaries, not tied to volatile union agreements) remain relatively stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>. This allows the company to benefit from the "good part of the inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:33">[00:42:33]</a>.
*   **Low Reinvestment:** In 2021, CH Robinson generated $1 billion in cash flow but only needed to reinvest $94 million (9.4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantages:** The company thrives as an intermediary in an atomized market of transport companies and clients, leveraging its developed technology and trusted relationships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:01">[00:43:01]</a>.

#### Other Examples:
*   **Google:** Demonstrates high cash flow generation ($146 billion in 2024 estimates) and low reinvestment (20-27%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. It actively buys back shares, including $50 billion last year, propelling earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   **MT (Franchise Model):** Benefits from inflation because it charges a royalty on franchisees' sales, so if franchisees raise menu prices, MT's income increases without a proportional rise in its own costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. It has very high-profit margins (24% EBITDA) and extremely low reinvestment (e.g., $6 million reinvested from $140 million cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
*   **Iberdrola (Contrast):** Utility companies like Iberdrola can raise prices with inflation, but they have to reinvest a significant portion of their operating profit (e.g., 70% last year) into capital, which is not ideal in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Businesses (e.g., Micron):** Businesses like Micron (RAM memories) are characterized by significant volatility in sales and profits, making them riskier to invest in during periods of high inflation. Their reinvestment needs can also be very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>.
*   **Overpaying Risk (e.g., Teamviewer):** While Teamviewer's business is recurrent and has high margins with low reinvestment, overpaying for a good business (e.g., paying 38 times earnings) can lead to significant losses if the valuation drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

## Importance of Financial Education and Self-Investment

Warren Buffett advises individuals to "invest in yourself" and improve their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>. The "best [[investment opportunities in inflationary environments | investment]] you can make is in education" to increase your skills in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>. Being above average in one's profession ensures continued value and income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:57">[02:05:57]</a>.

It is emphasized that individual investors can potentially achieve better results than professional investors due to advantages like no liquidity limitations, broader investment universe, and not having to deal with capital inflows/outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:38">[02:42:38]</a>. Furthermore, the notion that professional investors have privileged information is a myth; Warren Buffett himself uses the same public information as anyone else <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:55">[01:02:55]</a>. The key is knowing how to process and analyze that information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:25">[01:03:25]</a>.

By understanding the principles of sound financial analysis, focusing on businesses with strong cash flows, low reinvestment needs, pricing power, and a history of share buybacks, investors can better [[navigating_inflation_and_interest_rate_hikes_in_investing | navigate inflationary periods]] and build wealth in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

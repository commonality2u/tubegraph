Michael Burry has recently become active on Twitter again, sharing his perspective on the market and identifying investment styles and sectors he believes will perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He is considered an expert investor who dedicates significant time to investment analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Track Record of Predictions

[[Michael Burry's stock market predictions | Michael Burry]] has a history of accurate market forecasts:
*   **2007-2008 Financial Crisis**: He warned about the impending real estate market collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.
*   **COVID-19**: He issued warnings about the economic implications of the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>.
*   **Early 2021**: He highlighted the significant risk of inflation, economic problems, and recession, which has since come to fruition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

He has recently taken pride in these accurate forecasts amidst the latest market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.

## Current Market Observations

[[Michael Burry's stock market predictions | Michael Burry]] analyzes the number of shares trading above their 200-day daily average as a technical and psychological indicator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. When many shares fall below this average, it suggests the bear market may be nearing a bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

Currently, only 13% of shares are trading above this average, a notably low figure compared to a typical bull market where it's around 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. However, he notes that during the 2009 lows, this figure reached 1%, and in 2020 during the lockdown, it was 2.8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. This suggests further potential declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

## The "Second Phase" of Decline

[[Michael Burry's market predictions and their implications | Burry]] had predicted a "second phase" of market decline driven by a "recession of profits," which appears to be unfolding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. An internal Federal Reserve document estimates that corporate profits could fall by 30% due to rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. The Federal Reserve has also stated its priority is to combat inflation, even if it causes a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.

### Inflation Concerns
Inflation in the Eurozone is not moderating, unlike in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>. Historically, when inflation exceeds 5% in developed economies, it has taken an average of 10 years to decline, with the U.S. taking 6 years on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. This indicates that inflation may be anchoring, posing a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>.

### Leading Economic Indicators
Michael Burry's analysis is supported by several leading economic indicators:
*   **Automobile Sector**: Carmax reported disastrous results, indicating consumer pressure due to inflation and a dismantling "car bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:00">[09:49:00]</a>.
*   **Retail Sector**: Companies like Nike and Adidas have published poor results due to excess inventory and decreased consumer spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:00">[10:35:00]</a>.
*   **Real Estate Sector**: U.S. housing prices are dropping, and inventories are increasing significantly in previously overheated states, signaling downward pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:59:00">[10:59:00]</a>.
*   **Semiconductor Sector**: Micron's lowered profit outlook indicates reduced consumer demand for discretionary products like smartphones and PCs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:49:00">[12:49:00]</a>.
*   **Transportation Sector**: FedEx's poor results also act as a leading indicator of economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.

These indicators confirm early symptoms of a possible economic recession and a drop in corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:27:00">[10:27:00]</a>.

## The Passive Investing Bubble

[[Michael Burry's investment strategy | Michael Burry]] warns of a bubble in passive investing, which has become a "self-fulfilling prophecy" over the last decade, attracting buyers and inflating indices like the S&P 500 and Nasdaq <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. He argues that this bubble, which took 10 years to inflate, will not deflate in just six to nine months of falling markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.

Passive investing, which buys entire indices regardless of valuation, is highly skewed, with the S&P 500's performance largely determined by only about 10 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. This concentration means these indices don't truly offer the diversification they promise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. This trend has made smaller, high-growth companies with strong business models much cheaper than larger, slower-growing companies included in major indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. Outflows from active funds to passive strategies also force active managers to sell, even if their stock selection is good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

## Comparison to the Year 2000

[[Michael Burry's stock market predictions | Burry]] feels the current environment is similar to the middle or end of the year 2000, when the market saw initial significant drops followed by a rebound and then more falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. He notes that "free cash flow" or profitable stocks are currently very cheap and overlooked, while "old momentum stocks" or "High flyers" (like Shopify, Roku, Palantir) that performed well last year are now suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

In the year 2000, the Fed's rate hikes burst the bubble in these types of stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. The initial phase saw everything decline (except the energy sector), and then, as in 2000, the "safest" and most beloved companies (e.g., Coca-Cola, McDonald's) are the last to experience significant drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.

## Opportunity for Value Investing

[[Michael Burry's investment strategy | Burry]] believes that this period marks a resurgence for "value investing" â€“ the strategy of selecting cheap stocks relative to their intrinsic value, as popularized by Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. In the early 2000s, when passive investing was also popular, value strategies performed exceptionally well during years of market decline, leading to capital flows shifting from passive to active strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.

The median stock within the S&P 500 is already cheaper than its historical average, approaching typical market lows of around 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. When excluding the 10 largest stocks, the remaining 490 companies in the S&P 500 (and medium/small companies) are trading at extremely low valuations, with the cheapest group even below 10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This situation, not seen for years, indicates significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

This period could be a very good decade for the value investment style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>.

## Outlook on the Market Downturn

Bear markets typically last an average of 365 days. As of the transcript, the current downturn had been going on for 9 months, suggesting the market could reach a valley within a year, on average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. However, more severe falls, like those in 1973-74 or 2000, can last two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>. While the current situation is severe, the extent of overvaluation may not be as extreme as during the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:05:00">[05:05:00]</a>.

Market bottoms often coincide with clear, notable events, usually involving statements or actions from the Federal Reserve that signal a shift in policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. The current significant outflows from stock ETFs and index funds (tens of billions per week) indicate panic levels historically associated with important bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. As a contrarian indicator, high outflows and fear often suggest that prices are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

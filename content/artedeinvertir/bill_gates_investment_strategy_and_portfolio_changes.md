[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest individuals, has recently cautioned about an impending threat that he believes could endanger the global economy. In response to this concern, he has begun to rapidly [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | sell all his shares]] across his portfolio, indicating that this new risk could be more severe than recent crises and requires decisive action <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This article will detail the nature of this threat, the additional reasons behind [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates' actions]], and the specific sectors and investments he is becoming cautious about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Predictive Acumen and Investment Success

[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] has a notable history of accurately predicting crises and demonstrating keen investment insight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. In 2019, he [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | warned that we could experience a crisis]] similar to a recent one, though his warnings went unheeded <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. He also has an [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_in_vaccine_stocks | excellent eye for investments]], having invested in the early stages of companies like [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_vaccine_stocks | Novavax]] and [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_vaccine_stocks | BioNTech]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. He even accurately predicted that [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_vaccine_stocks | Pfizer and BioNTech]] would be the first to develop a solution to the recent crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

## Portfolio Diversification

While [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] co-founded Microsoft, shares in the company currently represent only 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. He has significantly diversified his wealth into various other sectors and publicly traded shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. His investment moves are closely monitored globally due to his high success rate, attributed to his deep understanding of certain economic sectors and technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.

## Recent Warnings and Concerns

During a security conference in Munich, when asked about his greatest current concerns, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] stated that another pandemic is inevitable, albeit with a different pathogen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He also highlighted a [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | new threat]] for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. His recent statements to CNBC provide further insight into his accelerated [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | sale of shares]]:
*   He is concerned that "we may not have yet seen the worst of this crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.
*   He worries about public distrust in governments, stating that future crises would require decisive action in less than 6 months, necessitating trust in governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.
*   He believes social networks need regulation due to their role in creating societal and economic division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

These concerns explain his recent decision to [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | sell]] the majority of his technology shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

## Portfolio Shifts: Selling Strategy

Analysis of [[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates' recent investment activity]], made public due to U.S. stock market transparency rules for investors with over $100 million, reveals significant selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. His most recent report shows that he sold 12 out of his 18 holdings and has not bought any new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

His selling strategy highlights three key factors:

### Focus on Cyclical Companies
[[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] concentrated his sales on cyclical companies or those with high fixed costs, such as Caterpillar and John Deere shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. These shares are highly sensitive to economic cycles and tend to fall sharply when economic problems emerge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Divesting from Technology Companies
He sold all his Google shares, one of the few technology companies he held <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Since this sale was communicated, Google shares plummeted over 25% in less than 45 days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. Microsoft remains his only technology holding, representing barely 2% of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. This reduction in technology exposure has proven wise, as the Nasdaq technology index fell over 30% in the first five months alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
Last year, he also timely divested from all his Alibaba shares when they were trading at $225 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. A year later, Alibaba trades below $90, demonstrating another strategic move to preserve capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

### Selling Transportation Sector Holdings
[[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] also sold shares in the transportation sector, which had performed excellently after he invested at low levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. Specifically, he sold shares of UPS and FedEx, two of the largest global transport companies, and Canadian Pacific Railway, a major rail transport company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Other Sales
He has also successfully sold shares of Walmart, which collapsed due to recent supply chain issues and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

## Betting Against Tesla
[[bill_gates_selling_shares_and_reasons_behind_it | Bill Gates]] has also started betting against Tesla shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>, despite being a vocal advocate for climate change and renewable energies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. While he drives an electric car, it is a Porsche Taycan, not a Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Tesla shares have plummeted by over 50% recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, again demonstrating [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates'] astute investment vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. One potential reason for this decision is Tesla's high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. He understands the distinction between a "good company" and a "good investment," a lesson learned firsthand during the 2000 tech bubble when Microsoft shares, despite expected profit growth, plummeted 50% and took over 12 years to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Currently, Tesla trades at over 50 times earnings, significantly higher than the market average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>.

## Portfolio Shifts: Defensive Holdings

Despite his concerns, [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] remains invested, understanding that being fully liquid would erode his purchasing power due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The few stocks he has chosen to keep are from highly predictable and [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | very defensive sectors]], which are least affected during economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. He has deliberately excluded technology companies, which are currently underperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

### Ecolab (ECL)
Ecolab is a company focused on water treatment, sanitation, and disinfection products and services for businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. Its high competitive advantage stems from reputation and long-standing market presence, making it difficult for new competitors to gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. The company has multiplied its value by over 20 times on the stock market over the last two decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Ecolab has consistently increased its earnings per share at over 10% annually, even performing well during crises like 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Despite a recent 30% stock market fall, it fared better than its 40% drop in the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The company is poised to benefit from new regulations on water treatment and environmental respect, expecting to grow at over 15% annually in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>. Its current valuation of 29 times earnings for the next 12 months is favorable compared to its 5-year average of 33 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

### Waste Management (WM)
Waste Management is the leading garbage collection company in the United States, operating in a predictable, traditional, and crisis-resistant sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This aligns with [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates'] cautious outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. The growing trend of waste recycling and environmental respect will benefit this company and the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. The waste recycling market is projected to grow well above GDP, at 9% in the coming years, with North America seeing the most growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. Waste Management has multiplied by over 60 times on the stock market due to its significant competitive advantage in controlling regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Although the stock market has plummeted recently, these shares have been resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. Waste Management shares currently trade at their historical average valuation of around 26 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

### Coca-Cola FEMSA
He has also retained shares of Coca-Cola FEMSA, the national bottler of Coca-Cola for Mexico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>. This is another [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | very defensive and predictable business]], consistent with [[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates'] increasingly conservative investment approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

### [[bill_gates_investment_in_arable_land | Investment in Arable Land]]
Outside the stock market, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates]] has engaged in a massive accumulation of farmland, becoming the largest landowner in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This move has been highly successful, preceding the recent rise in food prices and global inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.

## The "New Threat"
The "new threat" that deeply concerns [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates]] and could jeopardize the global economy is terrorist attacks involving smallpox strains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:25">[00:11:25]</a>. He has warned governments that they should establish a new common fund of over $1 billion annually for the control and monitoring of this risk, which he believes could have severe societal and economic effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

In conclusion, [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates']] recent investment strategy reflects a deep concern for future global stability, leading him to significantly reduce exposure to cyclical and technology stocks while increasing his focus on [[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | defensive and predictable sectors]] and real assets like [[bill_gates_investment_in_arable_land | farmland]].

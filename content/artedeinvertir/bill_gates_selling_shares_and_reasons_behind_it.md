[[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]], one of the world's richest and most influential individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>, has recently started selling shares on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He has also indicated that a new crisis is "practically certain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. These actions and statements provide insight into [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates' economic predictions and concerns]] and his [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | investment strategy and portfolio changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Bill Gates as an Investor

[[bill_gates_investing_strategies | Bill Gates]] has amassed a fortune exceeding $120 billion, making him the fourth richest person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While widely recognized for co-founding Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>, he is also an accomplished investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. His investments in Microsoft shares constitute only 40% of his assets, with the remaining 60% diversified across a stock portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His expertise in the economy and stock market means his recent portfolio adjustments and statements warrant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Economic Predictions and Concerns

[[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates]] has a history of accurate predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>:
*   He warned that a pandemic like the one experienced was very likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.
*   He predicted which company would first develop the vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   He has provided an exact date for the end of the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

During a recent Q&A, when asked about the possibility of a new economic crisis similar to 2008, he responded that it is "certain" we will have such a crisis in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. He predicts the economy will return to normal by the end of 2022, contrary to the belief it might happen by the end of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

In a February interview with CNN, [[bill_gates_economic_predictions_and_concerns | Bill Gates]] expressed concerns that the current problem could last longer than expected, leading to severe economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. He highlighted a major risk for the economy: "the big problem is that we are not doing enough to end the pandemic globally. Vaccines are only reaching rich countries, which increases the risk that new variants will spread to other countries and return to the US, creating new infections. This is the main risk for the economy in the coming months" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

## Reasons for Selling Shares

[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates' investment strategy and portfolio changes]] can be observed through transparency rules requiring professional investors with over $100 million portfolios to periodically report their stock holdings, purchases, and sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

A recent report from the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation revealed that [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates]] has sold 11 of the 18 shares in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

His sales primarily include:
*   **Technology Stocks:** He has sold all his technology stocks, such as Amazon, Google, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These stocks had previously benefited significantly from the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Uber Shares:** All shares of Uber were sold due to its high valuation and fragility during an economic downturn, as the company doesn't produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.
*   **Alibaba:** Shares in Alibaba (ticker: BABA) were sold at $225 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Despite being a good company with growth prospects, recent problems with the Chinese regulator caused investor panic and a sharp fall in shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. This "tail risk" – unlikely but severe if it occurs – influenced the decision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

## The "Great Rotation" Investment Strategy

[[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio | Bill Gates' investment strategy and portfolio]] seems to be positioning itself for what is known as "the great rotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. In recent years, investments in technology, disruptive companies, or startups have seen strong revaluations, while more traditional and conservative companies have not benefited as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. However, these traditional companies are now trading at attractive valuations due to low interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

[[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates' focus on defensive investments and sectors]] suggests a shift of capital from disruptive or technological companies to traditional companies, particularly those that are more defensive and resilient to a potential economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

### Canadian National Railway (CNI)
*   **Description:** A railroad company listed in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Within the transportation sector, railroad companies are considered very safe investments due to the difficulty of rivals establishing parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Railways remain a cost-competitive technology for transporting raw materials and industrial goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Historically, its profits have grown at 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

[[bill_gates_focus_on_defensive_investments_and_sectors | Bill Gates]] also retains high-quality "blue-chip" companies like FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar, which are large-cap companies that provide adequate returns with few surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

## New High-Growth Investment

The only new stock [[bill_gates_investment_strategy_and_portfolio_changes | Bill Gates]] has recently bought is **Schrödinger (SDGR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Investment:** Over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **Description:** An innovative American company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. Its technological platform assists pharmaceutical companies in developing new drugs or vaccines more quickly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. It has high future growth potential; the US medical research and clinical trials market is valued at $47 billion annually, and Schrödinger currently bills only $150 million per year, though it is growing at over 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. The main challenge is its high valuation (over 40 times sales) and lack of current profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This investment appears to be a very long-term play, with potential for significant growth if the company captures a substantial portion of its market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

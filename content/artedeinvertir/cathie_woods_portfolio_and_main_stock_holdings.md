[[cathie_woods_investment_strategy | Cathie Wood]] has emerged as a prominent figure on Wall Street, achieving significant returns with her investment approach focused on innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. In 2020, her main investment fund saw a 170% return, and over the last five years, it has achieved over 700% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Background and Rise to Prominence
Until five years ago, [[cathie_woods_investment_strategy | Cathie Wood]] was largely unknown, working as an employee in investment banking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. Her meteoric rise began in 2015 when she founded her investment company, Ark Invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Ark Invest has grown from managing a small sum to over $30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Forbes magazine estimates her personal wealth exceeds $500 million, accumulated in a few years due to her investment success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

The Ark Innovation fund has multiplied investors' money by more than seven times, with a 170% increase in 2020 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This success is attributed to her revolutionary investment style, which differs significantly from traditional Wall Street methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: Innovation and Disruption
[[cathie_woods_investment_strategy | Cathie Wood]] defines herself as an investor in innovation and disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Unlike most Wall Street investors who focus on numerical financial and accounting aspects of a business, she sets aside traditional valuation and financial ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Her focus is on companies that are revolutionizing the world, such as Tesla or Spotify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. For her, financial metrics take a backseat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

She uses two basic premises for [[stock_investment_advice | investing]] in a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
1.  **Revolutionary and Transformative:** The company must be revolutionary and transform a mature sector (like Spotify in music) or directly create new sectors (like Teladoc in telemedicine, which didn't exist 10-15 years ago) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  **High Sales Growth (Even Without Current Profits):** The company must have high sales growth, even if it's not currently producing economic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Her theory is that many of these companies will dominate their markets and reinvest everything they earn to grow and gain market share, similar to Amazon's early strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. Amazon spent decades losing money due to high reinvestment for rapid growth and market share, eventually becoming profitable and enriching shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

She avoids traditional, high-quality companies like Nestl√© because they operate in mature sectors with limited growth capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Favorite Sectors
Ark Invest identifies six favorite sectors for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>:
*   Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Autonomous Cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>
*   Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   3D Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Financial Technology (Fintech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

## Market Warnings and Outlook
[[cathie_woods_investment_strategy | Cathie Wood]] has warned investors about a "major bubble" and "enormous risk" in passive or indexed management, specifically mentioning major indices like the Standard & Poor's 500, Dow Jones, and MSCI World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. She is not the first investor to express this concern; [[michael_burrys_investment_portfolio_and_the_six_stocks_he_holds | Michael Burry]] also warned about a potential bubble in these financial products that could eclipse the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

She explains that indices like the S&P 500 are full of "average companies" and are designed for an inflationary world, which has been experienced in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. However, she believes we are heading towards a deflationary scenario due to high technological innovation and significant cost reduction across many economic areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. In this future scenario, when these indices perform poorly and the bubble bursts, the market will appreciate highly innovative and technologically disruptive companies like those in which she invests, as they are not included in these indices and would not be harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

In a recent CNBC interview, her forecast for the next year indicated she doesn't believe we are in an equity bubble until there's a rotation of bonds towards equities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. She noted that while older populations are drawn to bonds, younger investors (millennials) prefer to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. She highlighted fixed income and bonds as areas where most money has flowed recently, and where many experts see a tremendous bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

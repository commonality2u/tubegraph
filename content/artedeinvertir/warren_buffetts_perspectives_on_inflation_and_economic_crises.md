[[warren_buffetts_warning_about_a_financial_crisis | Warren Buffett]] has stated that the next crisis is "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He has also provided [[warren_buffetts_recommendations_for_inflations | a series of tips]] on how to adapt to the new situation of inflation and other risks he has identified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Current Economic Climate and Inflation
[[warren_buffetts_market_insights_and_strategies | Warren Buffett]] commented during an annual conference that substantial price increases are being observed due to inflation, which the world is accepting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He noted that steel prices were increasing daily and described the economy as "very overheated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

He warned that inflation is higher, and will continue to be higher, than people anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A "second wave" of inflation is projected for 2023, when wages are expected to rise, updating with the current high inflation of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This rise in wages is already evident, with companies like Walmart struggling to find truck drivers and offering salaries up to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Currency Devaluation and Debt
[[Warren Buffett]] stated that the easiest solution to the problem will be the devaluation of the dollar or the euro, as the same situation is occurring in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. He views holding dollars or euros, or investments in liquidity, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits, as "very bad news" because the money will devalue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Governments aim to devalue currency to increase their income via inflation (charging a percentage on economic activity) while their debt levels remain the same, effectively reducing the real value of their debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Buffett noted that the dollar has lost approximately 99% of its value in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. He illustrated this by comparing purchasing power:
*   In the 1970s, $6.30 bought 17 oranges; today, it cannot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>.
*   In 2020, $1 could buy a basic McDonald's hamburger or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.
*   90 years ago, $20 bought 670 dozen eggs; today in the US, $20 buys only 10 dozen eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

### Inflation as Wealth Transfer
[[Warren Buffett]] describes inflation as "one of the biggest scams there is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. The "trick of inflation" is that people still see the same amount of money in their accounts, but its purchasing power is significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

He views the situation since the confinement (COVID-19 pandemic) as the largest transfer of wealth in history, likening it to a "gigantic robbery of the middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Fiscal stimuli and new money printed by central banks (like the Fed) are financed by new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The burden of this debt, despite rhetoric about the wealthy paying more, falls primarily on the middle class, which accounts for 90% of developed countries' income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

Government spending, such as the European recovery plan of nearly two trillion euros until 2027, ultimately benefits companies that build infrastructure or provide digitalization services (e.g., Amazon, Alphabet, consulting firms) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This prosperity and aid are reflected in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Therefore, people who do not invest will not benefit from these plans, but the middle class will pay for the debt through various taxes (VAT, gasoline taxes, income tax, inheritance tax) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>.

The money given to consumers often ends up being spent on restaurants, travel, leisure, and cars, channeling funds through companies that benefit and are more resilient to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>.

### Consequences of Money Printing
[[Warren Buffett]] stated that "all actions have consequences" regarding money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. He believes it is "crazy to think that 85 percent of the American population has received these checks for 1,400 dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, especially given that years ago, 50% of Americans couldn't save $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This immense money printing has caused the debt levels of the four main world economies to rise from $15 trillion to $25 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

He notes that it's normal for stock markets to rise, companies to benefit, spending to occur, and interest rates to be reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. He concludes that the only way to protect oneself in this environment is to invest, as one cannot control government actions or money printers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Countries like Argentina and Venezuela, experiencing high annual inflation (30-40%), exemplify the necessity of investing to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies and Insights]] for Inflationary Environments
[[Warren Buffett]]'s strategy for protecting himself from inflation, partly due to his large liquidity, includes recent acquisitions of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. He made a $12 billion acquisition last week and another nearly $5 billion investment in HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>.

He highlights that during inflationary periods like the 1970s and 1980s, his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, achieved average annual returns of 22% (1970s) and 40% (1980s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. Notably, during the galloping inflation crisis in the US in 1974-1975, he did not invest in gold mining, oil, or raw materials companies, but rather in other sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

### Characteristics of Desirable Investments
[[Warren Buffetts Investment Tips | Warren Buffett's investment advice]] for inflationary environments emphasizes companies with specific characteristics:
*   **Generate tons of cash flow:** Companies like Google, Apple, and Microsoft are considered "fabulous businesses" because they generate significant cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **Require low levels of reinvestment/capital:** These businesses do not require substantial capital to operate or grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. Reinvestment levels below 20% of operating cash flow are considered good; Buffett avoids capital-intensive businesses where reinvestment might be 50-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:13">[00:27:13]</a>. This is crucial because inflation increases the cost of capital investments, reducing profits for capital-intensive businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>.
*   **Ability to buy back shares:** Companies that buy back their own shares when trading at low multiples are favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This reduces the number of shares outstanding, increasing the ownership stake for remaining shareholders and driving up earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Examples in his portfolio include HP, Occidental Petroleum (Oxy), Apple, Moody's, and Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:50">[00:28:50]</a>.
*   **High profit margins:** Businesses with high gross margins (e.g., close to 60%) and operating profit margins (e.g., above 15% EBIT or 20% EBITDA) are preferred because they can absorb rising raw material costs and still maintain profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:29">[00:36:29]</a>.

### Criticisms of Traditional "Safe" Investments
[[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] has given his opinion that investments traditionally considered "conservative" or low-risk, such as money quietly deposited in a bank or in bonds/treasury bills, are not viable in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. He compares buying a 10-year bond today yielding 2% to "paying 50 times earnings for a business that, unlike a bond, is not going to grow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. He argues that fixed income investments have a "very complicated future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

He also criticized gold as an inflation hedge. In a 2011 conference, he said that owning an ounce of gold will always just be an ounce of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. In contrast, productive assets like stocks, real estate (houses, apartments), or farmland generate dividends, income, or food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. While gold tends to retain value because it cannot be printed like fiat money, it does not multiply or generate income, unlike shares in well-managed companies that increase in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Investment in Oneself
Beyond financial investments, [[Warren Buffett]] advises individuals to "invest in yourself" and improve their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. He believes the best investment one can make is in education to increase skills in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. He suggests that if a person is above average in their profession and adds value, they will do well, regardless of currency devaluation, because their services remain valuable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:44">[00:20:44]</a>.

## Market Behavior and Interest Rates
While there should be concern about a crisis, actions should proceed with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>. The market is seeing capital outflows, particularly in Europe, which is a good indication for the future when this trend reverses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>.

Regarding interest rate hikes, historically, slow increases are less dangerous for the stock market than fast ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. Even during periods of rapid interest rate increases (e.g., 1973, 1980s), [[Warren Buffett]]'s results were solid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

## Examples of Preferred Companies
Companies that align with [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies during inflation | Warren Buffett's investment strategies during inflation]] include:
*   **HP:** A large technology company that generates significant cash flow ($6 billion in 2021-2022) but requires low reinvestment (around 10% of earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. It also actively buys back its shares, eliminating 15% of the company's stock in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:51">[00:27:51]</a>.
*   **Starbucks:** A good business capable of raising prices even when raw material costs (like coffee) increase, due to its high profit margins (e.g., gross margins close to 60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. It requires low reinvestment (around 20% of what it earns) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. The return of founder Howard Schultz has historically led to significant stock rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.
*   **CH Robinson:** A logistics broker that charges a percentage on transportation it manages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:12">[00:40:12]</a>. This business benefits from inflation, as transportation rates rise due to increased driver salaries and oil prices, but its own costs (e.g., labor, capital investment) do not rise proportionally, allowing it to expand profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:26">[00:41:26]</a>. It operates with a low reinvestment rate (around 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:42">[00:47:42]</a>.
*   **Google (Alphabet):** Mentioned by [[Warren Buffett]] as a "fabulous business" that generates significant cash flow and requires low capital reinvestment (20-27%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. Google also accelerates share repurchases, with $50 billion bought back last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>.
*   **MTI (Domino's Pizza, etc.):** A franchise business that does not own restaurants but receives royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. If inflation causes menu prices to rise, MTI's royalties increase without a proportional rise in its own operating costs, allowing it to benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. It has very high profit margins (24% EBITDA) and an exceptionally low reinvestment rate (4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.

### Companies to be cautious with:
*   **Iberdrola (Utilities):** While such companies can raise electricity prices during inflation to maintain profits, they have a "bad side" as they require significant reinvestment (e.g., Iberdrola reinvests almost 70% of its operating profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:51">[00:53:51]</a>.
*   **Micron (Cyclical businesses):** Companies like Micron, involved in RAM memories, are cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. Their revenue and profits fluctuate wildly, making future earnings difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. They also require very high reinvestment levels (e.g., Micron reinvested $10 billion to generate $12 billion in income in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:48">[01:01:48]</a>.
*   **Teamviewer:** While it has good qualities like subscription-based revenue, recurrent income, high margins, and low reinvestment, the risk lies in "overpaying" for the valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:03">[01:09:03]</a>.
*   **Loss-making companies:** Investing in companies that are not making money is "tremendously complex" because it requires guessing future growth and profit margins, which are highly unreliable for more than a year out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:39">[01:09:39]</a>.

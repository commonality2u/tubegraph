Ray Dalio, a renowned economist and investor, predicts that a new world order will usher in an unprecedented economic recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He identifies three critical challenges that he considers the most significant of our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. According to Dalio, an economic war is brewing that will lead to the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | decline of the United States]] and its allies in favor of [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | China]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He even specified a date for a drastic shift in the economic outlook, which will have significant consequences for the value of money, investments, and currencies like the [[decline_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Influence and Predictions
Dalio, founder of the world's largest hedge fund with over $100 trillion in assets under management, is a regular at the Davos forum and is highly respected in financial markets for successfully navigating major economic crises such as those in 2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His new book, "The New World Order," condenses his views on the serious economic changes ahead and the need for preparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

In a recent interview with CNBC, Dalio explained the date he believes these important changes will begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. He stated that the three forces currently at play are the greatest he has ever witnessed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Historically, the simultaneous occurrence of these three problems has resulted in economic recessions, significant changes, the fall of empires, and the decline of major world currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

## The Three Forces Driving Economic Change

### 1. Class Struggle and Social Gap
The first problem highlighted by Dalio is the growing social gap between classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. He describes it as a struggle between "those who have and those who don't," with both sides determined to win <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Data shows that 1% of the American population owns increasing wealth, while the poorest 50% own progressively less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Recent inflation has exacerbated this gap, as the poorest 50%, lacking assets like stocks or real estate, have borne the brunt of its effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### 2. Enormous Debt
The second problem is the immense debt accumulated by both the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Dalio observes a decreasing demand for United States debt, considering American bonds a very risky investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. He predicts two potential outcomes: either interest rates on debt will rise, or the state will be forced to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Printing more money to solve recessions will inevitably lead to higher inflation, further widening the gap between the rich and poor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### 3. The Rise of China and the Decline of the US
The third critical issue is the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | rise of China]] and the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | decline of the United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This shift is expected to significantly impact the value of the [[decline_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]] and its status as a global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. For the past 70 years, the United States has dominated the international political landscape by controlling institutions such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, but this is set to change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>.

Dalio illustrates that the United States is entering a decline phase, characterized by high debt levels, social struggles, and currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. Conversely, [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | China]] is in an ascending phase of wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Prediction for the Future
Dalio predicts that in five years, the world will be "totally different" due to the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | rise of China]], the class struggle, and the ongoing debt bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Technological changes, such as Artificial Intelligence, could also introduce unpredictable scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This implies that by 2030, significant [[global_economic_power_shifts_by_2030 | global economic power shifts]] are anticipated.

## Ray Dalio's Recommendations for Investors

In light of this complex environment, Dalio offers advice for small investors:

*   **Invest Globally and Combat Inflation**: Investors must prevent their money from losing value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. The only way is to invest, as the value of assets like stocks and gold has risen due to new debt and money creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. He advises against holding "safe" assets like liquidity or fixed income, as their value will likely decrease in inflationary scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Instead, real assets with consistent demand, such as stocks, real estate, or gold, are expected to perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.
*   **Diversify Wisely**: Given the high uncertainty and risks, it is crucial to learn to diversify without reducing performance expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Good diversification can reduce risk by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. Dalio recommends investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Dalio's Portfolio Strategy
Dalio popularized the "four seasons" portfolio management theory, which emphasizes diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. His current preferred sector for investment is technology, with holdings in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. He has been selling positions in the banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, as these are sensitive to the economic cycle and may face future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

While he usually maintains a significant portion of his portfolio in long-term debt or bonds, his main positions are now in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Another favored sector for this environment is stable or defensive consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, or Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. Dalio has also invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF (IWM), which tends to perform better when interest rates drop and liquidity increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

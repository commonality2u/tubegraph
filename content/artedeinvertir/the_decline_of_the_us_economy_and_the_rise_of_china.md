Renowned economist and investor Ray Dalio has warned that the world is on the brink of significant economic changes, potentially representing the largest shift in society and the economy in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. These transformations are expected to have serious implications for currency values like the dollar and the euro, real estate investments, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>.

Dalio, who manages over $100 billion through his company Bridgewater, is known for accurately predicting major economic shifts, helping to protect investment portfolios from crises like those in 2008 and the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. Having published his book "The New World Order," he aims to inform society about adapting to this new economic reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## Imminent Economic Changes

Ray Dalio predicts that the world will begin to change significantly within the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. He identifies three converging problems:
1.  **Monetary problem and debt cycle:** A recession coupled with significant social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.
2.  **Social inequality:** The widening gap between classes is leading to the rise of populist parties, which Dalio believes will negatively impact economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:00">[02:45:00]</a>. A stark example is that 90% of the American population owns increasingly less wealth, with a select 10% owning 75% of the wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The COVID-19 crisis exacerbated this, as governments issued significant debt to save the economy, which will be paid by the working class who haven't benefited from recent economic booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
3.  **Decline of US competitive advantage:** The [[rise_of_china_and_decline_of_the_united_states | United States]] is losing its competitive edge to China, which will have serious consequences for the West and its wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

## The Decline of the US Economy

According to Ray Dalio, the United States, a 75-year-old empire, is showing clear signs of decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. The US is in a terminal phase of its credit cycle, marked by high debt and extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. Historically, the US could issue debt and then print new dollars if it couldn't repay it, a practice that would typically cause a currency's value to collapse in other economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. However, the dollar's value was preserved due to the US's dominant global economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:00">[04:32:00]</a>.

The concern now is what will happen as China surpasses the US in gross domestic product and global relevance in terms of military, technological innovation, and influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. Previous crises were solved by printing new dollars, but a future crisis could lead to people losing confidence in the [[decline_of_the_us_dollar | dollar]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>. In 2020 alone, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:15:00">[05:15:00]</a>.

Dalio predicts that within five years, foreigners who have been lending money to the US may stop doing so, and the dollar may no longer be as readily accepted worldwide for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. The US has been spending more than it earns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:57:00">[05:57:00]</a>.

The [[discussion_on_global_economic_changes_especially_related_to_china_and_the_us | US is entering a decline phase]], characterized by a high level of debt and alarming quantities of money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:06:00">[07:06:00]</a>. This will have a significant impact on the value of investments, the dollar, currencies, and real estate investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

## The Rise of China

In contrast to the US, China is in an "ascending phase," characterized by the creation of wealth and the accumulation of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. It is expected that China will surpass the United States in terms of gross domestic product around the year 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>. Ray Dalio questions what will happen to the dollar and its value as a currency in that scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:38:00">[05:38:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Advice

To protect savings and investments in this new economic scenario, Ray Dalio offers the following advice:

### 1. Avoid Liquidity
With extensive money printing, inflation reduces purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. People are thus forced to become investors in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### 2. Diversify Effectively
Diversification is crucial, encompassing different countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The goal is for one asset to rise when another falls, maintaining a relatively stable portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### The "Four Seasons Portfolio"
Dalio's "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory emphasizes preparing a portfolio for both good and bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. His approach to portfolio management to achieve excellent results includes:

*   **Stocks (40%):** In the current economic environment, where inflation is high but expected to drop, emerging market stocks perform best, followed by small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>. Ray Dalio's portfolio includes significant investments in ETFs related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Small-cap stocks offer higher growth potential and are less followed by the market, making them potentially undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:00">[12:32:00]</a>. Large investors like Dalio face liquidity challenges with small-cap companies, often turning to ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>.

*   **Gold (small percentage, never exceeding 10%):** This can be achieved through ETFs related to gold mining companies or physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. However, in the current scenario (high inflation, expected to drop), gold is one of the worst-performing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00">[10:16:00]</a>.

*   **Bonds (up to 40%):** Bonds, including inflation-protected ones, provide a defensive component to the portfolio, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. However, Dalio notes a "bubble" in the bond market due to extensive money printing by governments, leading him to adopt a more conservative allocation to this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

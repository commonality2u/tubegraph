## Overview of Predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>
Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater team anticipate a significant new risk for the stock market starting in September, potentially leading to an additional drop of 20% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This risk is expected to be difficult to avoid and will impact all investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. Fortune magazine also reported Dalio's view that the world is experiencing a "totally different" investment landscape, with an expectation for stock prices to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

## Key Forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>
Bridgewater's statement predicts a drop in inflation that will be accompanied by a recession, in contrast to the market's current expectation of inflation falling without a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Furthermore, Dalio believes inflation will be more persistent than what the market is currently anticipating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>.

The firm explicitly states that asset prices "clearly have that going down" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. They project stock market drops of 20% to 25% with the withdrawal of stimulus measures set to begin in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>, signaling a period where "everything is going to get much more complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Underlying Risks & Factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>
According to Dalio's analysis, the markets face three major risks for the next 6 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
1.  **Pressure from multiples:** The S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple, while having fallen, remains near its historical average, which historically occurred with higher interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. Dalio notes this risk is somewhat implicit in current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Drop in profits:** A recession typically causes corporate profits to fall by 10-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This risk is not yet fully accounted for in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity in the system:** When money is easy and abundant, it encourages investment and business confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This is heavily influenced by interest rates and the central bank's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

These three risks are interconnected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>:
*   Aggressive rate hikes by the Fed can lead to a recession, causing profits to drop and negatively impacting stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   If the Fed avoids a recession by not raising rates aggressively, inflation remains a problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.
*   It is "very likely" that at least two of these three risks will materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

### Quantitative Tightening (QT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>
A significant new risk identified is quantitative tightening (QT), which is the opposite of quantitative easing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. While interest rate hikes have caused drops in valuations, QT involves the withdrawal of money from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This process of withdrawing money, which was previously printed in large quantities during the 2020 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, is set to fully commence in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. This will involve a monthly withdrawal of $95 billion, equating to almost a trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>. Historically, periods of money withdrawal (QT) correlate with worse market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

## Recommendations for Investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>
Ray Dalio and Bridgewater acknowledge that investors cannot completely free themselves from the predicted market fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Their advice focuses on risk reduction and diversification:
*   **Reduce risks:** Investors should aim to mitigate their exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>.
*   **Diversify globally (asset level):** This means diversifying across asset classes, such as holding bonds in addition to quality stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Invest in quality, non-cyclical stocks:** Focus on companies with low debt that are not highly sensitive to the economic cycle or drops in returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:12">[00:14:12]</a>.
*   **Diversify sectorally:** Avoid sectors particularly vulnerable to the economic cycle, such as automotive, banks, insurance, construction, and transportation (e.g., airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>. Raw material and materials companies are also expected to suffer if liquidity is withdrawn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:57">[00:14:57]</a>. Gold is not considered a historical safe haven in these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.
*   **Focus on long-term:** Despite short-term volatility, the long-term outlook for well-selected stocks remains positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

## Market Context and Historical Performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:06">[01:22:06]</a>
Dalio's perspective aligns with the idea that market downturns, while challenging, present opportunities for those who are prepared and understand underlying company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:29">[01:19:29]</a>. He emphasizes focusing on what a company will earn in five to ten years and investing in those with strong growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:09">[03:33:09]</a>. He advocates for investing in companies that have clear competitive advantages and are gaining market share, even in mature sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:58">[01:59:58]</a>.

Dalio's approach stresses that while macro events and central bank actions can cause short-term volatility, long-term success is determined by a company's ability to grow its profits and return value to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:40">[03:48:40]</a>. He also notes that investor sentiment, which influences multiples, can create opportunities when discouragement is high and valuations are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:57">[02:29:57]</a>.

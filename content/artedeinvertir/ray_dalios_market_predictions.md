Ray Dalio is recognized as one of the world's most successful and largest investment fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. He is often referred to as the "Steve Jobs of the stock market" due to his innovative approach to investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Over the past 40 years, he has achieved tremendous success in the investment world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>.

He currently manages the largest investment fund globally, with assets exceeding $130 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. To provide context, this fund is larger than the economies of some countries like Ecuador, Guatemala, or the Dominican Republic, whose gross domestic products are less than $100 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

Dalio's personal fortune is estimated at over $18 billion, and he has generated more than $56 billion for his investors <a class="yt="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. His beginnings were humble, starting with managing only $10,000 from his small apartment in New York <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: The All Weather System

The primary innovation introduced by Ray Dalio in financial markets was his portfolio management system, which he named "All Weather" or "The Four Seasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This system prioritizes predictable returns and low volatility over seeking the highest returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>. The system has historically provided an average annual return of 12% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. In rare years with losses, such as 2008, losses were only 3%, while the general market fell up to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Market Predictions]]

In a recent interview, Ray Dalio stated that the stock market could experience a "lost decade" for equities, characterized by low returns and high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

### Reasons for the "Lost Decade" Prediction

Ray Dalio's vision stems from several key factors impacting the global economy:

*   **Peak Globalization and Supply Chain Reshoring**: He believes globalization has reached its maximum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. Due to conflicts like that between the U.S. and China, multinational corporations are shifting their focus from cost optimization to security, leading them to bring supply chains closer to home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. For instance, Intel and TSM have announced new factories in the U.S., despite higher manufacturing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. Globalization was a main driver of profitability in the developed world over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.
*   **Declining Profit Margins**: A major concern for Dalio is the current high profit margins enjoyed by some companies, which are a result of the cost optimization process over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>. Over the last 30 years, large companies' profit margins increased from 5% to 10% during the period of globalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. The evolution of earnings per share is the primary factor determining a stock's future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>.
*   **Increased Debt and Lower Profitability for Companies**: Even if corporate profits recover post-crisis, many companies will emerge with lower profit margins and increased debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. This means future profits will be used to pay interest and repay debt, rather than to grow the business or reward shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Investor Caution

It is advisable to consider statements from large investors like Ray Dalio with caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Their investment decisions involve vast sums, making the general market behavior highly influential on their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. Small investors, however, have the advantage of being able to select specific companies with better prospects or risk/reward ratios, rather than investing solely in the market as a whole <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

## Recent Investments/Opportunities in the Context of Dalio's Insights

While not all are direct statements from Ray Dalio, the video presents investment examples that align with or are discussed in the context of his market views, suggesting potential opportunities even within a challenging outlook.

### 1. McDonald's (MCD)

Ray Dalio recently purchased McDonald's shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Listed under the ticker MCD at approximately $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, McDonald's has been one of the best investments since its IPO over 40 years ago, multiplying its value by more than 1,000 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

*   **Business Model**: McDonald's operates on a franchise model, where franchisees pay royalties for sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>. Crucially, McDonald's also owns the land and buildings where many restaurants are located, allowing them to raise rents, control franchisees, and benefit from real estate appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. In a recent year, over $7.5 billion of McDonald's $11 billion income from franchisees came from real estate rentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, leading to the saying that McDonald's is a real estate business, not just fast food <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **Resilience**: McDonald's business model is resilient to economic environments, even achieving positive results in 2008 and seeing shares fall only 20% while the market dropped 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>. Over 70% of its income comes from franchisee rents, which continue even if restaurants are closed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Its pick-up and delivery services have helped it weather crises better than other restaurant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>. Sales were estimated to drop by only 12% for the current year, with a rebound of over 15% projected for the following year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   **Growth & Valuation**: McDonald's shares rarely trade cheaply due to the business's quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>, trading at a future P/E of 22 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. Earnings per share are projected to grow between 7% and 12% annually, driven by new restaurant openings, price increases, and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This could lead to a 5-year target price of $250 to $320 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.

### 2. Indian Stock Market (ETF - INDA)

Ray Dalio's recent investments include an ETF, specifically LTE eFE, which replicates the performance of the Indian stock market, listed in the U.S. under the ticker INDA at about $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

*   **Macro Investor Approach**: As a macro investor, Ray Dalio invests in specific themes like gold, bonds, or the economy of certain countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. ETFs allow him to execute this strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.
*   **India's Market Accessibility**: India is a relatively closed market for foreign investors, making it difficult to open securities accounts and select individual companies directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Investing via an ETF provides an easier way to access the Indian market without bureaucratic complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.
*   **Economic Prospects**: India is considered one of the countries with the best economic prospects for the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>, with attractive valuations for its listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Some analysts even suggest it could replicate China's past success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>. India has experienced impressive growth rates of over 7% per year, surpassing China and the 3% average growth of other economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Growth Drivers**: India possesses key ingredients for becoming a global power, including a young population, pro-capitalist reforms, cheap labor, low national debt, and its proximity to major world powers like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Given its stronger growth and prospects compared to the U.S. stock market's historical 8% annual return, India could yield higher performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

### 3. Inditex (ITX)

Inditex, the owner of Zara clothing stores, is listed in Spain under the ticker ITX at about 24 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. It is considered one of the best companies listed in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

*   **Company Background**: Founded by Amancio Ortega, Inditex achieved immense success with the "fast fashion" concept, making Ortega the richest man in Spain and the tenth wealthiest globally, with a net worth over $63 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
*   **Business Model & Resilience**: Inditex has a resilient business model with strong competitive advantages in distribution, design, and business culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>. Unlike rivals like H&M, Zara has successfully adapted to the internet era, with over 20% of its sales now online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:22">[00:13:22]</a>. While some stores are currently closed or partially operating, Inditex owns most of its premises, reducing pressure from rent payments that affect other retail companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Crucially, Inditex has no debt, ensuring its long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>.
*   **Future Growth**: Despite being a mature company, Inditex has significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. For example, Germany, with double Spain's population and higher purchasing power, has only 80 Zara stores compared to Spain's 300+ <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>.
*   **Comparable Sales**: A vital metric for retail companies is the evolution of "comparable sales" or "same-store sales," which measures growth excluding new store openings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Inditex has shown solid and consistent comparable sales over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>. The company projects comparable sales growth of 4-6% in coming years, augmented by new store openings, potentially reaching nearly 10% annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Inditex shares typically do not trade at an attractive valuation because the market recognizes the business's high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>. When stores fully reopen, Inditex is estimated to earn over one euro per share, resulting in a current P/E of 24 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:33">[00:15:33]</a>. Future performance will be driven by earnings per share growth rather than multiple expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:44">[00:15:44]</a>. With 4-6% comparable sales growth, an additional 3% from new stores, and a 3% annual dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>, the 5-year target price could range from 35 euros to 45 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>, representing an interesting potential for a high-quality, debt-free company with strong competitive advantages and good future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:18">[00:16:18]</a>.

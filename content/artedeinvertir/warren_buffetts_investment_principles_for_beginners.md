[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] is considered the greatest investor of all time, with an initial $1,000 investment early in his career growing to over $34 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. During a university lecture, he revealed seven basic principles that contributed to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These principles are especially useful for those new to investing or with limited capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## 1. Invest in Good Companies and Avoid Mediocre Businesses

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies | Warren Buffett]] advises against investing in low-quality businesses, even if their stocks are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. While such stocks might offer quick 30-40% gains, they don't generate long-term value, preventing investors from benefiting from the compound capitalization effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>.

Investing in exceptional businesses that generate significant long-term value, even at a slightly higher initial valuation, offers two main advantages:
*   **Reduced Workload**: The analysis is done once, and returns can theoretically be reaped for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
*   **Compound Capitalization Effect**: Exceptional businesses can multiply in value by 8, 10, 20, or even 50 times in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

For example, General Motors' stock has shown little movement over the past decade, only offering short-term gains before needing to be sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. In contrast, Moody's (NYSE: MC), a debt rating agency and a favorite of [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]], has multiplied by over 10 times in the last 10 years due to its long-term value generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Identifying Good Businesses
Two primary methods exist for identifying good businesses:
1.  **Fundamental Analysis**: Study the company's fundamentals, including its operations, profit and loss account, and balance sheet. Look for consistent growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  **Stock Performance**: For beginners, observe a stock's historical performance. If a company hasn't significantly multiplied in value over 10-20 years, it's likely not a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. After identifying a good business, assess its valuation, as one should not invest at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## 2. Understand Companies Before Investing
[[warren_buffetts_recent_investment_strategies_and_tips | Warren Buffett]] stresses that understanding a business goes beyond knowing its products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. It means having the certainty that the company will generate greater profits in 10 years than it currently does <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A key to his long-term success is avoiding investments in very new or rapidly changing sectors, as their future profitability is difficult to analyze <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

For example, McDonald's (NYSE: MCD) is a favorite investment because its business model (people eating hamburgers) is not easily disrupted by technological changes like the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Its revenue generation is straightforward, risks are low, and future profit growth is predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This understanding has allowed McDonald's shares to multiply by over three times in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.

In contrast, the rapidly changing technology sector, exemplified by Intel, can be challenging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Despite its past dominance, competition from companies like NVIDIA has radically altered Intel's profit outlook, leading to poor stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

## 3. Make the Most of Investment Opportunities
When a good investment opportunity arises in an understandable business, [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_market_outlook | Warren Buffett]] advocates for taking a significant position in one's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This concentrated approach has been crucial to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

*   **Apple (NASDAQ: AAPL)**: Currently, Apple represents 47% of [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]]'s portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. When he identified the opportunity in 2016, he invested over $15 billion, leading to a six-fold multiplication of shares and nearly $100 trillion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   **Historical Pattern**: Historically, [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]]'s five main positions have consistently represented over 50% of his total portfolio, demonstrating high conviction once he decides to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola**: After identifying Coca-Cola as a good investment, his decisive investment led to a more than 20-fold increase in shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>.
*   **American Express**: Early in his career, he allocated 20% of his portfolio to American Express, which has since multiplied over 200 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] also advises not to regret missed opportunities for investments one doesn't understand (e.g., Bitcoin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Instead, patiently wait for understandable opportunities and act decisively when they appear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## 4. Don't Sell Unless the Business Has Changed Fundamentally
Extraordinary stocks often experience significant temporary drops (30-50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. During such periods of panic, [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] recommends ignoring market price fluctuations and focusing on whether the company's ability to generate profits or its competitive position has fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. If no fundamental change has occurred, the best action is either to do nothing or increase one's position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

*   **Tesla (NASDAQ: TSLA)**: Tesla's shares have multiplied over 90 times in the last decade, yet they experienced 8 market corrections with drops over 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. An investor who panicked and sold during these drops would have missed out on long-term returns because the underlying business had not changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Selling When Fundamentals Change**: Conversely, [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy | Warren Buffett]] advises selling shares without hesitation when new risks emerge or the business fundamentally changes, even if the stock hasn't fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He recently did this with IBM shares, selling them entirely due to fundamental changes despite their sideways market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

Stryker (NYSE: SYK), a medical equipment manufacturer, is an example of a stable business with tailwinds from an aging population, expected to generate increasing and stable profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Its history shows multiple 20% drops during long-term upward trends, reinforcing the idea of holding through volatility if fundamentals are sound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>.

## 5. Invest Using Facts and Not Emotions
Allowing emotions to dictate investment decisions is a primary reason many investors fail in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. [[insights_on_warren_buffetts_views | Warren Buffett]] observed that investors become overly excited during bull markets, buying stocks that have already risen, but ignore stocks that haven't performed well, even if they are good businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This emotional behavior creates "giant opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

*   **Disney (NYSE: DIS)**: For five years, Disney's stock performed sideways while the rest of the market surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. However, in recent months, it more than doubled, despite being the same business with the same assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This created an opportunity for rational investors who looked at the facts rather than following the emotional market sentiment.

## 6. Invest in Companies with Talented and Integral Managers
Behind every stock is a business run by people, and their talent and integrity fundamentally impact the business's future and stock evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:48">[00:12:48]</a>.

*   **Amazon (NASDAQ: AMZN)**: [[warren_buffetts_recent_statements_and_investments | Warren Buffett]]'s investment in Amazon shares highlights the importance of management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, has proven enormous business talent and has consistently treated shareholders with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Aligned Interests**: [[warren_buffetts_recent_investment_strategies_and_tips | Warren Buffett]] recommends investing in companies where management holds many shares of the company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This aligns their interests with those of other shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Websites like Morningstar.com or MarketScreener.com allow investors to check management's stock holdings and salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Ideally, the value of their owned shares should be ten times higher than their salary, ensuring a positive long-term evolution for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## 7. Always Buy Shares Below Their Intrinsic Value
This is perhaps the most crucial advice: investors should always buy shares below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Intrinsic value is a subjective value calculated by the investor through a stock valuation process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

To value a business's shares, one must make a conservative estimate of its future benefits and then apply various valuation methods to arrive at the intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

*   **Coca-Cola Example**: The intrinsic value (blue line) versus the market price (red line) of Coca-Cola shares illustrates this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. When the market price was above the intrinsic value (e.g., 2003-2004), it was a poor time to invest, and shares subsequently fell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Conversely, when the price was below intrinsic value (e.g., 2009 or 2012), subsequent stock performance was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

Valuing shares is a simple process that requires learning, and resources are available to help investors deepen their understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

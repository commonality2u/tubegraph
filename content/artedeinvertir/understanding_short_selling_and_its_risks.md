Short selling is an investment strategy that allows investors to profit when the stock market or a particular stock declines in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. It is a distinctive approach to investing, differing from traditional long positions where an investor buys a stock hoping its price will increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:10">[02:28:10]</a>.

## How Short Selling Works
The mechanism of short selling involves a broker lending shares of a certain value to an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>. The investor then sells these borrowed shares in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>, with the expectation that their price will drop in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. If the price falls, the investor can buy the shares back at a lower level, make a profit from the difference, and return the shares to the broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. While it may seem complex in theory, in practice, initiating a short position involves clicking a "sell" button rather than a "buy" button <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## [[risks_and_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | Risks]] of Short Selling
Shorting a stock is considerably more dangerous than taking a long position (buying with the hope of an increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:00">[02:04:00]</a>. It is generally not recommended for beginner investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> due to two primary reasons:

### Limited Potential Profit, Unlimited Potential Loss
When shorting, your potential profit is limited to 100% (if the stock price drops to zero) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>. However, your potential loss is unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>, as a stock's price can theoretically multiply by hundreds or thousands of percent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>. In contrast, going long on stocks limits potential losses to the money invested, while potential gains are unlimited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:00">[02:32:00]</a>.

### Costs of Short Selling
There are additional costs associated with short selling:
*   **Dividends**: If the shorted stock pays dividends, the short seller must pay those dividends back to the party who lent them the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   **Interest**: The broker will charge annual interest for lending the shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

These factors mean that time works against the short seller; the longer it takes for the stock to drop, the higher the costs of maintaining the position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>.

## Notable Short Seller: Jim Chanos
Jim Chanos is a legendary investor known for generating annual returns over 20% through investments made against the market and individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He has consistently generated an annual return over 22% for more than 35 years for himself and his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. His investment funds have significantly outperformed the general [[stock_market_risks_and_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Chanos manages over $7 billion for clients, and his personal fortune is estimated at more than $1.5 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.

### Jim Chanos' Track Record of Successful Short Selling
Chanos has a remarkable track record of success in shorting stocks, often identifying significant frauds or overvalued companies:
*   **Wirecard (Germany)**: He was short on Wirecard shares months before the company announced its bankruptcy, reportedly making over $100 million from this operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. Wirecard was involved in one of the biggest stock frauds in Germany's history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00">[03:17:00]</a>.
*   **King Coffee (China)**: Chanos was short on King Coffee shares, which fell over 90% when fraud was uncovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
*   **Enron (USA)**: One of his most successful operations was the fall of Enron, the largest case of stock fraud in US history, from which he earned over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

### Jim Chanos' Current Bearish Market View
Chanos recently stated that the market offers one of the best bearish [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | opportunities]] of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. He cites two main reasons for his skepticism about the current market:
1.  **Profitability Concerns**: He is skeptical about stock profits in 2021 and would be surprised if they returned to 2019 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>. Chanos believes that long-term stock movements are driven by company profitability, implying that recent [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | market increases]] could be ephemeral if profits don't recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
2.  **New Debt Issuance**: He points to the new debt issuance by central banks worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>. Chanos argues that this "economic experiment" has primarily benefited the rich who own financial assets like stocks, while the majority of people have not benefited and will have to bear the cost of this new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a>. This could lead to new regulations or increased taxes, negatively impacting corporate profitability and, consequently, the future behavior of the [[economic_risks_and_investment_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:44:00">[04:44:00]</a>.

### Specific Stocks Shorted by Jim Chanos
Based on his bearish outlook, Chanos has focused his short investments on specific popular stocks:

#### Tesla (TSLA)
Tesla shares (TSLA), trading at $1,500 per share, represent one of Chanos' main short positions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>. His reasons for shorting Tesla include:
*   **Unprofitability and Debt**: Tesla is not a profitable company and carries a lot of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
*   **Increasing Competition**: The company faces rising competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **Aggressive Accounting**: Chanos claims Tesla manipulates its results through aggressive accounting practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:49:00">[05:49:00]</a>.
*   **Non-existent Technology**: He asserts that Tesla sells "autonomous driving technology that does not exist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:54:00">[05:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reliance on Tax Credits**: Excluding tax credits from governments, Tesla's accounts would show a negative result <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Stagnant Sales**: Tesla's sales had been stagnant for two years around 90,000 units per quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>, with sales of older models (Model S and X) falling sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Disclaimer regarding Tesla
> It is important to remember that Jim Chanos' assessment of Tesla is his opinion. Tesla is a leading company in the transition to electric cars but faces significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Due to its complexity, investors are advised to study such stocks thoroughly or refrain from investing if they don't fully understand the company's dynamics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

#### Uber (UBER)
Uber (UBER), trading at $30 per share, is another company Jim Chanos has shorted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>. His main concerns are:
*   **New Regulations**: Regulations aimed at preventing the company from exploiting low-cost labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a>.
*   **Low Profitability**: Despite significant sales growth over five years, Uber's losses have grown exponentially, reaching over $8 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>. The market assigns Uber a value of over $55 billion despite uncertainty about when it will generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>.

#### Food Delivery Companies
Chanos has also shorted shares of food delivery companies like Grubhub and Just Eat for similar reasons cited for Uber: new regulations and the low profitability of their business models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.

## Other Investment Analyses Discussed
The video also provides analyses of other companies, including some that Jim Chanos has bought (indicating he does not *only* perform short sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:00">[07:12:00]</a>:

They are not recommendations to buy or sell any particular stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>. Investors should only invest in what they understand, have analyzed, and have confidence in for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>.

### AstraZeneca (AZN) - Potential Long Opportunity
AstraZeneca (AZN), trading at $55 per share, is a company leading in finding solutions to current global health challenges, with a solution hoped to be ready by fall 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>. Their solution, in collaboration with Oxford University, is in Phase 3 trials, indicating an 80% success rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Market Leadership**: AstraZeneca is a world leader in oncology, cardiovascular, and respiratory medicines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:56:00">[08:56:00]</a>.
*   **Growth**: Thanks to recent discoveries, the company has transitioned from decline to growing at annual rates above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: In the first quarter, AstraZeneca grew over 15%, with profits exceeding $1 per share, annualizing to $4 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. A biotechnology company with growth like AstraZeneca should be listed at a Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of at least 25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>. At $4 earnings per share multiplied by a 25 P/E, the target price is $100 per share, offering a significant potential appreciation from its $55 current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>. Future projections estimate earnings of almost $7 per share in the next 3-5 years, potentially leading to a value over $150 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:11:00">[10:11:00]</a>.

### ETF (MPM) - Jim Chanos' Purchase
Jim Chanos has allocated 30% of his portfolio to the MPM ETF, which trades at $138 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>. This ETF consists of large-cap and high-quality companies such as Google, Amazon, Apple, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. Paradoxically, it also includes Tesla shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:00">[11:31:00]</a>, which Chanos has shorted individually. This ETF is estimated to provide a satisfactory return in the future, likely less than 15% per year due to the large size of its constituent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:00">[11:46:00]</a>.

### Virgin Galactic (SPCE) - Highly Speculative
Virgin Galactic (SPCE), trading at $22 per share, is Richard Branson's ambitious project to become the first space tourism company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:03:00">[12:03:00]</a>. Initially, it plans suborbital flights for a few minutes of weightlessness, with long-term ambitions for authentic space flights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
*   **High Price, No Income**: The company intends to charge over $250,000 for a limited suborbital experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:28:00">[12:28:00]</a>. Despite accepting reservations since 2004, it has no income and loses over $200 million per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:36:00">[12:36:00]</a>.
*   **Liquidity Concerns**: Virgin Galactic has about $400 million in liquidity but an annual cash outflow of $250 million, providing liquidity for only about a year and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. This means it frequently relies on issuing new shares to finance growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>, as traditional banks do not finance companies with no income and large losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00">[13:03:00]</a>.
*   **Share Dilution Risk**: If the share price drops significantly (e.g., to $5), the company would have to issue four times more shares to raise the same capital, leading to a 40% dilution that would be catastrophic for existing shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:29:00">[14:29:00]</a>.
*   **Highly Speculative**: Virgin Galactic is considered highly speculative because it constantly depends on issuing new shares, has high losses, and the profitability or safety of its future projects remains uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

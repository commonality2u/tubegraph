Quantitative Tightening (QT) is described as a new, dangerous risk for the stock market, with predictions of drops between 20% and 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. This policy is expected to make market conditions much more complicated starting in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.

## Understanding Quantitative Tightening (QT)

Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the opposite of Quantitative Easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Central banks, like the [[Federal Reserves impact on the economy | Federal Reserve]], have two primary tools: printing or withdrawing money from the system, and adjusting [[Impact of Interest Rate Changes on the Economy | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

During Quantitative Easing, money is printed and bonds are purchased, injecting liquidity into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>. Conversely, QT involves withdrawing printed money from the system, often done when economic conditions appear to be improving, to prepare for future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

## Effects on the Economy and Stock Market

The implementation of QT comes at a critical time, as it is being used to combat [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. The withdrawal of money from the system is closely related to [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

Starting in September, quantitative tightening will fully enter into effect, with a monthly withdrawal of $90-95 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Annually, this amounts to nearly a trillion dollars being removed from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This withdrawal of stimulus is not considered positive for the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.

Historically, periods of money withdrawal have coincided with poorer market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. For example, an initial withdrawal of money in 2018 led to a bear market due to a lack of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Small-cap stocks tend to suffer in scenarios of low liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

The [[Impact of quantitative tightening and financial policies on the stock market | Federal Reserve]] plans to reduce its balance sheet to previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:01">[01:02:01]</a>, which may lead to volatility and friction in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:06">[01:02:06]</a>.

## Interconnected Risks

Ray Dalio's Bridgewater company predicts a drop in [[Inflation and its impact on the economy | inflation]] but with an accompanying recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, and expects [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] to be more persistent than the market anticipates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This will significantly [[Impact of central bank policies on economic conditions | impact monetary policies]] and [[Federal Reserves impact on the economy | Fed rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

There are three major [[Impact of new risks on the economy and stock market | risks]] currently in the markets:
1.  **Pressure from Multiples**: The S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple has fallen from 24x to about 17x, nearing its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
2.  **Drop in Profits**: If corporate profits fall (typically 10-20% in a recession), this would artificially raise multiples and negatively [[Impact of new risks on the economy and stock market | affect stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. A recession is highly correlated with a drop in corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity in the System**: Easy and abundant money encourages investment and business confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. This is directly related to [[Impact of Interest Rate Changes on the Economy | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>, which the Fed has drastically changed course on by raising them faster and for longer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

Points 2 and 3 are closely correlated:
*   Rapid [[Impact of Interest Rate Changes on the Economy | rate hikes]] can cause a recession, leading to a drop in profits, which is negative for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   If the Fed avoids aggressive [[Impact of Interest Rate Changes on the Economy | rate hikes]] to prevent a recession, the [[Inflation and its implications on the economy | inflation]] problem may not be solved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

It is likely that at least two of these three [[Impact of new risks on the economy and stock market | risks]] will materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. For instance, if there is no drop in benefits, there will likely be significant withdrawal of liquidity or continued [[Impact of Interest Rate Changes on the Economy | rate hikes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. While the market may have priced in some of these risks, the full impact of a drop in corporate profits is not yet implicit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

The combination of rising [[Impact of Interest Rate Changes on the Economy | interest rates]] and QT creates a dual pressure point on the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Stock valuations are compared against ten-year bonds, so as rates rise, valuations must decrease to adjust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

## Investor Guidance

Ray Dalio and Bridgewater suggest that investors cannot completely escape the upcoming market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. They advise reducing risks, diversifying globally across asset classes (e.g., bonds, quality non-cyclical stocks with low debt), and diversifying sectorally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Sectors sensitive to the economic cycle, such as automotive, banking, insurance, construction, and transportation, tend to suffer during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>. Gold is not historically a safe haven in these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

Despite the current [[Macroeconomic indicators and their implications | macroeconomic indicators]] pointing to a difficult period, low valuations in some sectors, particularly in Europe, present opportunities for long-term investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Market corrections are often followed by rapid increases, making these periods interesting for taking advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:51">[00:21:51]</a>.

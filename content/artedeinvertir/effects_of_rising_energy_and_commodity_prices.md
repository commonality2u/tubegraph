The ongoing [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | conflict between Russia and Ukraine]] has significantly impacted global markets and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. The Russian stock market has experienced a collapse exceeding that of the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>, with its index falling 40% from its highs, a more severe drop than during the panic of March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Other stock markets are also down due to the escalating tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Impact on Energy Markets
The conflict has led to immediate responses, particularly in Europe. Germany suspended the certification of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, designed to bring Russian gas to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This action caused gas prices in Europe to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, which were already high due to supply issues and [[energy_crisis_and_its_effect_on_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

Oil prices have also soared, with crude oil reaching nearly $100 per barrel, compared to $50 a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Russia is a major global oil producer, contributing 10 million barrels per day, or 10% of global consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. Even a small supply gap of 2-4 million barrels could cause disproportionate price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. In 2008, oil prices jumped from $100 to $150 in a few weeks due to similar deficits and [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | inflationary pressures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. Sanctions preventing Russia from trading its oil would create a global bottleneck, further escalating prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. While oil-producing companies benefit, rising [[importance_of_energy_markets_and_inflation_on_global_finance | energy costs]] negatively impact the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

Natural gas in Europe is particularly problematic, with prices at 60-70 euros per megawatt, triple the price from a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. Although Germany assures a secure supply, the price is exceptionally high, posing a serious problem for European consumers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Gas exports from Russia to Europe were already at low levels in 2021 due to prior tensions, aggravating the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.

## Economic Consequences
Increased energy costs translate to less disposable income for consumers, which is critical as consumption drives 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Excluding Russia from the SWIFT system, limiting payments in euros, pounds, and dollars, would severely restrict trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. While Russia would be the primary victim, global trade obstacles negatively affect all, including Western companies that depend on sales in the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

## Impact on Agriculture and Food
The conflict also threatens the industry, agriculture, and food sectors. [[global_food_price_increases | Food prices]] were already rising due to [[rising_interest_rates_and_their_influence_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>, and this situation could worsen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Russia is a top grain and wheat producer, ranking fourth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Including Ukraine, the region accounts for nearly 20% of global production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Reduced supply due to conflict and sanctions could lead to disproportionate price increases for food commodities, often 50% to 100%, even if only 3-5% of demand is unmet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.

## Fertilizer Market
The fertilizer market is another critical area. Russia and Ukraine are major producers of potassium, a key component in fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Russia also accounts for almost 20% of Belarusian production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Fertilizer prices are already at very high levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, which ultimately contributes to higher food prices and [[rising_interest_rates_and_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This exacerbates stock market declines, as higher inflation is a major concern for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Stock Market Reactions and Investment Strategy
Historically, stock markets tend to fall *before* conflicts, experiencing anxiety due to uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. However, once negative events occur, markets often realize it's not "the end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The saying "buy with the drums of war and sell with the sound of the violin" suggests that buying during an invasion has historically yielded positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Major drops, like the Iraq invasion in 1990 (180 days to recover), or Pearl Harbor (less than a year), show that markets typically recover relatively quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### Investment Styles
During conflicts, [[investment_opportunities_in_raw_materials_and_commodities | investment styles]] show interesting trends:
*   **Small-cap stocks** typically see greater returns when bought during conflicts compared to their annual average, as assets become cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Large-cap stocks** also show slightly higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Safe investments (bonds)** yield *less* return during conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>, as money flows from stocks to bonds, making bonds more expensive and thus lowering their future yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.
*   [[rising_interest_rates_and_their_influence_on_investments | Good returns are made when there is fear]] or problems, as people are willing to sell shares at lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.

### Cyclical Stocks
Cyclical stocks, common in sectors like oil, gas, banking, and raw materials, are complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The best time to buy them is when their P/E valuation is highest, because that's when the price of raw materials or factors affecting their cyclicality is lowest, and results are about to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. These stocks are often seen as "good for renting, not for investing" in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.

#### Example Companies
*   **Gazprom (Russian gas and oil producer):** Despite rising gas and oil prices, Gazprom has seen significant declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. It trades at a P/E of 2.5, which is extremely low globally but closer to the Russian market average of 5x earnings due to geopolitical risk and lack of respect for private property <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>.
*   **Mosaic (Fertilizer sector):** As a potassium producer, Mosaic could benefit if sanctions limit Russian fertilizer supply, driving up prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:12">[00:22:12]</a>. The company has doubled its price in the last year due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. However, like many cyclical stocks, its long-term performance has been flat, demonstrating its volatile nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.
*   **Qiwi (Russian PayPal):** This company saw a pre-market fall of over 15% due to panic surrounding Russian shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. It trades at about 4 times expected profits for the next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>. Russian companies generally remunerate shareholders, offering high dividend yields <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:19">[00:27:19]</a>.
*   **Adobe (Technology):** Adobe saw a nearly 40% drop from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>. Despite solid fundamentals and a strong competitive advantage in software, it's impacted by market negativity towards tech stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>. The company is transitioning to a subscription-based cloud model, which has proven highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Data Group (Technology):** A technology company trading at 9-10 times EBITDA, lower than similar companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:36">[00:50:36]</a>. It has low debt and strong organic growth, with plans to significantly reduce CAPEX, leading to higher free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:13">[00:52:13]</a>.
*   **Green Landscaping:** This company announced a share buyback, indicating that management believes its shares are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. It trades at about 15 times earnings and is expanding its business model across the Nordic region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.
*   **Other high-growth tech stocks (e.g., Palantir, Shopify, Faith, Adobe, Data Group, Global, etc.):** Many of these have fallen by over 50-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:46">[00:35:46]</a>. While some were in a "gigantic bubble" with demanding valuations, the current market downturn is seen as a "cleanup" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy
In periods of market crisis and high volatility, being trained to navigate difficult periods is crucial for making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>. It is common for stock prices to fall for all companies in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>. A key strategy is "downward averaging," buying more shares as prices decline, to reduce the average cost and benefit from eventual recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:55">[00:34:55]</a>. However, this strategy is dangerous without fundamental knowledge, as some companies can go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

[[opportunities_and_risks_in_the_oil_market | Investors should be prepared]] to see their portfolios fall by 40-50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. Good stocks are often bought when there are macro fears, but the company's fundamentals remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. For example, the COVID-19 lockdown in 2020, while affecting some shares, was seen as transitory, allowing for good recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:02">[00:39:02]</a>.

The market's attachment to high-growth stocks is justified by their potential in expanding sectors like digital engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:44">[00:54:44]</a>. However, these stocks are more volatile, as investors with large profits tend to sell quickly at the first sign of correction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:54">[00:55:54]</a>. Investors must change their mentality; even highly successful companies like Apple have experienced multiple 50% drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:19">[00:56:19]</a>.

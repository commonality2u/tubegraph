[[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | Bill Gates]], one of the world's richest and most powerful individuals, appears to be preparing for a new crisis similar to past events, notably by investing heavily in companies that produce vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This represents a significant shift in his [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Approach and Past Role

[[bill_gates_role_in_pandemic_prediction_and_preparation | Bill Gates]] played a crucial role during the last crisis, having previously warned about the likelihood of a pandemic and the world's unpreparedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. His extensive knowledge of the biotechnology sector also enabled him to predict which company would be the first to develop a successful vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

Having built a fortune exceeding $100 billion from scratch, Bill Gates is renowned for co-founding Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Less known, however, are his excellent results in the investment field, where his movements and statements are closely watched by millions of investors due to his accurate vision of the future economy and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>.

## Transparency and Portfolio Shift

Due to stock market transparency rules in the United States, institutional investors managing over $100 million in assets must regularly report their stock purchases and sales to the American regulator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. This allows insight into Bill Gates' economic and stock market outlook, often more revealing than his public statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Bill Gates utilizes two primary [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | investment vehicles]]:
*   A fund for more traditional and safer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   The portfolio of the Billy and Melinda Gates Foundation, which is the focus of his new [[bill_gates_investment_strategies and decisions | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.

His [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | investment portfolio]] was recently made public, revealing a radical change in his strategy, seemingly in preparation for a crisis akin to 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. He has concentrated 70% of his investments into just three vaccine-producing stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Key Vaccine Stock Investments

The three stocks forming the core of his new strategy are BioNTech, CureVac, and Vir Bio Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. These companies are leading the development of "second-generation vaccines," which are expected to be more sophisticated and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Investing in biotechnology companies during their development phase can be highly risky and volatile, requiring a high level of knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. However, successful ventures can yield significant financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

### BioNTech (BNTX)

[[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_stocks_in_biotechnology | Bill Gates]] began investing in BioNTech (BNTX) at the end of 2019, six months before the start of the last crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>. His initial investment of $50 million is now valued at over $200 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. BioNTech, in collaboration with Pfizer, was the first company to launch an effective vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

While some believed vaccine demand would be a one-time event, BioNTech predicts a demand for one billion doses annually from 2022 onwards, indicating a potentially recurrent business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. For this year, the company is estimated to earn over $37 per share, trading at less than 10 times earnings, which is considered an attractive price for a biotechnology company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. If this business proves recurrent, shares could more than double in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

### CureVac (CVAC)

[[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_stocks_in_biotechnology | Bill Gates]] invested in CureVac (CVAC), another German company, in 2015 with a $50 million investment, now valued at over $230 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. CureVac is collaborating with large companies like GlaxoSmithKline on "second-generation vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. Unlike BioNTech, CureVac is still in the development phase, making the investment more speculative and volatile, as it is not yet profitable and depends heavily on the success of its clinical trials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>.

### Vir Bio Technology (VIR)

[[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_stocks_in_biotechnology | Bill Gates]] invested in Vir Bio Technology (VIR) in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This highly innovative company is developing an effective solution against multiple variants, including the Delta variant, with over 82% effectiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>. An additional factor that may have drawn Bill Gates' interest is the development of an inhaled vaccine solution, eliminating the need for injections and potentially increasing public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. Similar to CureVac, Vir Bio Technology is in the development phase, producing no current benefits, making it a highly speculative and risky, but potentially rewarding, investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

## The Rationale Behind the Strategy

In an interview with CNBC, [[bill_gates_investment_opportunities_bill_gates_is_optimistic_about | Bill Gates]] explained his significant interest in this sector: "We will only return to normal when we have not the first generation of vaccines, but the next generation of vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. He noted that many companies are working towards achieving this second generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>.

These statements, combined with his recent [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment portfolio]] movements, highlight the companies best positioned to develop these next-generation vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. As seen with companies like Moderna or BioNTech, while developing solutions that benefit humanity, these companies can also generate high returns for shareholders in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

Stanley Druckenmiller, recognized as one of the best investors of all time, is preparing his portfolio for a new economic and stock market scenario in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He has achieved positive returns in 100% of the years he has operated in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>, generating a 30% annual return for 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>. His approach combines macroeconomics study with stock investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Druckenmiller's current personal portfolio of shares is valued at over $3 billion, reflecting where he is investing his own money since he no longer manages third-party funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

## Key Premises for 2025

Druckenmiller operates on five key premises for the next 12 months and into 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>:

1.  **Euphoria in Tech Sector**: He identifies "euphoria in certain sectors in the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, particularly with companies related to Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>, where he sees danger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.
2.  **Fed Rate Cuts**: He anticipates the Federal Reserve will lower interest rates as the economy weakens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
3.  **Dollar Weakness**: The dollar is expected to decrease in value due to "enormous printing of money" and fiscal deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. He states, "I can't be bullish on the dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, noting its recent 5-6% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.
4.  **Persistent Inflation**: Inflation is expected to remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.

## Portfolio Repositioning: "The Great Rotation"

Druckenmiller is abandoning and selling shares in sectors where he foresees problems, repositioning his portfolio towards attractively valued sectors that he believes will perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This strategy is referred to as "the great rotation," where investors are shifting from large, technological companies to more undervalued, forgotten sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

### Selling Big Tech

*   He has reduced his position in NVIDIA by 87% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>, despite being an early investor who multiplied his money significant times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
*   He has also greatly reduced his position in Microsoft by 63% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>, selling over 700,000 shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.
*   He points to potential stock market bubbles characterized by a high number of frauds, where companies might "cook up the accounts" to meet expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

### New Investments

Druckenmiller is making significant new investments in sectors that align with his economic outlook. These investments expect to benefit from a weaker dollar, lower interest rates, and undervalued status.

#### 1. Japan and International Markets

He has been investing in Japan, believing it has high potential due to cheap stocks, changing policies, and increasing share buybacks and dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>. International stocks, particularly from Europe or Japan, and emerging countries tend to perform best when the dollar is weakening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>, as a weaker dollar relieves debt pressure on emerging economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

#### 2. U.S. Commodities and Industrial Sectors

Within the United States, he is investing in sectors related to commodities and industrials, which tend to perform well when the dollar depreciates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This depreciation benefits U.S. industrial companies that export, as repatriated profits in stronger currencies increase their earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.

#### Specific Company Investments:

*   **Kinder Morgan**: His fourth-largest investment is in this leading U.S. oil and gas pipeline company, with a $91 million investment from his personal funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   **Rationale**: Kinder Morgan is expected to benefit from inflation, a falling dollar, and lower Federal Reserve rates, which stimulate oil and gas consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. The stock has been trading at a discount, and its 6% dividend yield becomes more attractive as rates drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. The company benefits from limited new pipeline permits and increasing natural gas production and export from the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>.
*   **American Apartments (REIT)**: This real estate investment company is interesting due to a 30% drop from its peak, a high dividend payout, and its focus on luxury apartments in high-growth, lower-tax states like Texas and Florida <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.
    *   **Rationale**: Lower interest rates benefit real estate companies by reducing interest payments and increasing property values <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:16">[00:25:16]</a>. A weak dollar and inflation are also positives, as real estate assets protect against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. The company has low leverage (28% financed) and most debt is at a fixed, low rate (3.6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:17">[00:27:17]</a>. Profits are expected to return to growth from 2025 onwards after a slight dip in 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>.
*   **Woodward**: An industrial company that manufactures parts for aviation, expected to grow organically by 8-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:08">[00:30:08]</a>.
    *   **Rationale**: Aviation is a growing sector, and the company benefits from increasing demand for more advanced components in new aircraft models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>. Woodward expects to double in size by 2026, with an earnings per share growth of 14-18% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>. This growth rate is even higher than anticipated for some large technology companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:32">[00:32:32]</a>.
*   **Coherent**: Druckenmiller's largest position, a $260 million investment from his own pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. The company specializes in highly specialized industrial components like measuring lasers and thermal imaging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
    *   **Rationale**: Coherent expects very high growth in its served sectors (electronics, telecommunications, industrial), with an overall expected growth of more than 14-15% until 2028 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:11">[00:34:11]</a>. While current earnings have dropped, Druckenmiller follows the principle that "the present is not what moves the shares on the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:38">[00:34:38]</a>. He believes that periods of low earnings (when companies are not expanding capacity) are the best time to buy, anticipating future profit margin increases when capacity reduces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. The industrial sector, Coherent's customer base, is expected to recover and expand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:36">[00:38:36]</a>, benefiting from lower rates and normalization of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:59">[00:39:59]</a>.

## Druckenmiller's Investment Philosophy

Druckenmiller emphasizes looking 12 to 24 months into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:42">[00:36:42]</a>, rather than buying into current fads or euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. He advises against buying companies when their earnings are exceptionally good, as that often leads to overexpansion and future losses. Conversely, he suggests investing when companies are experiencing poor earnings, as this indicates a contraction in capacity that will lead to increased profit margins in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. This allows for buying stocks that are currently cheap but have strong future growth potential due to underlying factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>. This approach aims to achieve returns uncorrelated with overall market movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

This strategy showcases a clear shift from growth-at-any-price tech stocks to undervalued industrial and commodity-linked companies, anticipating a future market environment driven by changing monetary policy and macro trends.

## Net Asset Value (NAV)

The [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | net asset value]], or the net value of an [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | asset]], is a common valuation method for specific types of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:40">[00:22:40]</a>. This method is typically used when a company owns other easily valued [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | assets]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>, such as shares in other listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:01">[00:23:01]</a>.

### Calculation

To calculate the net [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | asset]] value:
1.  Add up the value of each individual part (or owned [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | assets]]) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>.
2.  Divide the total by the number of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>.

### Market Listing and Discounts

Companies valued by NAV are typically listed below their calculated [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | asset]] value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:26">[00:23:26]</a>. A common market discount applied is around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>. This discount accounts for the market's expectation that liquidating those shares would depress the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Sum of the Parts (SOTP) Valuation

The "sum of the parts" is a more sophisticated [[valuation_by_multiples | valuation by multiples]] method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Unlike NAV, which is for easily variable [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | assets]] like other shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:58">[00:23:58]</a>, SOTP is suitable for companies with diverse business lines <a class="yt=" yt-timestamp data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

### Application

This method is useful when a company has both highly profitable or "good" businesses and more "normal" or less profitable ones, meaning a single multiple cannot be applied to the entire company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:19">[00:24:19]</a>.

The process involves:
1.  Taking each business line separately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:27">[00:24:27]</a>.
2.  Applying a lower multiple to the less profitable or "worse" businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:29">[00:24:29]</a>.
3.  Applying a higher multiple to the "good" businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>.
4.  Summing the individual valuations of each part <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>.
5.  Dividing the total by the number of shares to arrive at the overall [[valuation_by_multiples | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:39">[00:24:39]</a>.

The individual [[valuation_by_multiples | valuation]] of each part can use methods such as Price-to-Earnings (P/E) or Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), but it is usually a multiple defined by the profits the business will produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:45">[00:24:45]</a>.

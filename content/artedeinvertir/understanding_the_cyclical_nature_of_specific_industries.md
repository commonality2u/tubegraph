The current market environment signals "the end of an era" of easy money, shifting the dynamics for various industries and requiring a nuanced approach to [[cyclical_stocks_and_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. While central banks previously supported the market through interventions like printing money, lowering rates, or government checks, making every correction an excellent buying opportunity, this paradigm has changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. The focus is now on tackling inflation, even if it leads to job losses and potential recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

## Cyclicality in the Semiconductor Industry: Micron Technology

Micron Technology, a manufacturer of RAM memories, operates in an industry that is both profitable and cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:17">[00:50:17]</a>. This [[cyclical_stocks_and_investment_strategies | cyclical nature]] arises from factors such as new factory openings by competitors like Samsung, which can increase supply and drive down RAM prices, impacting profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Despite the long-term trend of increasing demand for RAM due to technological advancements, the industry experiences significant price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:46">[00:50:46]</a>.

The stock price of Micron is closely correlated with RAM memory prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>. Investment in such companies is generally safer when RAM memory prices are in decline, as opposed to when they are at their highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:44">[00:53:44]</a>. This is because high fixed costs in manufacturing, coupled with variable RAM memory prices, result in a highly cyclical business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:08">[00:52:08]</a>. Profit margins for Micron have swung wildly, from 4% to 50% in good years, and collapsing in others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:38">[00:54:38]</a>.

Investors must differentiate between [[predictable_and_resilient_businesses | stable value companies]] and [[cyclical_stocks_and_investment_strategies | cyclical value companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:20">[00:55:20]</a>. While a stable company like Nike might rarely see an 80% drop, it can happen to Micron due to its cyclical business, creating both [[analysis_of_key_investments_and_market_conditions | opportunities]] and risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:37">[00:55:37]</a>. A common mistake for beginner investors is to buy cyclical stocks when their P/E ratios appear low (e.g., 8x earnings for Micron), without considering that these low multiples often occur when the company's profits are at their peak in the cycle, making the stock actually expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:51">[00:55:51]</a>.

## Cyclicality in the Energy Sector: Energy Transfer

Energy Transfer, a company involved in oil and gas pipelines, has a business model less affected by extreme price fluctuations of oil, as its revenue is primarily volume-based <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:20">[00:58:20]</a>. However, it is still susceptible to the broader [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | economic cycle]] and the financial health of its clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:28">[00:58:28]</a>.

Historically, in the 2014 oil bear market, the company had to cut its dividend due to high debt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:55">[00:58:55]</a>. A key risk for pipeline companies is debt and clients going bankrupt due to low commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>. However, with reduced debt and strong positioning in gas transportation and liquefaction, especially given global shifts away from Russian gas, Energy Transfer appears more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:01">[00:59:01]</a>.

## Retail Sector: Target and Costco

The retail sector serves as a "very good thermometer of how the American consumption is" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:42">[00:54:42]</a>. Recent declines in retail stocks like Target are primarily due to margin problems caused by increased transportation costs and inflationary pressures, rather than significant sales problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:36">[00:43:36]</a>. Target's stock dropped 45% in the 2018 crisis and 65% in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:47">[00:45:47]</a>.

Costco, however, exhibits a highly [[predictable_and_resilient_businesses | resilient business model]] even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:53">[01:09:53]</a>. Its ability to offer very cheap products makes it attractive during economic downturns, similar to McDonald's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. In the 2008 crisis, Costco's operating profits actually increased, with only a slight decrease in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:08">[01:11:08]</a>. Its stock fell by approximately 37% in 2008, a fall comparable to current market conditions, despite a fundamentally strong and expanding business model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:58">[01:11:58]</a>.

## Banking Sector: Citigroup and Bank of America

The banking sector is undergoing a process of consolidation, with fewer banks controlling a larger market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:22">[01:06:22]</a>. Initial interest rate hikes are generally positive for banks, but excessive pressure on consumers could be a concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:39">[01:06:39]</a>. Banks are valued based on their return on equity (ROE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:53">[01:06:53]</a>. For example, Citigroup has a lower ROE (7%) compared to Bank of America (11-12%), which affects their respective valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:57">[01:06:57]</a>. Higher ROE typically leads to higher valuation multiples based on book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:54">[01:07:54]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding the [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | impact of economic cycles]] on different industries is crucial. While some, like memory manufacturers, are highly cyclical, others, such as certain retail models or utility-like energy infrastructure, demonstrate greater resilience. [[Analysis of specific stocks and sectors | Analyzing specific stocks]] requires differentiating between temporary and permanent problems, assessing debt levels, and understanding the unique characteristics of each business model to identify [[analysis_of_key_investments_and_market_conditions | investment opportunities]] in volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:29">[01:04:29]</a>.

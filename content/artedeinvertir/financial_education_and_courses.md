The speaker notes the significant and unexpected public interest in [[discussion_on_the_importance_of_financial_education_and_investment_training | investing]] and [[investment_education_and_strategies | learning about finance]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This growing interest underscores the importance of quality [[investment_education_and_strategies | investment education]] and [[investment_training_and_courses | training]].

## The Speaker's Background and Philosophy
The speaker began his career as an outsider to the financial industry, with no prior contacts or experience, having studied engineering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>. He developed his expertise as a hobbyist, undergoing self-training through online courses on company valuation and accounting, as comprehensive courses like his own were not available at the time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:50">[01:52:50]</a>. His personal success led to the co-founding of an investment fund in 2014, which has grown to manage 120 million euros across three funds for 8,000 clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:31">[01:53:31]</a>.

His educational philosophy revolves around "teaching you how to fish" rather than merely providing stock recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:32">[06:29:32]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of understanding how to approach [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]], find information, and use relevant websites to value businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:39">[06:36:39]</a>.

## Investment Training and Courses Offered
The speaker offers a structured [[investment_training_and_courses | course]] designed to impart his accumulated knowledge from almost 10 years of experience, transitioning individuals from hobby investors to potentially managing funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:07">[02:20:07]</a>.

### Course Details
*   **Format**: The [[investment_training_and_courses | course]] is taught personally by the speaker through live webinars, beginning March 8th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:01">[02:01:01]</a>.
*   **Content**: It condenses significant [[investing_in_knowledge_through_books_and_resources | knowledge]] to teach students how to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:10">[02:10:10]</a>.
*   **Investment Club**: An integral part of the [[investment_training_and_courses | course]] is an [[tools_and_training_for_private_investors | investment club]], which simulates a real portfolio process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:46">[02:37:46]</a>. This club offers:
    *   Detailed investment cases for interesting stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:19">[02:45:19]</a>.
    *   Ongoing follow-up on these investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:15">[02:49:15]</a>.
    *   Webinars allowing students to ask questions and interact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:34">[02:51:34]</a>.
    *   A 12-month observation period to understand the real investment process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:15">[03:04:15]</a>.
    *   The methodology has been effective for over four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:09">[03:11:09]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that this [[educational_opportunities_for_private_investors | educational opportunity]] is optional, and a significant amount of [[investment_education_and_strategies | knowledge]] can still be gained from his YouTube channel and recommended books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:39">[03:31:39]</a>. He also recommends a more official channel for in-depth analysis of companies like Nagarro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:48">[03:35:48]</a>.

## Principles for Successful Investing
The speaker offers several key principles for private investors, particularly those just starting out:

*   **Focus on What Works**: Investors don't need to predict every stock's movement; instead, focus on a diversified portfolio of companies with good prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
*   **Diversification**: It's crucial to have a balanced portfolio, ideally of 15-30 companies, especially 20-25 when starting, rather than concentrating all investments in a few "fashionable" stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This helps mitigate risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View and Discipline**: Recognize that market volatility is normal and to be expected (e.g., 10% falls every 12 months, 20% falls every 5 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. Don't overreact to market drops; instead, view them as opportunities to buy quality stocks at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:24">[01:19:24]</a>.
*   **Avoid Euphoria and Speculation**: While both [[financial_market_analysis_and_predictions | investing]] and speculating can be profitable, it's vital to understand the difference and not confuse them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:01">[01:40:01]</a>. Beware of excessive market euphoria, especially in highly valued companies without profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:42">[01:47:42]</a>.
*   **Start Small, Build Confidence**: Begin with small, successful operations to build confidence and reinforce that [[personal_finance_and_saving_strategies | investing]] is a valid way to generate wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:47">[01:16:47]</a>.
*   **Rationality Over Emotion**: Success in the stock market requires common sense, rationality, and controlling emotions, especially the desire to get rich overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:33">[01:53:33]</a>.
*   **In-depth Understanding**: Truly understanding a business means having a clear vision of its future sales and profits, not just knowing what it sells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:17">[01:34:17]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Compounding**: The power of [[the_importance_of_economic_discipline_and_compound_interest | compound interest]] makes a 3-5 year outlook crucial for assessing potential returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
*   **Market Monitoring Tools**: Tools like TKR and the JP Morgan Market Guide are valuable for analyzing market data and understanding valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.
*   **Liquidity**: Keeping some liquidity (e.g., 10-20% of funds) allows for buying opportunities during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:27">[01:28:27]</a>.

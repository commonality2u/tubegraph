The current conflict in Ukraine has entered a new phase, which is an [[economic and trade sanctions on Russia | economic war]] that is expected to affect everyone globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Financial ministers have warned that the series of measures being taken by countries will be very significant for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Economic Measures Against Russia

One of the key measures being implemented is the exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>.

### Understanding SWIFT

SWIFT (Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication) is a system designed to facilitate international money transfers and trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Excluding Russia from this system means essentially blocking their ability to conduct international financial transactions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.

### Implementation of SWIFT Sanctions

The United States, Canada, and other countries have already taken initial steps to exclude Russia from SWIFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. The United Kingdom, for example, has also encouraged the United States to adopt similar measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>, and is selectively excluding certain Russian banks from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

### Consequences for Russia

Beyond SWIFT, other [[economic and trade sanctions on Russia | economic measures]] include:
*   **Banning Russian companies from capital markets**: The UK has banned Russia and its companies from UK capital markets, which were a primary source of financing for Russian firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This could severely limit the issuance of new debt or shares for Russian companies listed on Western markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The sale of Russian sovereign debt in markets like London will also be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.
*   **Targeting the Russian oligarchy**: Western countries are severely restricting the movements and financial activities of Russian oligarchs who control key sectors like oil, gas, banking, and transportation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>. These individuals historically support the Putin regime financially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. The goal is to apply significant economic pressure on these oligarchs to impact the Putin regime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Limiting Russian citizen funds in foreign banks**: Russian citizens are restricted to having a maximum of $66,000 in foreign banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
*   **Banning high-tech equipment exports**: All exports of high-technology equipment to Russia are banned, affecting companies like ARM and Intel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

### Consequences for Europe and the US

The German finance minister has explicitly warned that excluding Russia from the SWIFT system would have "serious economic consequences" for Germany and the rest of Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, and consequently for the US as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>. This measure is not to be taken lightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, as it would have a "massive impact on German businesses" and, by extension, on the German and European stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

## Broader Economic and Market Impacts

The [[impacts of Ukraine Invasion on Global Economy | Ukraine conflict]] is leading to significant economic consequences:
*   **Rising energy prices**: A tremendous rise in oil and gas prices is seen as the main factor with the most weight in the current situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This exacerbates existing inflationary pressures that were already causing stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Historically, rising oil prices have been closely linked to economic recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Inflation and purchasing power**: The inflation caused by rising oil and gas prices is eroding the purchasing power of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:02">[01:20:02]</a>.
*   **Impact on stock markets**: Companies with significant exposure to Russia (e.g., Coca-Cola bottler, Carlsberg, Inditex, Renault, Philip Morris) could see a large percentage of their sales evaporate if excluded from SWIFT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:59">[01:33:59]</a>. Due to operating leverage, a 10% drop in sales can lead to 30-60% drops in profits, which the stock market will reflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>.
*   **Volatility**: The [[impact of the Ukraine conflict on the financial markets | situation]] can lead to significant market volatility in the short and medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>. While war conflicts have historically had a null to medium-term effect on markets, short-term drops of 10-20% are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:03:06">[02:03:06]</a>.
*   **Opportunities**: Periods of pessimism, when "bears" outweigh "bulls," are often the best times to invest, as stocks are cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Specific company impacts**:
    *   **Luxury brands (e.g., Ferrari, Louis Vuitton)**: Have dropped significantly due to their proximity to the conflict and exposure to the Russian market (5-10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:29">[00:45:29]</a>. Louis Vuitton also has significant exposure to the Chinese market (25-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:58">[00:46:58]</a>.
    *   **Visa/Mastercard**: While international money transfers are facilitated by SWIFT, the impact on these global consumer product companies is not as significant as one might think, as their Russian sales are not very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:11">[00:48:11]</a>.
    *   **EPAM Systems**: A company with engineers in Eastern European countries, including Ukraine, saw its shares plummet due to war fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:40">[00:53:40]</a>. While affected, they can relocate workers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:46">[00:54:46]</a>.
    *   **Wizz Air**: An airline similar to Ryanair operating in Eastern Europe, saw its stock plummet due to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:47">[01:18:47]</a>.

Diplomatic channels have failed, leading to the use of economic channels. The hope is that these measures will work to resolve the conflict and prevent further escalation into a wider war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.

The "Great Economic Reset" proposes a major reform: the [[technological_innovation_and_disruptive_companies | Fourth Industrial Revolution]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. This initiative aims to promote everything related to new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Promotion and Implementation
The World Economic Forum's Davos forum dedicates an entire day to educating attendees about this new technological revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>. These measures are already being implemented:
*   The European Union's official website shows that a significant portion of aid, over 140 billion euros, is earmarked for innovation and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.
*   Governments and companies will be compelled to allocate this financial injection towards new technological projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

## Benefiting Sectors and Companies
This focus on technology has significantly benefited sectors like the Nasdaq and technology stocks, making them some of the best-performing areas in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

Some of the most impacted companies include:
*   **Large American Technology Companies:** Firms like Facebook, Google, and Amazon, despite recent growth, are still considered reasonably valued given their high profits and future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Their international tax declarations also make them less vulnerable to potential domestic tax increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities
The video highlights specific [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investment opportunities]] within the technology sector:

### Qualcomm (QCOM)
Qualcomm, listed under the ticker QCOM at $160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>, is a leading technology company known for its high-quality products and dominant market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.
*   **Core Business:** A leader in manufacturing microchips and processors, primarily for the smartphone segment, with its notable Snapdragon processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Patents:** Holds over 140,000 patents worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **5G Technology:** The "Great Economic Reset" aims to promote 5G technology, positioning Qualcomm favorably to leverage this new phase of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Royalties:** Generates significant income through royalties by licensing its patents to other companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Expected to produce around $9 billion in free cash flow, placing its current valuation at approximately 20 times earnings, which is below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **Growth Potential:** With moderate growth of 10% per year and trading at 25 times earnings, its target value could reach over $250 in the next 3-5 years, offering interesting potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### Equinix (EQIX)
Equinix, listed under the ticker EQIX at $770 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>.
*   **Tax Advantage:** As a REIT, it benefits from a special U.S. tax regime where it avoids corporate taxes by distributing the majority of its profits as dividends to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. This means it would not be negatively affected by tax increases on traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.
*   **Market Niche:** Equinix specializes in building and renting data centers that house large processors for storing and processing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
*   **Clientele:** Many of its clients are major technology companies like Google, Microsoft, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.
*   **Benefiting from Revolution:** The company is poised to benefit significantly from the [[technological_innovation_and_disruptive_companies | Fourth Industrial Revolution]] as the amount of data processed and transported via the internet is expected to increase exponentially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Equinix provides the essential infrastructure for this growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.
*   **Financial Performance:** Its Adjusted Funds From Operations (AFFO), a measure of profit for REITs, tripled from $700 million in 2014 to $2.1 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Valuation & Growth:** Currently trading at a demanding valuation of around 30 times earnings, this is justified by the high predictability of its business and practically assured growth in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. With an expected growth of at least 15%, its value could reach $1,400 in a three to five-year outlook, representing a significant potential for realization compared to its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

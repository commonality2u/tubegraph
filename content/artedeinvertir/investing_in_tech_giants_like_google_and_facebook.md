Michael Burry, known for his macroeconomic bets, has made significant [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investments]] in the shares of Facebook and Google, despite generally being bearish on many [[investment_opportunities_in_highgrowth_stocks | high-growth technology stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. These two companies represent a massive bullish bet in his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Investment Strategy
Burry has structured his portfolio to benefit from assets that will go up during periods of high inflation, as well as from those that will go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. His approach often involves creating "asymmetrical" investments where the potential loss is small, but the potential gain is very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a>. For Google and Facebook, he has used call options to leverage his position and potentially multiply his profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:41">[00:32:41]</a>. For example, if he invests $100 in shares and they rise 50% for a 50% gain, with call options, he could potentially multiply his profit by three or four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:55">[00:32:55]</a>.

## Performance and Operating Leverage
Both Google and Facebook have demonstrated strong performance, partly due to a phenomenon called "operating leverage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:03">[00:34:03]</a>. This means they are increasing sales while their costs remain almost the same, allowing profits to grow much more significantly than revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:08">[00:34:08]</a>.

### Google's Performance
Google's income in the first three months of the year rose from $41 billion to $55 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a>. Its marketing and advertising costs have remained nearly constant year-on-year, while administrative costs have even decreased, leading to a disproportionate impact on profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. Profits surged from $7 billion to $21 billion, with earnings per share jumping from $10 to over $26 per quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:42">[00:34:42]</a>.

Google's segments, including Google Search and YouTube, have grown by 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:19">[00:35:19]</a>. The cloud computing segment has also grown by approximately 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>. The company continues to steal market share from traditional media, a process accelerated by the recent crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.

### Facebook's Performance
Facebook's earnings per share have nearly doubled, from $1.70 to $3.30, due to costs increasing much less than income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:11">[00:36:11]</a>. Costs increased by 25% while income grew by 46%, causing total profits to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:24">[00:36:24]</a>. The average revenue per user has increased from $7 to $9, indicating both higher prices and more customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>.

## Valuation and Future Outlook
Despite their growth, these companies are considered to have "cheap multiples" compared to some other tech companies trading at 100x, 200x, or 500x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:01">[00:36:01]</a>.

### Google's Potential Valuation
*   **2021 Earnings:** Expected to earn around $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:27">[00:37:27]</a>.
*   **2023 Earnings:** Estimated to earn between $120 and $140 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>.
*   **Target Price:** With reasonable valuation multiples of 25 to 30 times earnings, Google's share price could reach $3,500 to $4,500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:48">[00:37:48]</a>.

### Facebook's Potential Valuation
*   **2021 Earnings:** Expected to earn around $13 to $15 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:39">[00:38:39]</a>.
*   **2023 Earnings:** Expected to earn around $18 to $22 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:52">[00:38:52]</a>.
*   **Target Price:** At 25 to 30 times earnings, valuations could range from $500 to $700 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.

## Resilience to Inflation
Unlike companies whose value is heavily tied to bond yields, Google and Facebook are expected to be less affected by inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:05">[00:38:05]</a>. They can raise the price of ads, and while employee wages may increase, their fundamental business model is robust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:09">[00:43:09]</a>.

## Contrasting with Speculative Assets
The speaker contrasts these tech giants with more speculative assets, such as "meme stocks" (like GameStop or AMC), cloud software, disruptive tech companies, and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:44">[00:43:44]</a>. These speculative assets are prone to "bubble behaviors" and significant volatility, unlike established companies like Google and Facebook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:44">[00:46:44]</a>.

It's essential to make informed decisions and avoid being "tourists of the stock market" who are swayed by promises of high benefits without proper research <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:31">[00:44:31]</a>.

This article explores the recent movements and investment philosophies of several prominent investors, including Michael Burry, [[Ray Dalio's investment advice and portfolio strategies | Ray Dalio]], [[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett]], Andrew Brenton, Bill Ackman, Li Lu, and Robert Vinall, based on recent market activities and public statements. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>

## Michael Burry's Market Outlook and Portfolio Shifts

Michael Burry recently sold almost all of his shares, reducing his portfolio from $160 million to approximately $3 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:25">[02:24:25]</a> The remaining position is in GEO Group, which he considers "testimonial" as it only represents $3 million of his total assets. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:29">[02:29:29]</a> GEO Group is a REIT undergoing restructuring, facing regulatory changes concerning private prisons in the U.S., though sentiment is shifting. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:38">[02:38:38]</a>

Burry explained his moves by stating that the market rally from June 1st to August 10th was falsely attributed to quantitative tightening (withdrawal of money by the central bank). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> He points out that during this period, the Fed was actually buying more mortgage debt, which is akin to injecting money into the system. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:29">[03:29:29]</a> He anticipates that the "really complicated thing" will begin in September when the actual quantitative tightening (QT) starts, involving a withdrawal of $95 billion in stimuli per month, potentially alongside additional interest rate hikes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:41">[03:41:41]</a>

Burry also noted that the market rebound, such as Nasdaq's 20% bounce from its lows or S&P 500's 15-17% rebound, should not instill confidence. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a> He feels the current situation is very similar to the 2000-2001 crisis, an asset bubble. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:20:20">[04:20:20]</a> Other investors like Druckenmiller have highlighted that historical asset bubbles (e.g., crypto, unprofitable IPOs, tech companies in 2021) typically don't end with a short six-month bear market, but rather last for years to "clean up the entire system" and clear out "weak hands." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:30">[04:30:30]</a>

The recent market increases are partly linked to a large short covering event, where investors betting against the market closed their positions to avoid losses, causing a rebound. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:59">[05:59:59]</a> This short covering has reached peaks not seen since 2021, with similar peaks in 2015 and 2016 also causing strong market rebounds. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:08">[06:08:08]</a>

## [[Ray Dalio's investment advice and portfolio strategies | Ray Dalio]]'s Investment Shifts

[[Ray Dalio's investment advice and portfolio strategies | Ray Dalio]] has recently sold all of his Chinese stocks, leaving none in his portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:41">[06:41:41]</a> He had been quite negative about the macro issues and control in China. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:48">[06:48:48]</a> His sales include Alibaba and JD, popular Chinese companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:00:00">[07:00:00]</a> This divestment from Chinese exposure suggests caution, especially given recent bad news like the real estate bubble. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:12:12">[07:12:12]</a>

Interestingly, Dalio seems more positive on Europe, having closed most of his $10 billion bet against European stocks, reducing his short position to only $800 million. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:28:28">[07:28:28]</a> He has, however, maintained short positions in Banco Santander. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:50">[07:50:50]</a>

His top purchases during the quarter include CVS, Mastercard, Google (Alphabet), and Meta (Facebook). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:11">[08:11:11]</a> These are considered high-quality companies, and Dalio bought them after they had dropped significantly by June 30th. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:17">[08:17:17]</a> His top sales include Alibaba, JD, and ETFs focused on emerging countries, indicating a cautious stance on emerging markets due to their cyclical, less stable economies, and reliance on primary sectors and raw materials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:49">[08:49:49]</a> Instead, he has bought S&P 500 equity shares, which are theoretically more stable in complicated macroeconomic environments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:36:36">[09:36:36]</a>

### CVS Health (CVS)
CVS is a stable company with two main businesses: offering health plans in the U.S. and running pharmacies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:06">[10:06:06]</a> These healthcare companies, especially health insurance and pharmacies, are super resistant to crises. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:29:29">[10:29:29]</a> CVS also has low debt, which is beneficial during a crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:34:34">[10:34:34]</a> This illustrates that large investors don't necessarily sell everything during a crisis; instead, they rotate into safer assets that can perform reasonably well even without a crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:38">[10:38:38]</a>

CVS reported moderate but stable sales growth of 5-7% in its Q3 results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:17:17">[11:17:17]</a> It's a large, mature company with a capitalization of over $50 billion and has increased its profit forecast for 2022 to $8.48-$8.60 per share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:24:24">[11:24:24]</a> This places its trading multiple at about 12 times earnings, significantly below the sector average or the S&P 500 (17-18 times earnings). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:37">[11:37:37]</a> Its valuation, considering debt, is currently at 9.9 times, which is in line with its historical average of 9 times over the last decade. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:51">[11:51:51]</a>

## [[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s Investment Strategies and Holdings

[[Warren Buffett's investment strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s Berkshire Hathaway has been actively investing, notably increasing its holdings in Ally Financial. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:40:40">[12:40:40]</a> Ally, initially focused on auto financing, has diversified into other sectors and trades at a low multiple of 6-7 times earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:56">[12:56:56]</a> This reflects Buffett's strategy of buying companies not necessarily growing, but trading at very low multiples, especially when the market average is higher. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:07">[13:07:07]</a> Many of these companies also return money to shareholders, which is favored in an inflationary environment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:21">[13:21:21]</a>

Buffett has also been accumulating Occidental Petroleum shares and buying Markel shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:34">[13:34:34]</a> Markel is described as a "mini-Berkshire Hathaway," having private businesses that generate significant cash flow used to buy public shares and private companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:40:40">[13:40:40]</a> Markel trades at reasonable multiples of price-to-book value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:01">[14:01:01]</a>

A notable addition to Buffett's portfolio is the Activision Blizzard arbitrage. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:08">[14:08:08]</a> This is a special situation where the investment's success is decorrelated from broader market movements. The theory is that Microsoft's acquisition of Activision should be approved by Q4 2022, offering a 15-20% upside regardless of S&P 500 performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:11:11">[14:11:11]</a> Buffett has engaged in such arbitrage in the past, for instance, with the Red Hat merger. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:46">[14:46:46]</a>

On the selling side, Buffett completely sold his Verizon shares and reduced holdings in General Motors and other more cyclical or lower-quality companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:20:20">[15:20:20]</a>

### Celanese (CE)
Buffett has invested in Celanese, a specialized chemical company. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:55">[15:55:55]</a> This business has become attractive because strict environmental regulations make it difficult to build new chemical plants, limiting supply while demand for chemical derivatives remains constant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:22:22">[18:22:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:02">[19:02:02]</a>

Celanese is a company with very low sales growth (around 2% annually) but trades at a cheap valuation (6-8 times earnings). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:10:10">[16:10:10]</a> It treats shareholders well by returning all its earnings through significant share buybacks, which has drastically reduced its share count (from 150 million to 108 million shares). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:36">[16:36:36]</a> This practice has led to a multiplication of earnings per share (from $4 to $18), turning it into a "growth company" at the earnings level despite low sales growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:52:52">[16:52:52]</a> The company also pays dividends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:19:19">[17:19:19]</a>

Celanese recently reported stable sales growth and increased its profit forecast for the year, expecting to earn around $16 annually per share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:43:43">[19:43:43]</a> This puts its current trading multiple at approximately 6 times earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:46:46">[19:46:46]</a> While current margins (29-30%) are higher than usual due to demand and bottlenecks, normalized earnings are expected to be around $15 per share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:25:25">[20:25:25]</a> If the company remains aggressive with share buybacks at its low valuation, it could still achieve 15% annual profit growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:07:07">[21:07:07]</a>

The stock has corrected strongly, falling from $170, which Buffett has taken advantage of, adhering to the principle of buying good companies at cheap prices during falls. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:58:58">[17:58:58]</a> While chemical businesses can see profits drop during crises due to high fixed costs, their ability to release working capital during downturns can provide a cash flow buffer, insulating them from debt problems. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:00:00">[22:00:00]</a>

## Other Notable Investors and Their Approaches

### Andrew Brenton (Turtle Creek)
Andrew Brenton, co-founder of Turtle Creek Asset Management, has a successful track record with net returns of 22% per year over 24 years, surpassing even Bill Ackman and matching the legendary performance of [[Warren Buffett's investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] and Munger. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:51:51">[23:51:51]</a> His investment philosophy is highly replicable for small investors, focusing on a small number of well-controlled, high-quality stocks with good track records, strong management, and cash flow. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:44:44">[24:44:44]</a>

His recent purchases include Brunswick (recreational boats), Colliers (real estate services), and CarMax (used cars). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:27:27">[25:27:27]</a> He reduced holdings in more cyclical or debt-sensitive companies like PRA Group (loan recovery) and SCI (funeral services). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:57:57">[26:57:57]</a> His main positions include Barry Global, TFI International (formerly TransForce), and Medifast. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:25:25">[27:25:25]</a> Barry Global is considered cheap due to negative sentiment around medium and small companies, but it treats shareholders well through buybacks and debt reduction, trading at around 7 times earnings. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:36:36">[27:36:36]</a>

### TFI International (formerly TransForce)
TFI International is a Canadian road transport company that has multiplied its stock market value by 50 times in two decades. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:04:04">[28:04:04]</a> The founder holds a significant number of shares, aligning management interests with shareholders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:37:37">[28:37:37]</a> It has consistently grown sales, EBITDA, and earnings per share by 15% annually, providing a 15% annual stock return plus an additional 1-2% in dividends. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:56:56">[28:56:56]</a>

The business is cyclical but resilient; during the 2008 crisis, while revenue dropped, EBITDA margins behaved well due to a variable cost structure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:12:12">[29:12:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:13:13">[36:13:13]</a> A unique aspect is its ability to generate more cash flow during crises by freeing up working capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:44:44">[29:44:44]</a> TFI has four segments: parcel delivery, less-than-truckload (LTL), truckload (TL), and logistics. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:05">[30:05:05]</a> Parcel delivery is growing due to e-commerce, and the logistics segment (acting as an intermediary) is highly lucrative due to its asset-light nature and high cash flow margins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:20:20">[30:20:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:33">[34:33:33]</a>

TFI's growth strategy involves acquiring smaller, worse-managed companies in the fragmented transport sector, integrating them into their efficient system, and improving their low profit margins. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:12:12">[32:12:12]</a> This allows them to significantly boost profits and achieve high returns on invested capital. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:37:37">[32:37:37]</a> During the 2020 crisis, TFI was aggressive with acquisitions, leveraging its low debt and financial muscle to buy companies at cheap prices, nearly tripling its earnings per share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:14:14">[37:14:14]</a> The market currently values TFI at a low multiple compared to its historical average and the broader market, despite its quality and growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:56:56">[38:56:56]</a>

### Bill Ackman (Pershing Square)
Bill Ackman's recent notable move was selling all of his Netflix shares. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:55:55">[40:55:55]</a> His concentrated portfolio includes positions in Chipotle, Hilton, Howard Hughes, and Domino's Pizza. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:01:01">[41:01:01]</a> Domino's Pizza is highlighted as a high-quality company that recently dropped in price, offering an opportunity at 20 times earnings, a rare valuation for the best pizza company due to its management, growth, and technology. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:20:20">[41:20:20]</a>

A unique [[Investment strategies and philosophies | investment strategy]] by Ackman is the Pershing Square Holdings (PSH), a listed version of his hedge fund on the Amsterdam Stock Exchange. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:56:56">[41:56:56]</a> PSH mirrors the performance of his private fund, including exotic derivatives. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:19:19">[42:19:19]</a> PSH has delivered strong returns, outperforming the S&P 500 and other indices over the past five years (23% annualized return). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:30:30">[42:30:30]</a>

A key characteristic of PSH is that it often trades at a significant discount to its Net Asset Value (NAV). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:35:35">[43:35:35]</a> For instance, if the NAV is $48, the stock might trade at $32. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:40:40">[43:40:40]</a> Ackman exploits this by using fund money to buy back PSH shares below their intrinsic value, thereby increasing the NAV per share and generating shareholder value even without an increase in the underlying portfolio's value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:01:01">[44:01:01]</a> Between 2017 and 2020, $1 billion worth of shares were bought back, reducing total shares by 20%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:28:28">[44:28:28]</a> The discount to NAV has reached extreme levels, even 50% recently, meaning an investor could buy the fund at effectively half its asset value. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:21:21">[45:21:21]</a>

### Li Lu (Charlie Munger's delegated manager)
Li Lu, often called "[[Warren Buffett's successor]]" and the only person to whom Charlie Munger has delegated capital management, has made significant moves. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:44:44">[46:44:44]</a> His most interesting move was buying a substantial amount of Alphabet (Google) shares, which now constitute 25% of his portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:14:14">[47:14:14]</a> Google is seen as a high-quality company with a significant competitive advantage, growing at 15% annually, yet trading at a market average multiple. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:28:28">[47:28:28]</a>

Other top holdings include Apple, Bank of America (a more cyclical business that has lowered its valuation), and Micron. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:48:48">[47:48:48]</a>

### Micron Technology (MU)
Micron is a cyclical business in the chip sector, specifically manufacturing RAM and flash memory. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:40:40">[49:40:40]</a> The sector has consolidated significantly (dominated by Micron, Samsung, SK Hynix, and Toshiba), bringing some discipline. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:01:01">[50:01:01]</a> However, it remains a business with high fixed costs (expensive factories and maintenance), leading to highly variable profit margins (EBIT margins can range from 0% to almost 50%). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:20">[50:20:20]</a>

Micron's stock recently collapsed due to a slowdown in the chip industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:40:40">[48:40:40]</a> After a period of chip shortage and over-ordering, clients now have excess inventory, and the economy is slowing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:09:09">[49:09:09]</a> This quarter, sales were 20% below expectations, and estimated profits were significantly missed. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="49:20:20">[49:20:20]</a> This volatility in earnings (e.g., $5 to $12 to $3 per share) makes it a "carousel" stock. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:50:50">[51:50:50]</a>

### Robert Vinall
Robert Vinall, another favorite investor in the community, employs a concentrated portfolio (around 10 shares) focused on quality businesses with predictable growth and results. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:12:12">[52:12:12]</a> His American holdings include Credit Acceptance and Facebook (Meta). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:57:57">[52:57:57]</a> Credit Acceptance, specializing in subprime auto loans, has multiplied by over 50 times on the stock market and can even increase profits during a crisis, acting countercyclically. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:16:16">[53:16:16]</a>

However, Vinall's fund has seen a 40% drop this year due to holdings in high-valuation, unprofitable "new economy" technology companies like Wix, Carvana, and Truebill. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:52:52">[53:52:52]</a> These companies, which previously financed themselves by issuing billions of shares, now face a "dead end" as market confidence wanes and they struggle to make their business models profitable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:05:05">[54:05:05]</a> This contrasts with "good businesses" where time runs in the investor's favor. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:21:21">[54:21:21]</a> Starting from very high valuations (multiples of sales rather than profits), many of these stocks have collapsed 70-90%. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:32:32">[54:32:32]</a>

## General Investment Principles and Takeaways

*   **Due Diligence**: Investors must know what they are investing in, rather than blindly copying others. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:50">[01:00:50]</a>
*   **Risk Awareness**: Investing in the stock market carries risk and is not a game; it must be taken seriously. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:33">[01:33:33]</a>
*   **Chinese Stocks**: Investing in Chinese stocks requires extreme caution. Success often comes from companies that return money to shareholders via buybacks and dividends, or hyper-growth companies that become extremely cheap. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a> Companies that neither grow significantly nor return capital can be penalized for a long time. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>
*   **Business Model Understanding**: It's crucial to understand a company's business model, including how it generates cash flow and its sensitivity to economic cycles. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:54">[02:54:54]</a>
*   **Valuation vs. Quality**: The market sometimes offers the same low valuation for high-quality, well-managed companies as for poor-quality ones, creating paradoxes that educated investors can exploit. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>
*   **Temporary Situations**: Special situations like spin-offs or mispricings (e.g., Pershing Square Holdings trading below NAV) can present opportunities, but require deep understanding. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:12">[01:00:12]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:33">[01:13:33]</a>
*   **Avoid Overheated Sectors**: Investing in companies without profits, especially those with very high valuations, is inherently risky and can lead to significant losses during market downturns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>
*   **Continuous Learning**: Ongoing education and professional guidance are valuable in navigating the complexities of the stock market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:38">[01:28:38]</a>
*   **Long-term Perspective**: Maintain a long-term vision and balance, avoiding euphoria during market highs and excessive negativity during lows. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:37">[01:30:37]</a>

The end of 2020 brought concerns about a potential new crisis in 2021, exacerbated by news of a mutated problem spreading at a greater speed, leading to panic among investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. This uncertainty has impacted sectors like airlines, hotels, and catering companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Further complicating the situation, new US economic stimulus measures were much lower than expected ($900 billion vs. anticipated double) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

Prominent investors have voiced concerns:
*   **Warren Buffett** urged the US government to increase stimulus measures to avoid economic disaster <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>. He emphasized the importance of providing liquidity to families and corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Stanley Druckenmiller** noted "absolute euphoria" in the markets, predicting the next 3 to 5 years will be "very, very complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. He highlighted that bull markets often end with euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. A key sign of current euphoria is that the traded volume of options has surpassed that of shares, with options being a leveraged instrument that can lead to total loss in market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>.
*   **Joel Greenblatt** pointed out a chilling fact: buying every company that lost money in 2019 but had over a billion dollars in market capitalization in 2020 would have yielded an impressive 65% return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This indicates that fundamental investment principles, such as requiring profits, are being overlooked in times of euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. Historically, consistently investing in loss-making companies has led to negative or significantly lower returns compared to the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

Despite these warnings, not all companies with current losses are necessarily bad investments, as examples like Amazon or Netflix show they can eventually generate significant profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Valuing High-Growth Stocks

A three-step method can be used to [[Stock Analysis and Investment Strategies | analyze high-growth stocks]] that are currently producing losses:
1.  **Estimate Future Sales**: Project sales for the next three to five years, assuming a growth rate lower than the current one, as growth typically slows with scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>.
2.  **Determine Future Profit Margins**: Assess potential profit margins once the company reaches maturity, by looking at established companies in the same sector (e.g., Toyota/Volkswagen for automotive, Microsoft/Google for technology) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier**: Use an earnings multiplier (e.g., 30-40 times for technology, 15-20 times for cyclical industries like automotive) to calculate the intrinsic value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

## Specific Stock [[Analysis of specific stocks and market opportunities | Analysis]]

### Nio (NIO)
*   **Ticker**: NIO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>
*   **Current Price**: $48 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>
*   **Description**: Nio, the Chinese version of Tesla, multiplied its value by over 12 times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. It has experienced losses in the past 12 months, but has shown exceptional performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Valuation (Example)**:
    *   **Future Sales**: Estimated at $47 billion in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>. For calculation, let's consider $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
    *   **Net Profit Margins**: Similar to large automotive companies like Volkswagen or Toyota (around 6%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. This would yield a net profit of $3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.
    *   **Earnings Per Share (EPS)**: Approximately $2 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   **Valuation Multiple**: For the automotive sector, typically around 10 times profits, but with higher growth, it could be 15-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
    *   **Intrinsic Valuation**: Multiplying $2 EPS by 15 results in an intrinsic valuation of around $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. This suggests Nio is currently trading above its fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
    *   **Upside Potential**: If Nio reaches $100 billion in sales, it could yield $4 profit per share, potentially valued at $80 per share with a 15-20x multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA)
*   **Ticker**: TSLA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>
*   **Current Price**: $680 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>
*   **Description**: One of the most [[Popular stocks among prominent investors | popular stocks]] on the market, multiplying its value by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. It had losses in 2019 but began generating profits in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Its inclusion in the S&P 500 index has propelled shares to new highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Bearish View**: Famous investor [[Analysis of Teslas stock and bearish bets | Michael Burry]] (from 'The Big Short') has invested against Tesla due to its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. He noted Tesla's capitalization at over $600 billion is higher than other traditional automobile manufacturers, despite generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. Bloomberg's [[Comparative analysis of companies and investment opportunities | analysis]] shows electric vehicle companies like Nio are valued at over $1.6 million per vehicle produced, and Tesla at over $1 million, while traditional manufacturers like Volkswagen ($10,000), Toyota ($25,000), and BMW ($26,000) are valued much lower per vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.
*   **Investment Considerations**: While Tesla's current profits are low, it has the capacity for drastic future increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a>. Investors should conduct detailed studies of its potential evolution rather than investing solely due to short-term price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>.

### Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
*   **Ticker**: PLTR <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>
*   **Current Price**: $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>
*   **Description**: A high-growth technology company with unique data [[Valuation and performance of specific stocks and sectors | analysis]] technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Listed for only three months, it has more than tripled on the stock market from its initial $10 listing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>. Palantir is currently producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.
*   **Valuation (Example)**:
    *   **Future Sales**: Expected to invoice around $1.4 billion in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:46">[00:14:46]</a>. Conservatively growing at 40% annually, it could generate $7.5 billion in sales in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
    *   **Profit Margins**: Large technology companies like Microsoft, Oracle, or Google generate 20-25% profits on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. This would imply potential profits of $1.8 billion for Palantir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>.
    *   **EPS**: Approximately $1 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>.
    *   **Valuation Multiple**: For the technology sector, a multiple of 30 times earnings is applicable for high-quality companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>.
    *   **Intrinsic Valuation**: Multiplying $1 EPS by 30 results in a fair value of around $30 per share for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>. This suggests the current stock price largely incorporates future benefit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

### Alibaba (BABA)
*   **Ticker**: BABA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>
*   **Current Price**: $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:38">[00:16:38]</a>
*   **Description**: Alibaba is facing an investigation by the Chinese government for alleged monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Some speculate this is a message to founder Jack Ma, who has been critical of the Communist Party <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Financials**: From a financial perspective, its current [[Valuation and performance of specific stocks and sectors | valuation]] is very attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. Its intrinsic value could potentially be double the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>, with significant future growth expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>.
*   **Political Risk**: Unlike other investments, the financial factor is currently irrelevant due to the political situation in China, where investor rights are fewer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>. Monitoring how the situation evolves and if the company cooperates with government guidelines is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>.

## Protecting Investments in Uncertain Times

In volatile market conditions, it's important to invest with common sense, avoiding extremes like investing against the market or waiting 100% for opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
1.  **Maintain Liquidity**: Have 10-30% liquidity in the portfolio for 2021, as the market statistically corrects at least 10% every year, creating opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>.
2.  **Invest with Conviction**: Only invest in companies where thorough [[Stock Analysis and Investment Strategies | analysis]] has been conducted and there is a strong conviction in its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Good investment opportunities can always be found, even in euphoric or expensive markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
3.  **Monitor Major Investors**: Observe how major investors position their portfolios. For example:
    *   **Stanley Druckenmiller**'s main investments include Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft, characterized by high growth and profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>.
    *   **Michael Burry**'s main investments focus on Google, Pfizer, and a pharmaceutical company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>.
    *   [[Analysis of Buffetts major investments in companies like Apple Bank of America and CocaCola | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] for 2021 also provides insights into his recent investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.

## Druckenmiller's Recession Forecast for 2023

Druckenmiller, a highly admired investor, has predicted an economic recession in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He believes the current bear market has further potential to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>. This prediction follows the Federal Reserve's historic interest rate hike, which historically has led to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

Druckenmiller firmly assumes a recession will occur in 2023, though he doesn't specify if it will be at the beginning or end of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. He notes that markets anticipate recessions, with the stock market typically falling six months to a year before a recession begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. This explains the "first bearish leg" already experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. He expects the second half of 2022 to be quite bearish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### Historical Context for Inflation and Recession
Historically, inflation rising from a low point and exceeding 5% (currently 9%) has only been resolved in two ways: either the Fed raises rates above 5%, or through a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>. Inflation is a severe economic problem that can be tackled by destroying demand or generating more supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. Raising rates increases the cost of money and mortgages, discouraging expansion, which leads to contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Druckenmiller believes a recession is more likely because the high level of indebtedness in the system prevents central banks from raising rates to 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Instead, they might allow a mild recession to curb demand and reset the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. This aligns with statements from Fed officials about doing "whatever it takes" to combat inflation, without guaranteeing a soft landing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation on Market Valuations
High inflation levels significantly affect investment valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. When inflation is above 5%, the average market valuation (PER) drops significantly, potentially from 19-20 to 14 or 14.5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Part of the previous overvaluation in the S&P 500 (from 21-22) has already been eliminated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. If inflation is brought under control (Fed's goal for 2023), the market could return to a higher average valuation combined with higher potential profits in two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

## Druckenmiller's Crisis Detection Tools
Druckenmiller identifies crises by observing specific sectors that act as leading indicators, rather than relying on technical analysis tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. He focuses on very cyclical and sensitive sectors that, when they begin to compress or deteriorate, signal future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. This approach helped him make short positions, especially against the Nasdaq, as these sectors began to deteriorate in January or February <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

The three main leading indicator sectors he looks at are:
1.  **Transportation Sector**: The Dow Jones Transportation Average, visible on Yahoo Finance, tends to fall sharply before economic recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>.
2.  **Construction or Housing Sector**: The homebuilders index for American construction companies also serves as an advance indicator, showing declines before crises like 2008 or 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>. The average mortgage cost in the U.S. has doubled, making it difficult to sell houses and causing the real estate sector to drop sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
3.  **Retail Sector**: The retail sales index shows significant declines in major retailers, often falling much more than the S&P 500 (e.g., 30-50% compared to 21-22% for S&P 500) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:37">[00:15:37]</a>.

In contrast, sectors like stable consumption or healthcare are lagging indicators; they may fall later in a recession as people sell safer assets to capitalize on opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_for_uncertain_times | Investment Strategies for Uncertain Times]]
Druckenmiller believes the first part of the market fall has already occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. During bear markets, he generally avoids betting against the market due to "bear market rebounds," preferring to operate with long-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Bonds typically rise when the market anticipates a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. However, this recession is different as both stocks and bonds have fallen, leading him to short both for the first time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>. He now views bonds as being in a "reasonable area of fair value" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

His favorite way to profit from crises is not by betting against the market, but by taking advantage of opportunities when they arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:56">[00:23:56]</a>.

### Approach to Different Asset Classes
*   **Long-Term Bonds**: When inflation drops and a recession hits, the Fed might "pivot" and lower rates (e.g., to 1.5%), causing long-term bond indexes to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:42">[00:24:42]</a>. He operates with leverage in these instruments to magnify returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:01">[00:25:01]</a>.
*   **Energy and Raw Materials**: He remains invested in energy due to predicted energy deficits for 5-10 years if policies aren't changed to facilitate new wells <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>. However, he cautions about the recent large capital inflow into the energy sector, as euphoria often precedes risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
*   **Bitcoin vs. Gold**:
    *   **Bitcoin**: If an "inflationary bull market" were to occur (Fed being irresponsible, allowing inflation and market rises), he would want to hold Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. He sold his Bitcoin position after it doubled or tripled in 2020-21 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.
    *   **Gold**: In a bear market with inflation (the current situation), he prefers gold and invests in gold-producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:37">[00:23:37]</a>.

## Investing in Quality and Cyclical Stocks
Druckenmiller notes that good companies have fallen by 60-70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.

### Quality Companies
These are companies with sustainable growth, high profit margins, and competitive advantages. Their valuation typically remains at a good level.
*   **Google (Alphabet)**: Its valuation has been significantly compressed, with its PER dropping from nearly 30 times earnings to 15 times for the next 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **TSMC (Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company)**: As the largest microchip manufacturer, TSM is a double-digit growth company (16% average in recent years) with stable, high margins due to its competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Its valuation has dropped significantly, now at only 10 times future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:02">[00:42:02]</a>.
*   **Moody's**: Considered an almost perfect business prototype due to its oligopoly position in rating agencies and high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:03">[00:43:03]</a>. It can even be seen as an inflationary play because it charges a percentage on bonds, so larger bond issuances due to inflation would mean more revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:41">[00:43:41]</a>. Despite a temporary slowdown in new debt issuance, its business is resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:12">[00:44:12]</a>.
*   **Microsoft**: A non-cyclical company that earns more money every year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:17">[00:52:17]</a>. Its valuation has finally dropped below its average of recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:29">[00:52:29]</a>.
*   **Amazon**: While its online sales part might not grow as much, its cloud computing (AWS) segment is growing significantly with high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. Its valuation is now implying almost zero value for online sales and is at levels typically seen for non-growth companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:09">[00:57:09]</a>.
*   **Barry Global**: A non-cyclical business with stable margins (around 10%) that has continued to grow even in crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Its valuation is now at a very low level, around 6-7 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>.
*   **Apple**: A mature business with a loyal audience and strong brand image, expected to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:09">[01:10:09]</a>. Its valuation has dropped below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.
*   **Nike**: Has a strong brand image and decent growth similar to Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:25">[01:12:25]</a>. Its valuation has returned to its historical average of 20-25 times earnings, after being overvalued at 45 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>.
*   **Facebook (Meta)**: Its valuation has been significantly compressed, now trading at around 10 times next year's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>. This is partly due to investments in virtual reality and a temporary slowdown in growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:21">[01:00:21]</a>.
*   **Verisign**: A monopoly on internet domain registration (.com, .net) with predictable growth and very high margins, returning profits through share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:17">[01:36:17]</a>. It trades at multiples above the market average, but has dropped <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:04">[01:37:04]</a>.

### Cyclical Stocks
These stocks are highly sensitive to economic cycles. The key is to buy them when profit margins are low (indicating a downturn in the industry) and sell when margins are high (indicating a peak) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:46">[00:34:46]</a>.
*   **Freeport-McMoRan (Mining)**: A large miner of copper and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>. It is a good company but cyclical, with high fixed costs and vulnerability to taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:23">[00:34:23]</a>. When its operating margins were very high (e.g., 43% in 2010-2011), it was most dangerous to invest, leading to collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:30">[00:35:30]</a>. Conversely, when it lost money (e.g., -20% margin in 2016), it was an opportune time to buy as supply gets destroyed, leading to future price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:44">[00:36:44]</a>.
*   **Asset Managers (e.g., T. Rowe Price, BlackRock)**: Highly leveraged to market performance. When the stock market falls, assets under management decrease, and people tend to withdraw money, impacting income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:12">[01:31:12]</a>. However, they have high profit margins and are scalable, so they recover quickly in bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:34">[01:31:34]</a>. They have a cyclical component that makes them fall more when the S&P goes down, but also rise more when it goes up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.

### Small Caps and Other Opportunities
Small-cap stocks are rarely as cheap in terms of valuation as they are currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:07">[01:00:07]</a>. The Russell 2000 (main small companies in the US) is below 10 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 15-16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:19">[01:00:19]</a>. This presents significant opportunities, similar to 2008, 2011, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

## General Investment Philosophy in Downturns
*   **Embrace Volatility**: Downturns provide opportunities. Such market falls happen on average every five to eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:25">[00:20:25]</a>. Investors should be most interested in the stock market when it is cheapest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:37">[00:20:37]</a>.
*   **Asymmetric Risk-Reward**: The most successful investors, like George Soros and Druckenmiller, learned to focus on how much money they could earn if they were right versus how much they could lose if they were wrong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:51">[01:02:51]</a>. The goal is to win a lot when right and lose little when wrong, even if having more losing positions than winning ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View**: [[investment_strategy_during_a_stock_market_crisis | During a stock market crisis]], making money usually takes 3-5 years, not months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:53">[00:59:53]</a>.
*   **Training and Knowledge**: Understanding how to classify and analyze different types of companies (e.g., cyclical vs. non-cyclical) is crucial for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>.
*   **Avoid Speculative Bubbles**: Don't invest in companies that lose money or are listed at absurdly high valuations (e.g., 50 times sales) without understanding the underlying business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:07">[01:41:07]</a>.
*   **Curiosity and Enjoyment**: Success in investing comes from an innate curiosity to understand how macroeconomic events reflect on asset prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. It's important to enjoy the process of researching and analyzing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:10">[01:09:10]</a>

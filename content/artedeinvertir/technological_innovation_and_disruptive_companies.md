Kathy Wood has emerged as a prominent figure on Wall Street, known for her focus on [[emerging_sectors_and_trends_in_the_fourth_industrial_revolution | technological innovation]] and disruptive companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. In 2020, her main investment fund achieved a 170% return, and over the last five years, it has seen over 700% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. Having founded her [[investment_in_technology_and_logistics_companies | investment company]], ARK Invest, in 2015, she now manages over $30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Kathy Wood's Investment Philosophy

Wood defines herself as an investor in innovation and disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Her approach differs significantly from traditional Wall Street investment standards, which typically focus on a business's numerical financial and accounting aspects, often leading to a disregard for promising stocks if they don't pass financial ratio filters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>.

Instead, Wood prioritizes two basic premises for [[investing_in_exceptional_businesses | investing in exceptional businesses]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>:
1.  **Revolutionary Nature**: The company must be revolutionary, either transforming a mature sector (like Spotify in music <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>) or directly creating new sectors (like Teladoc in telemedicine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>).
2.  **High Sales Growth**: The company must exhibit high sales growth, even if it doesn't currently produce economic benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Wood's theory suggests that many of these companies will dominate their markets, reinvesting earnings for growth and market share, similar to Amazon, which focused on rapid growth and market share for decades before becoming highly profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>.

She avoids [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | traditional companies]] operating in mature sectors with limited growth capacity, such as Nestl√© <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

## Key Investment Sectors

According to ARK Invest, Kathy Wood's six favorite sectors for [[stock_opportunities_in_healthcare_and_technology_sectors | investment opportunities in healthcare and technology sectors]] are <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>:
*   Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Autonomous Cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   3D Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Financial Technology (Fintech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

## Market Warning: A Deflationary Future

Kathy Wood has warned investors about a "major bubble" and "enormous risk" in passive or indexed management and main indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, or MSCI World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. She argues that these indices are designed for an inflationary world, unlike the deflationary scenario she believes we are heading towards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. This shift is driven by high [[emerging_sectors_and_trends_in_the_fourth_industrial_revolution | technological innovation]] and significant cost reduction across many economic areas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Her forecast suggests that when these indices perform poorly and the bubble bursts, the market will favor companies with a high innovative and technological disruption component, which are often not included in traditional indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

She also stated:
> "I do not believe that we are in an equity bubble until we see a rotation of bonds towards equities despite the attraction that these instruments have for the older population, younger investors, millennials, prefer to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies and housing, in fact, they are the sectors that we like the most for next year." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>

This perspective contrasts with the fact that fixed income and bonds have seen the most money flow in recent years, where many experts agree there is a "tremendous bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

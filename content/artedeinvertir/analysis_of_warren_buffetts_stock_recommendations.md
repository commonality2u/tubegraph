[[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]], widely considered the greatest investor of all time, holds an annual conference that is closely observed by thousands of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The 2020 edition, which lasted over five hours, provided significant insights into his [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | investment strategy]] and market outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article compiles key takeaways from the conference, including his general market commentary and specific discussions or implied recommendations related to certain stocks.

## Warren Buffett's Market Outlook: A Message of Caution

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] conveyed a significant message of caution, not just through his words but also his actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. During the first quarter, he was a net seller of stocks and did not make new investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway's liquidity increased from $120 trillion to over $130 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

On the market's future, [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] stated, "We do not know exactly what happens when you voluntarily close a substantial part of our society" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. He noted that unlike the 2008 financial crisis caused by banks, the current situation is "a great experiment" with an "enormous range of possibilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Despite the short-term uncertainties, [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] remains convinced of the potential of the United States, similar to his conviction during World War II, the Cuban Missile Crisis, or the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. He continuously warned of potential short-term volatility but insisted that the long-term prospects, especially for the American stock market, remain intact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Asked why he wasn't buying stocks, [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] reflected on 2008, where his "timing was terrible" but what was available was "very attractive," leading to a good position despite the bad timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. His actions in the first quarter suggest he anticipates more volatility and is accumulating liquidity for a better time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

## Notable Portfolio Changes: Sale of Airline Stocks

A significant surprise from the conference was [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett's]] sale of his entire position in the four major American airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. This represented a combined investment exceeding $10 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

His reasoning for the sale was that "the airline business has changed significantly" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. He noted that airlines would need to borrow billions and repay that through future profits or by selling shares, drastically reducing investment potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. He projected it would take two to three years for passenger numbers to return to pre-crisis levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] stated that when he feels he has made a mistake in a position, he sells it completely, as was the case with the airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. The market reacted sharply to this news, with airline stocks falling over 10% on the day the sale was announced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

## Preventing Market Crashes: Lessons from History

[[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] also provided clues about factors to monitor to avoid a market crash akin to the Great Depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. He stressed the importance of studying market history, as "events tend to repeat themselves" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

During the 1930s crisis, over 4,000 banks went bankrupt, leading to massive loss of savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Unlike today, mechanisms to prevent such financial panic did not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>. The last similar event was in 2008, causing a 60%+ market crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

Therefore, monitoring the health of the financial system during market stress is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] expressed calm regarding the current financial system, noting no significant stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. His portfolio's main position is within four large American banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Views on Oil

[[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] commented on the oil market, noting the need to store excess oil due to low demand and competition between Russia and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. He predicted a significant drop in U.S. oil production because it's not profitable to extract oil below $40 a barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This explains his likely lack of investments in oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

## Discussion on Boeing's Financial Situation

[[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] discussed Boeing's financial situation, highlighting how quickly the company's future changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. Boeing recently had to request $25 billion and previously $14 billion, despite feeling in a "solid financial position" just a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. He stated that neither Boeing nor he knows their future, questioning the need for "so many new airplanes" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

## Stock Analysis and Valuation Examples

The conference led to an analysis of three specific stocks, two of which were influenced by [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett's]] comments or holdings.

### Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSM)

TSM was selected for analysis due to popular request and its leadership in the semiconductor sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. Listed in the U.S. under ticker TSM at $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

*   **Business Overview**: TSM is a world leader in microchip manufacturing, serving over 500 clients, including major corporations like AMD, NVIDIA, and Apple, which accounts for over 17% of TSM's income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: TSM operates on a "fabless" model, focusing solely on manufacturing chips designed by others (e.g., NVIDIA, Apple), unlike integrated companies like Intel or Samsung that design and manufacture their own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: TSM was an early adopter of this model and has developed a scale that is hard to compete with <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>. This scale is crucial in the semiconductor sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. It has also helped TSM smooth out the typically cyclical nature of the semiconductor industry; for instance, its profits increased over 50% between 2007 and 2010, one of the worst periods for the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
*   **Financial Metrics**:
    *   **Profit Margin**: TSM boasts a gigantic 40% profit margin on revenue, exceeding Intel's 30% operating profit margin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
    *   **Return on Invested Capital (ROIC)**: Consistently above 25%, significantly higher than the industry average of 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>. These figures indicate a high-quality company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>.
*   **Valuation**:
    *   TSM has no debt and is minimally affected by the current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   Estimated earnings for the year are around $3 per share, currently trading at a P/E of around 17 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
    *   Assuming 10% annual growth over the next few years (consistent with prior five years), earnings per share could reach $5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.
    *   Historically, TSM has traded at a P/E of 16 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
    *   **Future Target Price**: $5 (EPS) * 16 (P/E) = $90 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>. This represents an interesting potential from its current $50 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>.

### JP Morgan (JPM)

JP Morgan is a major position in [[Buffetts 2021 stock portfolio | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>, listed in the U.S. under ticker JPM at $90 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

*   **Business Overview**: JP Morgan is a high-quality bank that has grown over 15 times on the stock market in the past 30 years, significantly outperforming other banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:01">[00:14:01]</a>.
*   **Importance of Management**: Investing in banks requires high confidence in the management team due to their complex operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] considers Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan, "probably one of the best and most trustworthy managers in America" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.
*   **Financial Metrics**:
    *   **Return on Equity (ROE)**: A key metric for banks, calculated by dividing profit by equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. JP Morgan is the undisputed leader among major American banks in this regard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.
*   **Valuation (Warren Buffett's Method)**:
    *   [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] explicitly provided guidance on valuing banks, specifically stating that a business earning 15.6-17% on its tangible equity is "incredible" in a 3% bond world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.
    *   He advises valuing bank stocks based on their price-to-book value ratio instead of P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.
    *   JP Morgan's tangible book value is $60 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
    *   [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]] suggests the current price should be three times that book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>.
    *   **Current Suggested Target Price**: $60 (Book Value) * 3 = $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>.
    *   He further noted that book value will likely grow to $90 per share over the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
    *   **Future Target Price (5 years)**: $90 (Future Book Value) * 3 = $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.
    *   This represents a very interesting potential from its current $90 share price, explaining [[Buffetts 2021 stock portfolio | Warren Buffett's]] $8 billion investment in JPM <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>.

### Boeing (BA)

Boeing was mentioned by [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] during the conference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>, listed in the U.S. under ticker BA at $120 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:47">[00:16:47]</a>.

*   **Historical Performance**: Since going public in the 1960s, Boeing's stock has multiplied over 200 times, proving an excellent investment historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>.
*   **Current Challenges**: Boeing has seen a sharp fall from almost $400 to $120 per share due to two main problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>:
    1.  **Current Global Crisis**: Expected to affect new aircraft demand for the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
    2.  **737 Max Design Problems**: Led to two fatal accidents in 2018 and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:24">[00:17:24]</a>.
*   These factors have moved Boeing from a solvent company to one facing serious financial trouble, requiring nearly $30 billion in debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Outlook**:
    *   The current crisis is expected to dissipate, with aviation returning to normal in the next three to four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>.
    *   Design problems, while significant, are common in the industry and are solvable; for example, the Boeing Dreamliner was grounded in 2013 but later became successful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. The 737 Max is considered a very competitive model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:12">[00:18:12]</a>.
    *   Air traffic is estimated to fall 20% this year and not recover to pre-crisis levels until 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. This will lead to lower income and profits for Boeing and Airbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. However, in the long term, income will recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:48">[00:18:48]</a>.
*   **Valuation**:
    *   Analysts estimate that by 2022, after aviation recovers and 737 Max issues are resolved, Boeing may be earning $12 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:19">[00:19:19]</a>.
    *   Historically, Boeing has traded at an average P/E of 20 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:30">[00:19:30]</a>.
    *   **Future Target Price**: $12 (EPS) * 20 (P/E) = $240 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. This offers interesting potential over three years from its current $120 share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>.
*   **Risks**: The high debt load significantly increases risk. If the current problem extends into 2021 or 2022, it could lead to capital increases (diluting shares) or government bailouts, affecting future valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:44">[00:19:44]</a>.

## Key Investment Lessons from Warren Buffett

*   **Actions Speak Louder Than Words**: [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy | Warren Buffett]] often emphasizes doing things the way he does them, not just the way he says <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. His increased liquidity signals caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.
*   **Correcting Mistakes**: When [[Insights on Warren Buffetts views | Warren Buffett]] feels he's made a mistake in a position, he sells it completely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Study Market History**: To understand future market behavior, it is crucial to study historical events, as they tend to repeat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.
*   **Compound Interest**: The power of compound interest applies not only to investments but also to real life. Initial progress may seem slow, but there is a turning point where growth accelerates radically for knowledge and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.
*   **Invest in Good Companies at Attractive Prices**: [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] advises monitoring two factors for successful long-term investing: investing in good companies and acquiring them at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. Company numbers (profit margins, return on invested capital) often reveal the quality of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.
*   **Thorough Research**: Investors should conduct their own research by accessing company annual reports, press releases, and presentations via investor relations websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. It is vital to make informed decisions and be responsible for one's own investment choices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>.

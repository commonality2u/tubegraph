## Introduction
There is a significant and growing interest in learning about finance, investing, and analyzing stocks, with many people keen to understand how to approach the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article condenses experience and strategies for successful [[Stock market investments and strategies | stock market investments]].

## General Investment Philosophy & Principles
### Importance of Learning
To succeed in the stock market, it's crucial to learn "how to fish" rather than just being given the fish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. This involves understanding investment approaches, finding information, and utilizing helpful websites <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Education and structured training can provide the knowledge accumulated over years to manage investments professionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

### Long-Term Perspective and Patience
Investments should always be viewed with a 3 to 5-year horizon, focusing on how a company's earnings can grow over that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. Short-term price movements and market sentiment can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:01">[01:00:01]</a>.

### Avoiding Short-Term Speculation and Greed
While both investing and speculating can be profitable, it is vital to understand the difference and not confuse the terms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:35">[01:16:35]</a>. Rapid wealth generation strategies are often risky and can lead to significant losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:41">[01:15:41]</a>. Many who lose money in the market do so by buying a few trendy stocks at euphoric highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:29">[01:14:29]</a>.

### Diversification and Portfolio Management
A balanced portfolio of at least 10 to 15, or even 20-25 companies for beginners, is a safer way to start investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This mitigates the risk of individual stock performance and focuses on the overall portfolio's expectation of success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:56">[01:13:56]</a>.

### Emotional Control During Volatility
Market volatility is normal and expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. Historically, a 10% market fall occurs approximately every 12 months, and a fall greater than 20% happens every 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:26">[01:18:26]</a>. Overreacting by selling during downturns can lead to missed opportunities when the market rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>. Maintaining some liquidity (e.g., 10-20% of funds) allows for buying opportunities during market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.

### Current Market Outlook
The market is currently a "dichotomy," with some parts experiencing euphoria and high valuations, while others are undervalued due to pessimism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>. The Federal Reserve's (Fed) liquidity injections and low interest rates have significantly fueled the recent rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. If the Fed's narrative changes, particularly regarding interest rates, the market could face significant falls, especially for highly valued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:51">[01:24:51]</a>.

> [!tip] Expected Market Returns
> According to historical data, with the current market valuation, the expected annual return for the S&P 500 over the next five years is close to zero <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[Stock market trends and investment strategies | stock picking]] in the current environment rather than relying solely on broad market indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>.

## Investment Vehicles & Approaches
### Investment Funds
Managing diverse portfolios across various funds (e.g., True Value, True Value Small Caps, True Capital) allows for exposure to different market segments and company sizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:54">[00:53:54]</a>.

### Small Caps vs. Large Caps
Private investors hold a significant advantage in [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | small caps]] compared to professionals, as large funds cannot easily invest in illiquid or small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. This can lead to higher returns for private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>.

### Spinoffs
Spinoffs involve taking attractive business units from a parent company and listing them independently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. These can offer significant value, as the combined value of the parent company and its spinoffs can far exceed the original company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>. They often list at very attractive multiples, especially international ones, due to less market attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:03">[01:22:03]</a>.

### IPOs vs. SPACs
Traditional Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) involve significant regulatory scrutiny, which SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) largely bypass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:21">[01:40:21]</a>. SPACs, often "empty shells" that later acquire companies, can be used by less reputable companies to go public quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:38">[01:40:38]</a>. While some SPACs might offer short-term trading opportunities, they are speculative and carry higher risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:32">[01:41:32]</a>.

### Stock Picking vs. Passive ETFs
In a market where overall returns might be low (like the current S&P 500 outlook), [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | stock picking]] becomes more crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:10">[01:29:10]</a>. Identifying individual undervalued companies with good prospects can still yield positive returns even if the broader market is stagnant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>. Passive ETFs can be a good long-term strategy for disciplined investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:37">[01:27:37]</a>.

## Stock Analysis & Valuation
### Key Information Sources
*   **Investor Relations Websites**: Always the first step when researching a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Look for annual reports, quarterly reports, press releases, and investor presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.
*   **Financial Tools**: Platforms like Yahoo Finance and TKR are useful for checking stock quotes, financial data, and analyst estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:21">[00:18:21]</a>.
*   **Regulatory Filings**: SEC filings (e.g., 10-K, 10-Q) for US companies provide detailed financial and operational information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:30">[01:19:30]</a>.
*   **JP Morgan Market Guide**: A free quarterly document that provides a useful overview of market conditions, valuations, and historical returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:55">[01:20:55]</a>.

### Valuation Metrics
*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio**: A common metric; a low P/E can indicate an undervalued company, especially compared to historical averages or peers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
*   **Price-to-Sales (P/S) Ratio**: Often used for high-growth companies that are not yet profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:28">[01:17:28]</a>. However, paying more than 10 times sales historically does not usually yield good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:24">[01:25:24]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF)**: A measure of a company's financial performance that shows how much cash it generates after accounting for capital expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization)**: Indicates a company's operational profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.
*   **Gross Merchant Value (GMV)**: Key for marketplace businesses, representing the total value of goods sold through the platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:33">[01:26:33]</a>.

### Operating Leverage
Companies with high operating leverage can see a disproportionate increase in profits relative to sales growth, as fixed costs are amortized over a larger revenue base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:33">[01:27:33]</a>.

### Identifying Opportunities
Opportunities arise when the market is inefficient, such as in the small-cap segment or when information is not readily available (e.g., reports only in local languages) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>. This allows for investing in solid companies at attractive multiples before they become widely recognized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:26">[01:22:26]</a>.

## Featured Stocks & Analysis
### IDT Corporation (IDT)
*   **Business Model**: Operates a mature business generating strong cash flow, which is reinvested into high-growth, disruptive technological ventures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:35">[00:36:35]</a>. These new businesses are then monetized by selling them to larger corporations or through spinoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Spinoffs**: The company has a history of successful spinoffs, generating significant shareholder value (e.g., 20% annual return over 10 years including spinoffs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. Yahoo Finance graphs may not adjust for spinoffs, causing apparent drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **New Businesses**: Includes BOSS Revolution (money transfer, high growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:20">[01:12:20]</a> and Netfone (cloud communications, rapidly growing in Latin America and Spain) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:38">[01:13:38]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Despite recent appreciation, IDT is considered undervalued when assessing its traditional business (trading at 6x earnings) plus the value of its high-growth segments (valued conservatively by the company at up to $50 per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:20">[01:15:20]</a>. The company also benefits from substantial liquidity and tax deductions (NOLs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>.

### Cedon (Amazon of Sweden)
*   **Business Model**: An e-commerce platform in Nordic countries, often referred to as the "Amazon of Sweden" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:21">[01:21:21]</a>. It has successfully pivoted from a "1p" (own sales) model to a more profitable "marketplace" (third-party seller) model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:21">[01:25:21]</a>.
*   **Growth**: While overall sales growth might appear modest due to the declining old business, the marketplace segment is growing rapidly (e.g., 60% year-over-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:40">[01:25:40]</a>. It demonstrates significant operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:31">[01:27:31]</a>.
*   **Valuation Opportunity**: Was initially attractive due to being a spinoff, listed at favorable multiples, and having information primarily in Swedish, deterring international investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:09">[01:22:09]</a>. Despite recent rises, it remains less expensive than similar high-growth e-commerce companies when valued by Gross Merchant Value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:47">[01:26:47]</a>.

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)
*   **Business Model**: A leading defense contractor, known for key military equipment like the F-35 fighter jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:09">[01:35:09]</a>.
*   **Market Perception**: Often undervalued when Democrats win elections due to a false market belief that defense budgets will be significantly cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:28">[01:34:28]</a>. However, core defense programs (like fighter jets) are rarely cut due to their importance for military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:51">[01:35:51]</a>.
*   **Outlook**: Rising military spending by rivals like China further reinforces the need for continued investment in advanced defense systems by the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:39">[01:36:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trading below its historical average P/E, with consistent earnings growth (12-17%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:07">[01:38:07]</a>.

### IPCO (Oil Company)
*   **Business Model**: A small oil company with significant profits at current oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:40">[01:43:40]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trading at a very cheap multiple of earnings (around 4 times) compared to the industry average (8-10 times), indicating potential for double to triple its current value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:56">[01:43:56]</a>. This sector is currently out of fashion, leading to undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:03">[01:45:03]</a>.

### Jumia (JMIA)
*   **Business Model**: Often called the "Amazon of Africa," it's an e-commerce platform in a growing market where Amazon currently has low priority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:47">[01:45:47]</a>.
*   **Growth & Valuation**: Exhibits good growth (e.g., 32% expected in the current year) but is not yet profitable at the EBITDA level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:02">[01:46:02]</a>. It trades at a "quite generous multiple" of around 20 times sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:21">[01:46:21]</a>.

### Tesla (TSLA) / NIO (NIO)
*   **High Growth, High Valuation**: These companies operate in the electric vehicle (EV) market and are highly speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:20">[01:49:20]</a>. They currently produce little to no profits, and their high valuations (e.g., Tesla is very demanding) depend on future exponential growth in car sales and additional revenue streams like software and autonomous driving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:30">[01:49:30]</a>.
*   **Market Share & Competition**: Tesla's global EV market share is dropping due to increasing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:22">[01:51:22]</a>.
*   **Risk**: High valuations mean significant downside risk if short-term expectations are not met <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>. It's crucial to deeply understand their business model and future profit generation before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:17">[01:54:17]</a>.

### Globant (GLOB) / Nagarro (NA9) / EPAM Systems (EPAM)
*   **Business Model**: These are computer engineering companies utilizing an "offshore" model, hiring engineers in regions with lower labor costs (e.g., Latin America, Eastern Europe, India) to provide services remotely to clients globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:45">[01:52:45]</a>.
*   **Market Opportunity**: The computer engineering market is massive (estimated at $300 billion annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:27">[01:53:27]</a>. These companies are rapidly gaining market share from traditional firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:41">[01:52:41]</a>.
*   **Growth & Profitability**: Exhibit strong revenue growth (e.g., Globant at 25% annual growth) and increasing profits due to efficient cost structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:47">[01:52:47]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: While high (e.g., Globant at 80 times earnings), the market tolerates these multiples due to the large addressable market and sustained growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:08">[01:57:08]</a>. Nagarro, as a European spinoff, has shown significant upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:32">[01:54:32]</a>.

### Johnson & Johnson (JNJ) / AbbVie (ABBV) / Bristol Myers Squibb (BMY)
*   **Business Model**: Mature biotechnology/pharmaceutical companies with stable but low growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:41">[02:01:41]</a>. JNJ also has a significant consumer products division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:20">[02:02:20]</a>.
*   **Crisis Resilience**: Known for their resistance to economic crises and low debt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:51">[02:01:51]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Currently trading below their historical average P/E (e.g., JNJ at 16x earnings vs. historical 20-25x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. Their prices were suppressed during the Trump administration due to fears of drug price cuts, but earnings have since increased, making them cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:04:46">[02:04:46]</a>.

### HP Inc. (HPQ)
*   **Business Model**: Operates in consumer technology (printers, PCs) with a declining revenue trend but stable profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:46">[02:05:46]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: A mature company unlikely to grow significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:04">[02:06:04]</a>. It is considered cheap (e.g., potential valuation at 12 times profits) and has recovered significantly since vaccine news improved market sentiment for "value" stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:50">[02:06:50]</a>.

### Apig Group (APG)
*   **Business Model**: A holding company primarily involved in stable service businesses like fire alarm system installation and maintenance, electrical installations, and liquid waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:30">[02:07:30]</a>. Around 80% of its income is very stable and recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:06">[02:08:06]</a>.
*   **Leadership**: Founded by Martin Franklin, a "value generator" who has a proven track record of creating significant shareholder wealth through previous ventures like Jarden Corporation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:28">[02:08:28]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Was attractive when purchased at $11-12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:59">[02:09:59]</a>.

### Nomad Foods (NOMD)
*   **Business Model**: Sells frozen food products in Europe (e.g., Findus) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:20">[02:10:20]</a>. It's a stable market segment with slow organic growth (2-3%) supplemented by acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:44">[02:10:44]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Valued by free cash flow and currently trades at about 11 times earnings, which is considered cheap for a stable food consumption business (historical average 15-20 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:32">[02:11:32]</a>.

### Enbridge (ENB) / Kinder Morgan (KMI)
*   **Business Model**: Companies with monopolies on gas and oil transportation pipelines in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:05">[02:18:05]</a>.
*   **Market Sentiment**: Despite having higher profits and EBITDA now than in 2014-2015, they are currently out of fashion and trading at very cheap multiples (e.g., Enbridge at 8 times normalized earnings vs. historical 16 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:39">[02:18:39]</a>.
*   **Dividend**: Enbridge offers a high and sustainable dividend yield (around 7.5%), expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:59">[02:18:59]</a>.

### AT&T (T)
*   **Business Model**: Similar profile to Enbridge, a very stable company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:44">[02:22:44]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trading below its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:47">[02:22:47]</a>.

### Fiverr International (FVRR)
*   **Business Model**: A marketplace for freelance services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:58">[02:24:58]</a>.
*   **Growth & Valuation**: High growth (75% this year, slowing to 38% next year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:16">[02:26:16]</a>. Currently trades at a very high multiple (e.g., 40 times sales, or 90 times future earnings), reflecting significant future growth discounted into the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:24">[02:25:24]</a>.

### Envato / Etsy
*   **Business Model**: Online marketplaces that gain profitability as they achieve scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:47">[02:28:47]</a>. They generate high EBITDA margins (e.g., Etsy at 30%) once operating leverage kicks in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:30">[02:28:30]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: While they may trade at high multiples (e.g., Etsy at 10 times sales), they can expand significantly when profitability is demonstrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:14">[02:31:14]</a>.

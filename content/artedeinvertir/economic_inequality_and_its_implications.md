Ray Dalio, a globally recognized investor, has warned that a new world economic order is emerging, which he describes as one of the biggest economic and social reforms in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This shift is expected to have serious implications for both the stock market and the broader economy, potentially causing a major crisis in the U.S. and worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Economic Cycle Theory

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, which manages $100 billion, is often likened to the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the high reliability of his economic and stock market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. He has identified a "great cycle" in economic history, noting that the current world order began in 1945 after World War II, establishing the dollar as the world reserve currency and leading to a period of peace and prosperity under a dominant power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. However, this period is "about to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. Political extremism in the U.S. is expected to accelerate this process towards a new world economic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>.

Through historical study, Dalio found that every dominant economy, like the U.S. for the past 70 years, undergoes distinct phases of economic rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. The U.S. is currently entering a decline phase, characterized by:
*   High levels of [[global_debt_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | debt]] in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   Alarming quantities of money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.

These factors directly lead to [[understanding_monetary_problems_and_social_inequality | economic and social inequality]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>. Conversely, China is currently in an upward phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Dalio specifically warns that the present monetary environment disproportionately affects the middle and lower classes, who often lack the savings or financial investments to protect against [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflationary pressures]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## Causes and Consequences of Economic Inequality

Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve has printed record amounts of money, increasing its balance sheet from one trillion to over seven trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. This "economic experiment" has led to decades-high inflation levels and significant price increases for raw materials, products, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The "helicopter money theory," which suggests printing vast sums of money and distributing them to stimulate the economy after a recession, was put into practice in 2020 with the U.S. government sending $1,200 checks to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. However, Dalio points out that if printing money were the solution to economic problems, countries like Zimbabwe would be the wealthiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Historically, this approach has led to ruin in countries such as Germany, Argentina, Venezuela, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

Dalio emphasizes that this situation is leading to extreme levels of [[wealth_inequality_and_its_effects_on_the_economy | economic inequality]] and discontent in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For example, just three individuals, including Jeff Bezos, hold more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The richest 1% of the American economy has continuously prospered over the last 40 years, accumulating an increasing amount of wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Three Economic Problems from Inequality

Historically, such social inequality leads to three major [[economic_indicators_and_their_implications | economic problems]] that impact savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>:
1.  **Rising Taxes**: Taxes are expected to increase in the U.S. and globally, as seen with proposals from Joe Biden <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This negatively affects the stock market by reducing corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions**: Economic conditions are predicted to deteriorate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The Federal Reserve has warned of future [[interest_rate_hikes_and_economic_implications | interest rate hikes]], which would particularly harm highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
3.  **Increased Regulations and Wealth Redistribution**: An increase in new regulations and measures aimed at redistributing wealth is anticipated, which would negatively impact almost any type of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

### The Biggest Risk: Conflict and Revolution

Ray Dalio identifies the bankruptcy of governments after economic shocks, coupled with large economic inequalities and [[class_struggle_and_wealth_inequality | class differences]], as the single most important advanced indicator of wars and revolutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. While this risk is not immediate, Dalio warns that if the economy continues its current trajectory, it could reach an inflection point with severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Protecting Investments in an Inflationary Environment

In such an economic environment, Dalio advises against selling assets for liquidity, as the value of money will decrease in an inflationary scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Instead, he suggests being strategically invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>. His investment philosophy, designed to perform well in almost any economic environment, includes having at least 40% of a portfolio in stocks that tend to do well in this new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Based on historical data, sectors that perform best in an inflationary environment include energy and raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

Dalio also strongly recommends having at least 10% of a portfolio in gold, as it is expected to perform well if this new world order materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>. He states that money printing always decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth towards financial assets, historically raising the price of gold and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>.

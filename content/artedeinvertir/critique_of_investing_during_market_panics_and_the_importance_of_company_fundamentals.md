In times of market panic and widespread sell-offs, extraordinary liquidity measures are often approved, which are expected to have a positive impact on stock markets in the medium and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. A key approach to successful investing during such periods is to study the strategies of the world's most successful investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>.

## Investing During Market Panics

Experienced investors often capitalize on market panics by [[investment_opportunities_in_stocks_during_financial_uncertainties | investing in high-quality companies]] at prices not seen for years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This strategy is based on the idea that temporary market problems can offer attractive valuations for fundamentally strong businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

### Insights from David Tepper
David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, is known for being one of the "bravest printers on Wall Street" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. He is among the first to buy stocks during periods of panic when most other investors are unwilling to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Tepper's best returns have historically followed these market panics, such as in 2001, 2009, and 2012, because these periods allowed him to invest at the most attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.

During an interview, Tepper suggested that the market could fall an additional 10 or 15 percent if investor panic persisted due to economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. However, he also noted that the approval of a package of measures by the U.S. Congress could signal "the end of the falls" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. These economic measures were approved two days after the interview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Bill Ackman's Approach
Bill Ackman, another legendary Wall Street investor, has a reputation for effectively navigating [[investing_in_bear_markets | bearish market periods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. For instance, in 2008, his fund only lost 13%, while the S&P 500 lost nearly 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Despite an initial "super bearish" stance, Ackman later became bullish and began aggressively buying shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

## Importance of Company Fundamentals

A core principle for investing, especially during crises, is the emphasis on strong company fundamentals. Investors should not buy just "any share" merely because its price has fallen or seems attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Instead, it is crucial to [[analyzing_company_fundamentals_for_investment | invest in good companies]] with solid competitive positions and low debt, as weaker, indebted companies may not survive economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Companies with strong fundamentals are expected to emerge stronger, increasing their market share and profits once the crisis subsides <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.

### Key Characteristics of Strong Companies:
*   **Low Debt:** Companies with low debt or a liquidity surplus are better positioned to weather economic challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
*   **Solid Competitive Position:** Businesses that dominate their industries are more resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
*   **Predictable Growth:** Businesses with predictable cash flow and demand for their products tend to generate good long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.
*   **Resilience to Crises:** Companies that can increase sales and profits even during economic crises demonstrate strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.

### Examples of Investments Meeting Criteria
Several companies are highlighted as examples of investments that meet these criteria:

*   **Airbus (A&R):**
    *   An example of a high-quality company available at attractive prices due to temporary problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
    *   Part of an oligopoly with Boeing that has dominated commercial aviation for 50 years and is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.
    *   Has a highly predictable business model, with an order book equivalent to seven years of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
    *   Possesses a liquidity surplus of $12 billion (20% of its market capitalization) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
    *   Historically, companies of this quality rarely trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.

*   **United Healthcare (UNH):**
    *   A leading company in offering private healthcare plans in the U.S., operating within an oligopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   Considered a defensive business; people rarely cancel health insurance during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.
    *   Increased sales and profits during the 2008 and 2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
    *   Has low debt and is expected to grow 5-10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.
    *   High-quality, predictable businesses like this with low debt should not trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>.

*   **Restaurant Brands International (USB):**
    *   Owns iconic brands like Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Horton's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>.
    *   Fast food stocks have historically been excellent investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.
    *   Menus are low-priced, making them resilient in economic crises; McDonald's increased sales in 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
    *   The company primarily receives royalties from franchisees, requiring less investment than operating restaurants directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.
    *   While it carries some debt, this is common for resilient businesses in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. Government aid to small business owners operating these restaurants has reduced risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>.
    *   Typically, fast food restaurant companies trade no lower than 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
    *   Plans to increase restaurant count from 26,000 to 40,000 in the next five years, which could significantly grow profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">[00:16:14]</a>.

It is important for individuals to conduct their own analysis and be responsible for their investment decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

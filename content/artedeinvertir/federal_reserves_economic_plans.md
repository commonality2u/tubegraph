The [[Federal Reserve report on economic forecasts | Federal Reserve]] (Fed) and its members actively assess and comment on the state of the economy, including the potential for future recessions and strategies to combat inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Predictions of Recession
Some members of the Fed have stated that a recession is "practically imminent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. A former president of the [[Federal Reserves economic strategies | Federal Reserve]] in New York specifically stated that a recession is "inevitable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. This former official believes [[central_banks_and_economic_recession_forecasts | central banks]] must act on inflation, which has caused the current bear market that is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

During a recent conference in Congress, Jerome Powell, the Fed Chairman, commented that recessions are "certainly a possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>. He also stated that the Fed is "tremendously committed to combating inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Powell acknowledged that current events make it more difficult for the Fed to achieve its goal of reducing inflation without causing a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. He highlighted the dependence on external factors not controlled by the Fed, such as the price of oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.

## Economic Data and Indicators
The president of the Atlanta Fed publishes preliminary data on American GDP, estimating that second-quarter growth may be around 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. This follows a negative first quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. A recession is typically defined by two consecutive quarters of decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Historically, cycles of [[federal_reserves_impact_on_interest_rates | rate hikes by the Fed]] have always ended with some negative economic or financial event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>:
*   **1998**: Russia's bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **2000**: Dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **2008**: Subprime crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **1994**: Collapse of emerging countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **1987**: Coincided with rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

The average market drop without a recession is typically 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, while with a recession, the average drop in the S&P 500 is 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Investment banks estimate the probability of a recession in the next 12 months to be 75% to 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

## Liquidity and Market Impact
A key factor influencing markets in the short and medium term is liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. There is a high correlation between the global money supply and the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. When the Fed printed a lot of money in March 2020 to address the crisis, liquidity (blue line) surged, and when it started to descend around January, the market also began to descend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>.

The Fed's balance sheet includes a "reverse repos facility" where banks and institutions can deposit money to earn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>. By raising short-term rates, the Fed encourages money to be deposited there, effectively draining liquidity from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. This mechanism is the Fed's tool to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Money deposited in these reverse repos has skyrocketed to roughly two trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:56">[00:15:56]</a>. This has significantly drained liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

Speculation exists that the Fed might cut rates if a recession is foreseen, which would release this money back into the economy and financial investments, potentially causing the stock market to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:59">[00:16:59]</a>.

## Inflationary Factors
Inflation has been influenced by:
*   **Supply bottlenecks and disruptions**: Due to issues like COVID-19 lockdowns, the economy collapsed, and many companies went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:35">[00:23:35]</a>. The rapid recovery led to supply shortages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:01">[00:24:01]</a>.
*   **Excess demand**: While typical average growth is 1%, demand has been at 2%, contributing to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

The goal of the [[Federal Reserves economic strategies | Fed]] is to reduce inflation to between 2% and 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>.

## Market Sentiment and Opportunity
Market sentiment is currently very negative, at levels similar to 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This is seen by some as a "good breeding ground for the future" and a time of significant opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>. European consumer confidence is also at a minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:43">[00:19:43]</a>, suggesting that the only way to go is up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:55">[00:19:55]</a>.

Historically, after massive market falls, investments are safer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. The deeper the fall, the safer it tends to be <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:30">[00:26:30]</a>. The average bear market typically lasts 14 months and sees a 33% drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:06">[00:27:06]</a>. In contrast, bullish cycles last much longer (average 70 months) and yield gigantic returns (almost 300% on average) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>.

Goldman Sachs recently registered the second-largest bearish activity and short selling in the stock market in its history, indicating extreme negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. In such moments, very little positive news is needed to reverse the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:48">[00:36:48]</a>.

When looking at the S&P 500 earnings yield minus the 10-year bond yield (as suggested by [[warren_buffetts_call_to_government_for_increased_economic_stimulus | Warren Buffett]] as a comparison against a risk-free asset), the current profitability of the S&P 500 relative to bonds is one of the highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a>. Historically, moments of high additional profitability (e.g., late 1970s, 2008-2010 crisis) were the best times to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.

The number of shares trading at very low multiples (e.g., three times operating profits) has significantly increased compared to previous years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:23">[00:37:23]</a>. In times of extreme panic or recession, there are paradoxically more cheap shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:54">[00:37:54]</a>.

## Companies to Watch
JP Morgan recommended several stocks for the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:16">[00:29:16]</a>:
*   **Fiserv (FISV)**: A financial services company that has historically performed well during interest rate increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:24">[00:43:24]</a>. It is a non-cyclical growth stock with high-profit margins (30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:27">[00:46:27]</a>. The company increased operating profits during the 2008-2010 financial crisis and actively bought back shares when they were undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Its current valuation is below its historical average, trading at 13 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:27">[00:50:27]</a>.
*   **Bank of America (BAC)**: A major U.S. bank, which are cyclical businesses but have consolidated, reducing competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:50">[00:52:50]</a>. Rising interest rates positively impact bank profits; a 1% increase in rates could mean $6 billion in additional profit for Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. Its valuation has dropped to its lowest since the 2008 crisis, only slightly above the March 2020 low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:39">[00:55:39]</a>.
*   **Lennar (LEN)**: One of the main homebuilders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:18">[00:56:18]</a>. The housing sector is cyclical and tends to decline in recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:21">[00:57:21]</a>. The market is currently offering it at 5 times earnings, implying a 20% profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. The main risk is the rise in 30-year mortgage rates in the U.S. to 5.78% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:32">[00:59:32]</a>, which could force house prices down and create excess supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:28">[01:00:28]</a>. However, the U.S. population growth drives a need for more homes annually, with current inventory levels balanced historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>.
*   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)**: An oil and gas company that has seen profits rise with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>. Its valuation is currently at 6 times earnings, which is lower than historical averages for this type of cyclical business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:50">[01:26:50]</a>.

Other companies mentioned for consideration include:
*   **Brookfield Asset Management (BAM)**: Manages private equity assets. Its shares have dropped due to rising rates making debt more expensive for private companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:26">[01:15:26]</a>.
*   **StoneCo (STNE)**: A Brazilian payment company that Warren Buffett invested in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>. Its growth has slowed, and margins have decreased due to increased competition from traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:55">[01:17:55]</a>.
*   **Zendesk (ZEN)**: A cloud software company for customer service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:10">[01:49:10]</a>. It trades at a high valuation (90 times earnings) despite a significant drop from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/B)**: Warren Buffett's company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>. It started the year well due to its inflation-resistant businesses but then saw a decline due to changing market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:27">[01:21:27]</a>. It is currently trading at a level Buffett considers undervalued, based on its book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.
*   **Dardan Restaurants (DRI)**: An American restaurant company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:53">[02:22:53]</a>. Its executives reported that the worst of commodity inflation seems to be in the rearview mirror <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>.

## [[Federal Reserves policies and market reactions | Impact of Federal Reserve policies on the economy]]
The Fed's actions, particularly [[Federal Reserves impact on interest rates | raising interest rates]], have a direct impact on market liquidity and investment attractiveness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. When rates are very low, people tend to invest in the stock market or start businesses, stimulating the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. Conversely, higher rates drain money from the market.

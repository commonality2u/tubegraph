Investing in small companies, often referred to as "small caps," offers significant advantages for individual investors, particularly those with smaller amounts of capital. This approach, championed by investors like Warren Buffett, allows for the potential of higher returns than typically found in larger, more well-known corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The "Small Money" Advantage

Warren Buffett has repeatedly stated that not having a large sum of money to invest can be a significant structural advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In 1999, he claimed he could achieve 50% annual returns if he managed less than a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. As his fortune grew, his possible returns diminished, moving from 50% a year to around 10% due to the sheer volume of assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>.

Buffett emphasizes that with a small sum, one's investment universe expands significantly, offering thousands of possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. In contrast, investing hundreds of trillions of dollars offers few alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

## Where to Look: Undervalued and Overlooked Companies

The key to finding these opportunities lies in looking "off the map" for [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | small, local companies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### The Small Cap Universe
In the U.S. alone, there are over 30,000 listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. However, only about 500 of these are part of the Standard and Poor's index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. These 500 largest companies are the most analyzed and well-known, making it very difficult to generate annual returns above 15% from them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

The real [[investment_opportunities_in_smallcap_stocks | opportunities]] lie within the other 29,500 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. These are often "local businesses" â€“ companies that are not globalized or international, and therefore not typically found in major indexes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. They can be "off the radar of many investors" and simply "ignored by the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

### Why Small Companies Offer High Returns
The potential for high returns in small companies stems from their low valuation relative to their earnings or assets. For example, a stock earning one dollar per share but trading at two dollars results in a P/E (Price-to-Earnings) ratio of two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. This low P/E could indicate a potential annual return of 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Real-World Examples

### Western Insurance
Warren Buffett recalled finding Western Insurance trading at three dollars a share, while it was making twenty dollars a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. This highlights a significantly undervalued company.

### Humanae
The True fund, when managing only 9 million euros, invested in Humanae <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Humanae was a micro-company with a capitalization of just 30 million euros, barely followed by analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. It was trading at 1.50 euros per share and was projected to earn one euro per share the following year, giving it a P/E of less than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:35">[00:03:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. The fund accumulated a position of about one million euros over four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Three years later, those shares traded at 6 euros, multiplying the purchase price by four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

### Korean Stocks (2004)
Around 2004, Buffett received a book on Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. He spent hours scanning the book, finding very [[examples_of_successful_small_company_investments | interesting opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>. He then invested 100 million dollars, divided among 20 of these Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

One example was Daehan Flour, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. Its earnings per share varied, and it had a significant amount of investments per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>. The stock was trading at 38,000 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. Buffett's investment yielded a very good return, with the stock quickly appreciating to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:04">[00:10:04]</a>.

## The Investor's Approach: Preparation and Hard Work

Success in finding these opportunities requires significant effort and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

### Research and Learning
Warren Buffett advises learning as much as possible about all kinds of American stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. This means investigating different businesses and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. He likens it to scanning "Moody's manuals" from his early days, which contained detailed information on thousands of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While physical manuals are rare now, free online resources like Yahoo Finance or Morningstar.com offer similar data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>.

> [!TIP] Learn About Industries
> Choose an attractive industry (e.g., health, IT, technology, transportation) and learn as much as possible about it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. Start by reading reports from the largest companies in that sector, as they often provide the most detailed information on how the sector functions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. Once you have that knowledge, look for smaller, potentially undervalued companies within that sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

### Utilizing Modern Tools
Today, "screens" (stock screeners) allow investors to filter the entire stock market by various parameters, such as low P/E ratios, growth rates, or profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[Advice for small investors | Essential Investment Principles]]
> *   **Time and Effort:** These opportunities won't come by themselves; you must invest time and effort in looking for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
> *   **No Luck, Only Preparation:** In the stock market, "luck does not exist; it is simply the combination of opportunity and preparation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.
> *   **Focus on Low P/E:** It is essential to focus on paying a low price-to-earnings ratio for investments to generate extraordinary returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
> *   **Buy as Much as Possible:** When a promising opportunity is identified, buy as many shares as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>.

## Longevity of Opportunities

These types of [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | situations]] have always existed in markets and will continue to exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. The reason these opportunities persist is that successful investors in small companies eventually manage larger sums of money, which limits their ability to invest in illiquid small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This ensures that the field of [[investment_in_small_caps_and_private_investing | small company investment]] remains open for new investors willing to put in the hard work and curiosity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

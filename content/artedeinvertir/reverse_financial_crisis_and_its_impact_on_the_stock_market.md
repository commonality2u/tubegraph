A new risk has emerged for the [[current_economic_risks_for_the_stock_market | stock market]] called the reverse crisis, which can significantly impact investments [00:00:03]. This scenario is becoming increasingly possible, and understanding its causes and consequences is crucial to protect capital and savings [00:00:10]. Recent decisions by central banks and governments are expected to accelerate this process [00:00:19]. Noted investors like Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, and Stanley Druckenmiller have already warned about this situation [00:00:24].

## Understanding the Reverse Financial Crisis

A reverse financial crisis is closely linked to inflation and the monetary policies of central banks and governments [00:00:57].

### Causes of the Crisis

*   **Money Printing:** The Federal Reserve and other central banks have been flooding the financial system with new currency [00:01:05]. Since 2008, printing new money has been a recurring solution to financial crises [00:01:11]. For example, in 2020, 22% of all dollars currently in circulation were printed in a single year, for a currency with 200 years of history [00:01:21].
*   **Government Fiscal Deficits:** Governments are increasingly spending more money than they collect through taxes, leading to increased borrowing and debt [00:01:33]. This practice weakens currency and generates inflation [00:01:40]. The United States deficit currently stands at 8%, a level comparable to the 2008 crisis [00:01:44].
*   **Inflation:** These factors have led to one of the largest inflation crises in the last 40 years, significantly transforming the economic outlook [00:01:52].

### The Paradox of Rising Investments

In a reverse crisis, similar to the rising prices of products and services in an inflationary environment, investments also experience a significant climb [00:02:07]. While this might seem positive at first glance, it can be very dangerous [00:02:19].

This type of crisis has already occurred in the main stock markets of countries such as Germany, Argentina, and Turkey [00:02:24].
*   The Merval Index in Argentina multiplied by 60 times in the last 5 years [00:02:31].
*   Turkey's market saw a 700% rise in just 5 years [00:02:36].
*   Germany experienced an 800% rise in less than 2 years [00:02:40].

### Nominal vs. Real Return

To understand an inverse financial crisis, it's important to distinguish between nominal and real returns [00:02:45].
*   **Nominal Return:** The apparent gain on an investment (e.g., an investment of 10,000 rising to 11,000, yielding a 10% nominal return) [00:02:52].
*   **Real Return:** The actual return after accounting for inflation [00:03:07]. If inflation is 15% during the period an investment yields 10% nominal return, the real return is a negative 5% [00:03:02]. This means purchasing power is lost because the price of services and products increased faster than the value of the money [00:03:13].

> [!INFO] Silent Problem
> This loss of purchasing power is a "silent problem" often ignored until it's too late [00:03:22]. Those with less financial literacy often suffer the most, bearing the full cost of inflation without benefiting from investments [00:03:32].

The current situation demonstrates this:
*   Accumulated inflation from 2021 until today has reached 20% due to government and central bank policies [00:03:53].
*   The S&P 500, a major [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | stock market]] index, would have needed to rise by 20% (to 5,700 points) to compensate for this inflation, but it is currently trading at around 5,200 points [00:04:08].
*   This represents a 10% loss in purchasing power for stock market investors using this index [00:04:28].
*   However, this is still better than those who did not invest, who have suffered a total 20% loss in purchasing power [00:04:35].
*   Inflation continues to rise, causing main [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | stock market]] indices to reach historical highs due to this reverse crisis effect [00:04:44].

## Negative Real Interest Rates: A Key Factor

Reverse crises are closely related to negative real interest rates [00:05:10]. This occurs when the inflation level is higher than the interest rate set by a country's Central Bank [00:05:13].

*   **Argentina:** Over the last 12 years, Argentina's average real interest rate has been a negative 6%, leading to one of the worst inflation crises in its history [00:05:23].
*   **Europe and United States:** Similar mistakes were made in Europe and the United States during 2021 and 2022, with negative real rates of 3% and 4% [00:05:37]. While not as prolonged as Argentina's, these periods still had terrible consequences [00:05:48].

Many large investors fear a second, higher wave of inflation [00:05:55].
*   A study by the Apollo Group, a major private equity firm, suggests that inflation moves in waves and that when the Fed lowers rates, it tends to raise inflation, as seen in the 1970s [00:06:03].
*   According to this study, a new increase in inflation and negative real interest rates could occur again within 12 to 24 months [00:06:26].
*   This is further exacerbated by central banks' plans to reduce [[impact_of_interest_rates_on_the_stock_market | interest rates]] and governments' continued fiscal deficits [00:06:39].

> [!WARNING] Warren Buffett's Warning
> Warren Buffett stated in his 2024 annual letter to investors that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" [00:06:51]. He also warned that the effects of inflation can be enormous for the economy, and extreme inflation is always a possibility [00:07:06].

## [[investment_strategy_during_a_stock_market_crisis | Navigating Investments]] During a Reverse Crisis

During this kind of process, [[investment_opportunities_in_stocks_during_financial_uncertainties | investing in stocks]] has been more logical than bonds, as bonds tend to suffer in negative real rate environments, leading to a reduction in purchasing power [00:07:35]. However, not all stocks are equally beneficial.

There are two main approaches to tackling this problem:

### Strategy 1: Inflation-Sensitive Sectors

If high inflation is anticipated, certain sectors tend to perform best [00:07:53]:
*   Gold miners [00:07:58]
*   Real estate (REITs) [00:08:00]

> [!INFO] Bank of America Study
> A Bank of America graph indicates that bonds are the only investment category with a negative return in relation to inflation, while other sectors provide some protection [00:08:03]. However, these sectors generally have poorer performance compared to the market average in non-crisis periods, as they are often lower-quality businesses with higher volatility [00:08:18].

### Strategy 2: Warren Buffett's Approach - Businesses with Pricing Power

Warren Buffett suggests a different path: investing in businesses with strong brands and competitive advantages that allow them to have "pricing power" [00:08:35].

*   **Pricing Power Defined:** This characteristic enables companies to raise their prices at a rate equal to or greater than inflation, allowing their profits to grow faster than inflation and their costs [00:09:00].
*   **Benefits:** These businesses, listed on the [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | stock market]], tend to reflect this value creation and protect investors from inflation [00:09:19].
*   **Consistency:** Interestingly, these types of businesses have also performed well in the [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | stock market]] even outside of reverse crisis scenarios, offering consistent and predictable returns [00:09:26]. This strategy reduces the need to predict economic or central bank decisions, preparing a portfolio for various economic environments [00:09:37].

Based on a Credit Suisse table, a list of 25 large-cap stocks with significant pricing power includes iconic names such as:
*   Walmart [00:10:14]
*   Microsoft [00:10:16]
*   Campbell [00:10:16]
*   Philip Morris [00:10:17]
*   Dollar General (DG) [00:10:18]
*   Lockheed Martin (LMT) [00:10:18]

Warren Buffett has invested in many companies on this list that have shown strong performance over recent decades [00:10:21].

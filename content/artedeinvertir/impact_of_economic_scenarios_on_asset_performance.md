The "All Weather Portfolio," also known as the "Four Seasons Portfolio," is an [[investment_strategies_for_a_changing_economic_environment|investment method]] created by Ray Dalio, one of the world's most successful investors and the manager of the largest investment fund globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. This system aims to provide positive returns regardless of economic conditions, having historically given an average annual return of 7% and performing best when the stock market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Philosophy

Ray Dalio, considered an "outsider" in financial markets for his innovations, started managing $10,000 more than 45 years ago and now oversees over $130 billion in his investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. One of his key innovations is this portfolio management system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Initially private, its consistent and low-risk results led him to make it public to contribute to the investment community <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Dalio initially attempted to predict economic movements to make investment decisions, but found this approach unsuccessful due to the multitude of highly correlated [[impact_of_macroeconomic_variables_on_asset_value|economic variables]] that are difficult to predict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. He simplified the problem by identifying the two main variables affecting [[stock_market_behavior_in_response_to_economic_changes|stock market behavior in response to economic changes]]: inflation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. These variables can each be in two states (high or low), creating four distinct "economic seasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The "All Weather Portfolio" is designed to perform well in each of these scenarios, acknowledging that one cannot predict which economic season will occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Dalio likens the economy to the weather: we know it will rain, but not the exact time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Asset Classes and Economic Seasons

Ray Dalio recommends four main asset classes to build a resilient portfolio: stocks, bonds, commodities, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

### 1. High Economic Growth

In this scenario, two of the four essential assets perform well:
*   **Stocks** do well because corporate profits increase, leading to better stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
*   **Commodities** (like raw materials) increase in price due to rising demand and constant supply needed for construction, industrial goods, or human consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   *Example*: In 2019, large-cap American stocks rose over 30%, and commodities like gold (though gold isn't solely a commodity, it's mentioned here in this category) rose over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

### 2. Low Economic Growth

This less common scenario requires the portfolio to be prepared:
*   **Stocks** and **commodities** generally perform poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Bonds** do very well as investors seek refuge in these safe, conservative investments during difficult market times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
    *   *Example*: In 2020, during low [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets|economic growth]] due to the "current problem," 20-year American government bonds appreciated more than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.

### 3. Accelerating Inflation

When inflation accelerates, the [[the_impact_of_inflation_on_different_asset_classes|impact of inflation on different asset classes]] is as follows:
*   **Raw materials** and **gold** are the star assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Stocks** perform moderately well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>.
*   **Bonds** perform terribly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
    *   The philosophy of the Four Seasons Portfolio is to have some assets that excel in certain seasons while others merely maintain value or suffer small losses, ensuring overall satisfactory performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### 4. Downward Inflation

In a scenario of downward inflation:
*   **Bonds** perform quite well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.
*   **Stocks** also behave satisfactorily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.
*   **Raw materials** and **gold** do not perform as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>.

## Historical Performance of the All Weather Portfolio

The results of this [[investment_strategies_for_a_changing_economic_environment|investment system]] are compelling: over the last 30 years, it has produced losses in only four years, with the maximum loss being just 3% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. It has provided an average annual return of over 7%, allowing an investor to double their assets every 10 years without significant effort beyond buying and holding assets and annual rebalancing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

Its resilience during [[investment_strategies_for_economic_crises|economic crises]] is a major attraction, as it drastically reduces volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.

*   **2008 Financial Crisis**: The All Weather Portfolio experienced temporary losses of 12% between July 2008 and February 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. In the same period, the American stock market fell 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The portfolio recovered its losses in less than seven months, whereas the American stock market took four years to return to pre-crisis levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.
*   **2020 Crisis**: In March 2020, the portfolio's maximum fall was 2.3%, while the American stock market fell 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. All losses were recovered in just one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

This demonstrates the high resilience of this [[strategies_for_investing_in_volatile_economic_environments|investment system]] during crises or market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Replicating the All Weather Portfolio for Small Investors

Ray Dalio provides recommendations for asset allocation and how small investors can replicate these holdings using Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs). The portfolio requires annual rebalancing to maintain the original weightings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### Recommended Asset Allocation:
*   **30% in Large-Cap American Stocks**: Replicated by an ETF of the S&P 500 (e.g., SPY) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **40% in Long-Term American Bonds**: Replicated by an ETF like iShares Treasury Bonds at 20 years (e.g., TLT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
*   **15% in Medium-Term American Bonds**: Replicated by an ETF like iShares Treasury Pong (Bonds) at 3-7 years (e.g., IEI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This is particularly useful for small investors to access the bond market, which often requires higher capital for direct purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **7.5% in Commodities**: Replicated by an ETF like iShares Commodity Index (e.g., GSG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. This ETF includes diverse raw materials such as oil, aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **7.5% in Gold**: Replicated by the largest gold ETF, SPDR Gold Shares (e.g., GLD), which owns over $50 billion in physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Current Adjustments

While Ray Dalio continues to use his Four Seasons strategy for his investment funds, he is currently making certain changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. By observing his firm's public holdings (Bridgewater), it's evident he has slightly reduced the weight in bonds and reallocated it towards increasing exposure to gold and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

Specifically:
*   He has approximately 24% of his portfolio in large-cap U.S. stocks (through ETFs like SPY and IVV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:39">[00:13:39]</a>.
*   He is investing in international stock ETFs, including those from India (e.g., INDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   Over 6% of his portfolio is in ETFs from emerging countries or large-cap stocks from countries like Brazil or Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   His gold allocation (through GLD and another gold ETF) is now over 15%, double his original recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>.

These adjustments reflect a dynamic approach to [[investment_strategies_during_economic_instability|investment strategies during economic instability]] and [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations|economic cycles]], even within a foundational "all weather" framework.

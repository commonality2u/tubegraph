[[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Warren Buffett]] has recently stated that the next crisis is inevitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He has also provided new tips on how to adapt to the current situation of inflation and other identified risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. His latest major acquisition of shares was made to prepare for this upcoming event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## The Inevitable Crisis
[[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Warren Buffett]] stated that an inevitable crisis "should not surprise people" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. During an annual conference, he noted "substantial price increases with the issue of inflation" which are being accepted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. He specifically mentioned that "steel is going up every day" and the economy is "very overheated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

### Causes of Inflation
[[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Warren Buffett]] warned that inflation is currently higher and will continue to be higher than people anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>. He also warned of a "second wave" of inflation in 2023, when wages are expected to rise, updating with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. This wage increase, following current high inflation in 2022, will lead to another wave of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.

An example of this is seen in the difficulty companies like Walmart are having finding truck drivers, offering salaries up to $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>. Similarly, plumbers in the U.S. are also earning $100,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. This shortage in certain sectors, following recent confinements, translates into higher transportation costs for companies, which in turn raise their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

### Currency Devaluation
[[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Warren Buffett]] stated that the "easiest solution to the problem will be the devaluation of the dollar" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>, and the euro as well, since the same situation is occurring in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. This devaluation is a method governments use to address debt by increasing their income (through taxes on economic activity) while their debt levels remain constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

This means that investments in liquidity, such as dollars, euros, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits, are "very bad news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Warren Buffett]] noted that the dollar has lost "practically all its value in the last 100 years," specifically 99% since he was a boy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:00">[04:22:00]</a>. For example, $6.30 bought 17 oranges in the 1970s, but today you cannot buy that quantity for the equivalent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. Similarly, $20 bought 670 dozen eggs 90 years ago, but today in the U.S., $20 buys only 10 dozen eggs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Inflation is described as one of the "biggest scams" because while the money in an account appears the same, its purchasing power significantly decreases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. If people saw their bank balance visibly decrease due to inflation, they would "start a rebellion" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Largest Wealth Transfer in History
The situation of confinement has led to the "largest transfer of wealth in history," described as a "gigantic robbery of the middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>. Fiscal stimuli in the U.S. and Europe are financed through new debt and newly printed money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:00">[06:24:00]</a>. This debt will ultimately be paid by the middle class, as 90% of developed countries' income comes from this demographic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

Government spending from these funds, such as on roads and infrastructure, benefits companies that build them or provide digitization services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:00">[07:08:00]</a>. Companies like Amazon and Alphabet, or investment funds and consulting firms, benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>. This prosperity is reflected in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:00">[07:50:00]</a>. Therefore, if one is not investing, they will not benefit from this, but will still pay for the debt through taxes (VAT, gasoline taxes, income tax, asset taxes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. Money given to consumers for spending also flows through companies, which are the beneficiaries and best resist inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:49:00">[08:49:00]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts warnings about financial crisis | Warren Buffett]] stated at an annual conference that "all actions have consequences" and that printing money is not a sustainable solution to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. He found it "crazy" that 85% of the American population received $1,400 checks, especially when a few years prior, 50% could not save $400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>. The tremendous printing of money has caused debt levels of the four main global economies to rise from $15 trillion to $25 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts investment advice for inflation | Investment Advice to Adapt to Inflation]]

The only way to protect oneself in this environment is through investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>. This is evident in countries like Argentina and Venezuela, where high inflation forces people to invest to maintain purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:00">[11:02:00]</a>.

### Investing in Productive Assets
[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy during inflation | Warren Buffett]] advises against traditional "conservative" investments like bank deposits, fixed income, or treasury bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:50:00">[15:50:00]</a>. He compares buying a 10-year bond that yields 2% to paying 50 times earnings for a business that won't grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:00:00">[16:00:00]</a>. In contrast, a company like Visa, trading at 28 times earnings, offers an immediate 3% return and is growing profits at over 10%, leading to a total annual profitability of 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:16:00">[16:16:00]</a>. Therefore, conservative fixed-income investments "have a very complicated future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:02:00">[17:02:00]</a>.

### Gold vs. Productive Assets
Regarding gold, [[Warren Buffetts investment advice for inflation | Warren Buffett]] stated in a 2011 conference that owning an ounce of gold will forever remain just an ounce of gold, as it produces nothing and does not multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>. However, productive assets like stocks, real estate (houses, apartments), or farmland generate dividends and income, leading to better future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:35:00">[17:35:00]</a>. While gold tends to retain its value during inflation because it cannot be printed like fiat money, productive assets, especially well-managed companies, increase their value and share buybacks can further concentrate value for existing shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.

### Investing in Yourself
[[Warren Buffetts advice for inflationary periods | Warren Buffett's advice]] also extends to self-investment: "invest in yourself" and improve your skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. He stresses that the "best investment you can make is in education" to increase skills in any area, whether as a professor, architect, engineer, or worker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Being "above average" in your profession and adding value will lead to success, regardless of currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Recent Investments and Strategy Examples]]

To protect against inflation and adapt his portfolio, [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] recently made a large acquisition of $12 billion in shares, followed by another $5 billion investment in HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:39:00">[11:39:00]</a>. Notably, he did not invest "like crazy" in raw materials, gold, or energy companies, but rather in a technology company (HP) and a financial/insurance company (the prior $12B acquisition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. This aligns with his historical performance during inflationary periods, where he achieved average annual returns of 22% in the 1970s and 40% in the 1980s without investing in typical inflation hedges like gold or oil companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:43:00">[12:43:00]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett's investment strategy]] for inflationary environments focuses on "fabulous businesses" that:
*   Generate "tons of cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>.
*   Do "not require capital" or have "low levels of reinvestment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:47:00">[14:47:00]</a>.
*   Can raise prices without losing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   Have management that systematically buys back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:08:00">[28:08:00]</a>.

### Examples of Companies Meeting Criteria:
*   **HP:** This $40 billion company generates $6 billion in cash flow but only requires $580 million (10%) for reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:02:00">[26:02:00]</a>. This low reinvestment makes it resistant to inflation's impact on capital costs. HP also actively buys back shares, having repurchased $6 billion in the last two years, effectively withdrawing 15% of the company's stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:51:00">[27:51:00]</a>.
*   **Occidental Petroleum (Oxy):** [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett]] invested after hearing their conference call, where management discussed channeling earnings into share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:41:00">[28:41:00]</a>.
*   **Apple, Moody's, Bank of America:** These large positions in [[Warren Buffetts recent statements and investments | Warren Buffett's]] portfolio also systematically buy back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:09:00">[29:09:00]</a>.
*   **Starbucks:** Despite coffee price increases, Starbucks' high profit margins mean raw material cost increases have minimal impact on profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>. It reinvests around 20% of earnings and has a history of growing by raising prices above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:46:00">[37:46:00]</a>.
*   **C.H. Robinson (CHRW):** This logistics broker does not own trucks or airplanes, but rather connects companies needing transport with carriers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:10:00">[40:10:00]</a>. Its revenue is a percentage of transportation fees, meaning its income increases with rising transport costs (due to higher driver salaries and fuel prices), while its own operating costs (primarily technology and workers' salaries, which are less affected by unionization) remain low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:26:00">[41:26:00]</a>. It generated $1 billion in cash flow in 2021 but only reinvested $94 million (less than 10%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:49:00">[47:49:00]</a>.
*   **Google (Alphabet):** Generates significant cash flow (e.g., $146 billion in 2024 estimates) and reinvests a smaller portion (around 20-27%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:00:00">[51:00:00]</a>. It also actively buys back shares, repurchasing $50 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:30:00">[51:30:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Companies with low reinvestment rates (below 20%) are preferred, while businesses that are "capital intensive" and require 50-70% of earnings for reinvestment (like utilities such as Iberdrola, which reinvests nearly 70% of its operating profit) are avoided by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategy and market outlook | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:13:00">[27:13:00]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Outlook
The rise of stock markets and company benefits are normal given increased spending and reduced interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:26:00">[10:26:00]</a>.
The speaker notes that outflows of capital, especially in Europe, indicate fear, which can be a positive sign for the future when the trend reverses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:39:00">[21:39:00]</a>. Regarding interest rate hikes, "slow rate increases are more dangerous than slow ones" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:31:00">[22:31:00]</a>. The current period is a slow increase, and historical data suggests subsequent 12-month periods have seen 10% returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:34:00">[22:34:00]</a>. Even during fast rate increases, such as in the 1970s and 1980s, [[Warren Buffetts investment insights during market crises | Warren Buffett's]] results were "quite solid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:42:00">[22:42:00]</a>.

The increasing prevalence of [[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | passive and indexed investment]] strategies has significantly altered [[market_dynamics_and_investment_strategies | market dynamics]], contributing to more pronounced and rapid price movements in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>. This phenomenon is amplified by the theory of "markets without elastic," a concept that has drawn attention from prominent investors like Michael Burry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:45">[00:00:45]</a>.

## Markets Without Elastic Theory

The "markets without elastic" theory suggests that new capital entering the market generates a disproportionately larger increase in overall market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. While one might logically expect a dollar of new investment to create a dollar of market value, studies indicate a ratio of 5 to 1, with ranges from 3 to 8 dollars of value created for every new dollar invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Some theories even suggest this ratio could reach 10 to 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

This inelastic effect occurs because when the market is rising, there is high demand and a limited supply of shares, as few investors are willing to sell <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. This scarcity drives prices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

### Acceleration by Passive Investment

[[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | Passive investment]], such as [[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | index funds]], accelerates this effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Unlike [[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | active funds]] that may sell expensive shares to seek cheaper ones, [[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | passive funds]] are "agnostic to price" and do not consider valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:46">[01:14:46]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:01">[01:42:01]</a>. They are compelled to buy shares to maintain specific index weights, regardless of price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:50">[01:14:50]</a>. This mandatory buying, especially when other funds are also receiving inflows, drives prices up further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:07">[01:13:07]</a>.

This phenomenon has "distorted the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:18">[01:14:18]</a>. The rising prominence of [[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | passive investment]] (surpassing [[passive_and_active_investment_strategies | active investment]] by 2020) acts like "throwing gasoline on a fire," exacerbating the inelastic market problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:10">[01:18:10]</a>.

### Destabilizing Effect of New Participants

The recent influx of [[role_of_investment_funds_and_private_investors_in_market_dynamics | retail investors]] into the market, as seen with phenomena like "Reddit and Robinhood," has had a significant destabilizing effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>. This new money, often leveraged, amplifies the multiplier effect; a single dollar can be leveraged 3-4 times, which then, combined with the 5x inelastic multiplier, can result in a 20x increase in market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

This explains why the S&P 500 has almost doubled its price level in the last 3-4 years with a relatively low inflow of capital (estimated at $1300), generating $8 trillion in market value, a 5-8 times multiplier of the new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:50">[01:09:50]</a>.

## Consequences for Market Volatility

The "markets without elastic" theory works both ways: when money enters, the market rises in a very accelerated way, and when money exits, it triggers sharp falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. The same multiplier effect applies, where every dollar that exits can destroy 3-5 dollars of market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

This leads to [[market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | more pronounced movements]] and [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | increased volatility]], making the market behave like a "Formula 1 car" rather than a slow-moving truck <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:42">[01:18:42]</a>. Historical examples of rapid market falls and quick recoveries, such as in October 2018, summer 2015, and March 2020, illustrate this accelerated dynamic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:52">[01:19:52]</a>. This speed is further amplified by immediate access to information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.

Michael Burry has been warning about these market conditions and has been actively reducing his investment exposure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His portfolio has dropped significantly, with public positions representing a very small percentage of his total assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>. He has liquidated bearish bets on Tesla and bullish bets on Facebook and Google, seemingly preferring liquidity in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:50">[02:07:50]</a>. His actions suggest a defensive stance, moving towards more stable businesses like Lockheed Martin (defense sector) and CVS Health (healthcare sector) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:34:01">[03:34:01]</a>.

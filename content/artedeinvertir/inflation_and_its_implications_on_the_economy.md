[[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | Inflation]] is one of the four crises generating enormous volatility in 2022, affecting both the economy and global stock markets [00:00:04]. This new economic scenario is expected to affect everyone [00:00:15].

## What is Inflation?

[[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | Inflation]] is considered a dangerous risk [00:01:24] and is probably the most serious problem for all people, affecting everyone equally [00:05:43]. It is often referred to as "the tax of the working class or the middle class" [00:06:03]. While people might see the same amount of money in their bank accounts, the rising prices mean their money's value decreases [00:06:10]. It's comparable to having 30% subtracted from one's bank account, which people wouldn't tolerate directly [00:06:24]. Salaries might increase, but typically less than the rise in prices [00:06:33], leading to a significant decrease in wealth, savings, and income [00:06:40]. It acts as a "silent tax" imposed to finance economic recovery [00:09:54].

## Current State of Inflation

As of early 2022, [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] in the United States reached its highest figure in the last 40 years [00:03:35], [00:05:35]. For example, the average cost of a coffee in the US, which was 25 cents in the 1970s, is now $1.59, nearly ten times more [00:05:48]. This trend is consistent across many countries [00:06:01]. The current [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] rate is 7% [00:07:12], [00:30:08].

## Causes of Current Inflation

Several interconnected crises are contributing to the current [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] environment:

### Transport Crisis
A global logistical collapse has led to jammed ports and soaring transport costs [00:00:32]. The cost of transporting a typical container has multiplied five times, from $1,500-$2,000 to over $10,000 [00:01:00]. This results in supply problems and higher costs for goods, as producers raise prices to cover increased transport expenses [00:00:44], [00:00:51]. This situation has been described as "Armageddon" at the logistics and transportation level by Uber's head of logistics [00:01:26].

The crisis is exacerbated by factors like confinements, increased cases of illness, and a shortage of qualified workers in the transport sector [00:01:39]. Companies are forced to significantly raise wages to attract workers, which further impacts the prices of goods and services [00:02:28].

### Chip/Semiconductor Crisis
There is a severe global shortage of semiconductors, which the United States Department of Commerce has labeled "alarming" [00:12:46]. This crisis emerged because lockdowns led to a reduction in manufacturing capacity and some chip companies went bankrupt or redirected production [00:13:05]. When economies reopened, sectors like automobiles, which increasingly rely on chips, faced insufficient supply [00:13:26].

This supply-demand imbalance drives up prices, contributing to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] [00:13:42]. For instance, the price index for used cars in the United States has doubled as people cannot buy new cars [00:14:10]. Moreover, rising repair costs for vehicles (due to higher labor and parts costs) lead to increased insurance premiums for consumers [00:15:03].

### Energy Crisis
The world is experiencing a significant energy deficit, driven by factors such as tensions in the Middle East and the conflict in Ukraine involving Russia, a major energy producer [00:18:51]. The price of oil, for example, surged from $59 to nearly $94 in the last year, reaching seven-year highs [00:19:25].

This deficit is also due to reduced investment in oil extraction projects, which were deemed "dirty energies" [00:19:36]. Despite this, global consumption remains around 100 million barrels per day [00:19:54]. Renewable energies, being less predictable and having higher costs, cannot compensate for this deficit [00:20:04]. The soaring costs of electricity, which have multiplied four to five times in Europe, contribute directly to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] [00:20:54], [00:21:12].

### Monetary Policy
The extensive printing of money and maintaining low interest rates by central banks have also contributed to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] [00:09:40]. More money in circulation reduces its value, causing prices to rise [00:09:44].

## [[impact_of_inflation_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | Economic Implications]] for Consumers and Businesses

The most immediate implications of [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] are widespread:
*   **Reduced Disposable Income:** Consumers have less money to spend on goods and services as prices rise for transport, electronics, energy, and essentials [00:02:53], [00:21:14].
*   **Higher Costs:** Everything that requires electronic components or energy is rapidly increasing in price [00:16:51], [00:20:21]. This applies to daily consumption, food, and even insurance [00:15:27].
*   **Mortgage Increases:** Most mortgages, especially variable-rate ones in Europe, will see interest rates rise significantly, potentially increasing payments by 30-40% for many households [00:10:06], [00:10:29]. This affects a large portion of household spending [00:10:34].
*   **Reduced Business Profits:** Companies face squeezed profit margins due to rising energy costs [00:20:30] and higher input costs from transport and chip shortages [00:17:05].

## [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | Impact on Investments and Financial Markets]]

[[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | Inflation]] has significant consequences for financial markets:
*   **Stock Market Valuations:** Reduced business profits negatively affect stock valuations [00:03:08]. Additionally, if the profitability of bonds or [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] rises, stock market valuations tend to fall [00:11:01].
*   **Bond and Fixed Income Losses:** Investments considered "safe" like money in the bank, bonds, or fixed income are currently losing 7% of their value due to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] [00:07:04], [00:11:06]. Over 3-4 years, this could mean a 20-30% loss of money [00:07:17]. Holding liquidity in fixed terms or bank deposits is very dangerous as purchasing power declines [00:11:10]. For example, a bond bought for 10,000 euros that returns the same amount in 5 years may result in a deficit if expenses rise due to [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_purchasing_power_and_investments | inflation]] [00:18:27].
*   **Market Volatility:** The financial markets are showing signs of panic, with a trillion dollars in put options (used to protect against falls) being traded daily, reaching historic highs [00:16:10]. This reflects anticipation of future problems [00:16:44].

## Central Bank Response

The Federal Reserve (Fed), as the primary body legislating monetary policy, is increasingly concerned about [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | inflation]] [00:03:42]. Initially, the Fed minimized the risk [00:03:55], but due to the worsening situation, they called an emergency meeting to address the issue [00:04:00], which could specifically modify the [[macroeconomic_indicators_and_their_implications | economic scenario]] and stock markets for the coming months [00:04:16].

There is discussion of raising interest rates, potentially by direct increases of up to 1%, which has not happened for decades [00:08:06]. The last major unexpected increase in interest rates was in 2000, which burst the dot-com bubble [00:08:21]. Currently, technology stocks are volatile, and high-growth stocks are in a weak situation [00:08:28].

Other central banks, including the European Central Bank (ECB), are also considering interest rate hikes [00:09:04]. Governors of central banks in Europe are urging the ECB to end the policy of zero interest rates and easy money supply, as it is seen as a cause of [[inflation_and_interest_rates_impact | inflation]] [00:09:12].

## Mitigating Factors and Investment Strategies

The key to navigating this environment is to understand that not all investments are losers, and some companies can benefit from these crises [00:06:54].

*   **Investing is Key:** The only solution to combat [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] is to invest capital [00:07:02], [00:17:55]. The stock market, while having volatility, is often the most accessible option [00:07:27].
*   **Review Debts:** For individuals, it's advisable to review debts and consider converting variable-rate mortgages to fixed rates to mitigate the risk of rising interest rates [00:11:29].
*   **Think Long Term:** Many crises pass, and volatility will always exist in the market. It's crucial not to panic and make bad decisions during temporary losses [00:12:27].
*   **Analyze Benefiting Sectors:** Even in the worst crises, there are always assets or market segments that are benefiting [00:17:44].
    *   **Transport Companies:** Companies like CH Robinson, Periquitos International (which connect transport companies with clients), and rail transport companies (like Union Pacific) are benefiting from rising transport rates [00:22:11], [00:22:23], [00:23:06]. An example is Transforce International (TFII), whose shares have risen from $30 to over $100 since 2020 [00:23:30].
    *   **Chip/Semiconductor Companies:** Investing in ETFs that represent a basket of semiconductor companies (like the SOX index, which rose from $140 to over $460) can be beneficial [00:24:14]. Individual companies like Micron Technology (a memory manufacturer) and TSMC (the largest microchip producer) are also profiting from rising component prices [00:25:05], [00:26:19].
    *   **Automobile Companies:** Despite chip shortages, companies like General Motors, Ford, and Tesla are raising car prices, significantly increasing their profit margins [00:27:03]. Used car dealerships like CarMax are also benefiting from the inflated value of their inventory [00:28:12].
    *   **Energy Sector:**
        *   **Producers:** Companies like Canilla Natural Resources (CNQ), one of the largest energy producers in Canada, have seen their shares nearly double and offer dividend yields that exceed [[inflation_expectations_and_their_impact_on_investments | inflation]] [00:29:06]. Others like Hipo (an international petroleum company) show strong implied profitability at current oil levels [00:30:40].
        *   **Integrated Companies:** Companies like Shell, Total, or BP, which handle extraction, refining, and distribution, benefit from rising energy prices [00:31:28].
        *   **Exploration/Extraction:** Companies specifically focused on exploration, such as Turmalino, also perform well [00:31:46].
        *   **Support Services:** Companies providing engineering support, component parts, or accommodation services to the energy sector, like Lamberger or National, benefit from increased activity and costs [00:32:01].
        *   **Refining/Transformation:** Companies that refine oil or gas into derivatives like gasoline, such as Chinería Energy (a dominant player in liquefied natural gas), see profit margins increase as product prices rise [00:32:40], [00:33:46].
        *   **Electrical Distribution:** Typical electrical companies can raise prices for consumers, also benefiting from the [[the_impact_of_inflation_on_real_estate_and_investment_sectors | energy crisis]] [00:34:04].

For investments, it's crucial to seek assets that will have a return higher than the [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | inflation]] rate [00:30:01].

The current economic scenario suggests an [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | economic disaster]] that could lead to the total collapse of the financial system, as stated by [[Janet Yellens warning on the US debt ceiling | Janet Yellen]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. She warns that if a solution is not found in the coming weeks, it would cause irreversible damage to the [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | American economy]] and global stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. An exact date for this potential collapse, which would have severe consequences for both stocks and the economy, has been indicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## The Debt Ceiling Crisis

The United States operates with a fiscal deficit, consistently spending more money than it earns, primarily financed by issuing new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. For many years, a limit has been set on the amount of [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | debt the United States]] can incur, and this limit is currently being approached <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>.

### Initial Measures and Warnings
As the current director of the American Treasury, [[Janet Yellens warning on the US debt ceiling | Janet Yellen]] has begun taking desperate measures to manage the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Given that the [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | United States is at its debt limit]], significant cuts have been made to investments in pension and health plans, amounting to over $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Investments by the government for employee retirement plans have also been suspended, with resumption contingent on solving the debt problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

[[Janet Yellens warning on the US debt ceiling | Yellen]] has communicated to Congress that the American Treasury will have to take "extraordinary measures" once the limit is reached to prevent the [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | United States from going bankrupt]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. She emphasizes the uncertainty of these measures, providing only a limited time to maneuver <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>.

### Market Reaction
Financial markets are already pricing in a potential bankruptcy of the [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | United States]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. The price of Credit Default Swaps (CDS), which are insurance policies against government debt default, has multiplied by more than nine times for American government debt, indicating an enormous risk for financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:43">[00:03:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Consequences of a Default
A default on [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | American debt]] would lead to total chaos and a financial collapse, especially since the entire [[global_debt_crisis_and_its_economic_impact | global financial system]] is connected to American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:12">[00:04:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. American debt bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally, currently at $30 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect, impacting banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans that hold vast amounts of this "safest investment in the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This event would be similar to the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008, but multiplied by 30 times due to the significantly higher total debt balance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

### Projected Economic Impact
A White House report details the possible consequences of a debt default:
*   Over 2 million job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.
*   An additional cost of over $750 billion annually in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   Collapse of the dollar and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.
*   Stock market drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.

## The Trillion-Dollar Coin Solution

The most viable solution would be an agreement between Republicans and Democrats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. However, political divisions make this difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The proposed solutions have become desperate, including the idea of minting a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. The possibility of minting several such coins to temporarily solve the problem is being considered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Business Insider has reported on the American government's consideration of this desperate solution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.

### Legal Loophole
This seemingly outlandish solution exists due to a legal loophole in American law <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. While the [[Federal Reserves economic plans | Federal Reserve]] is the only entity that can print money out of thin air, and does so to buy government debt (e.g., during the 2020 crisis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>, the debt ceiling limits its ability to buy newly issued debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. However, American law allows the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:58">[00:07:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

The plan is to create these trillion-dollar coins, deposit them on the [[Federal Reserves economic plans | Federal Reserve's]] balance sheets, and use them as a checking account to continue paying government expenses and debt interest, thereby [[avoiding_debt_in_investments | avoiding bankruptcy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

### Consequences of the Coin Solution
While this solution might work in the short term, it would not send a message of stability to the financial markets due to its unserious nature for managing the world's richest country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. In this scenario, the value of the dollar, bonds, and stocks would continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:48">[00:08:48]</a>.

[[Janet Yellens warning on the US debt ceiling | Janet Yellen]] has warned that the American Treasury cannot estimate how much extra time these extraordinary measures will provide, but that they are likely to be exhausted before the first week of June <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:53">[00:08:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>. This implies that the collapse of [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | American debt]] could be just weeks away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.

## Protecting Investments
Investors are adopting [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_a_debt_crisis | strategies to protect their savings]] and investments against this new risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Many are starting to bet against the [[united_states_debt_and_its_consequences | US government debt]] and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### Potential Safe Havens
*   **Gold:** In such a scenario, the price of gold would likely rise sharply, serving as a safe haven, especially since its price is measured against the American dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. Gold-related stocks, such as mining or gold royalty companies, would also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.
*   **Credit Default Swaps (CDS):** Large investors with access to sophisticated products like CDS could buy this asset class to protect themselves from the risk of default <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETFs:** Inverse ETFs against the market, such as the ProShares Short S&P500 (SPY), rise in value when the market goes down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. However, these instruments have performed poorly in the long term, as the stock market tends to revalue over time, making them suitable for tactical short-term use during foreseen problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:39">[00:10:39]</a>.

## Historical Context
This [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | debt limit scenario]] was previously reached in 2011 and 2013, causing high market volatility even though temporary solutions were found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>.

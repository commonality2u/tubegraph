BlackRock, often described as the "owner of the world," is a powerful company that controls over $10 trillion in assets, making it the largest shareholder in major listed companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This asset control represents more than 10% of the world economy, surpassing the economic size of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## BlackRock's Influence and Business Model

Led by CEO Larry Fink, BlackRock's primary objective, like any private company, is to generate profits for its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Its clientele largely consists of banks, insurers, pension plans, sovereign funds from wealthy nations, and small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

### Control Over Financial Institutions
BlackRock holds majority positions in leading global banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This is a curious dynamic as many of these banks are also BlackRock's main clients, channeling more money to the company annually, which in turn increases BlackRock's control over major global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Many investment plans offered by banks may ultimately direct client funds into BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Even non-invested bank deposits can be invested by the bank for its own benefit, with a likelihood of some funds ending up in BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

BlackRock utilizes its commercial name, "iShares," to channel investments and own these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Its presence as a major shareholder is frequently observed in the top listed companies on the stock exchange, including those of large American banks like JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### BlackRock Solutions and Conflicts of Interest
BlackRock has a division called BlackRock Solutions, which audits and controls potential risks that major banks globally might pose to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This grants BlackRock access to internal accounts and data of these banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This situation presents a potential conflict of interest, as BlackRock is both a primary investor in these banks and responsible for assessing their internal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The company maintains that these divisions are separate, with "Chinese walls" in place for information control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

### Market Presence and Political Influence
BlackRock's power extends beyond the financial system; during the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve tasked BlackRock with dismantling failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. It is also a significant lender to emerging countries, further extending its control globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The company earns money primarily by advising on financial products such as iShares, with 80% of its income derived from this source <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. BlackRock saw an [[investment_opportunities_in_volatile_market_conditions | investment opportunity]] in creating ETFs that are easily traded like stocks, enabling the general public to invest simply in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Passive Investment Trends and Concerns

The rise of passive investing, particularly through BlackRock's products, has led to significant capital inflows into ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. In the United States, an estimated 60% of invested money is now passive, often in products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. BlackRock expects to continue growing at an annual rate of 15% through 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

### Concentration of Power and Competition
A major concern stemming from this [[passive_vs_active_investing_trends | investment style]] is the question of who truly controls companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Investors buying BlackRock products delegate voting rights to BlackRock, concentrating power in a few entities that control major global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This creates circular structures where client funds empower the company to control key entities, which in turn provide more funds, increasing BlackRock's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

This concentration of power also generates potential conflicts of interest regarding competition between companies controlled by a single entity like BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, BlackRock is a major shareholder in both McDonald's and its competitor Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This raises questions about free competition in sectors like the automotive, airline, and financial industries, where the same company controls leading players <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### Impact on Media and Corporate Governance
BlackRock, along with Vanguard, controls over $15 trillion in assets, which rivals the American economy's $23 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. These two companies are the main shareholders of 85% of the world's major listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. They also exert power in the media sector, controlling an estimated 95% of traditional or new generation media, including Facebook, where they are major shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>.

In 2021, BlackRock used its influence to pressure companies like ExxonMobil, a major oil company, to reduce its CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. ExxonMobil subsequently committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

### [[passive_investing_risks | Passive Investing Risks]] and Market Stability
The [[investment_strategies_passive_vs_active_investing | investment trend]] of simplifying investments by buying all listed companies through ETFs or passive funds is potentially creating a financial "non-bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Prominent investors like Michael Burry, who foresaw the 2008 financial crisis, have warned that [[passive_investing_risks | passive investing]] and ETFs represent a "huge bubble" due to the high valuations many companies are reaching, irrespective of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The mechanism of these ETFs forces automated buying of stocks that rise and gain relative weight in an index, further inflating valuations and attracting more passive capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. Burry warned that this [[stock_market_trends and_investment_strategies | investment style]] will falter when capital outflows exceed inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The larger the bubble, the more new money is required to sustain high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Inflation's Effect on BlackRock
Inflation could have a neutral or even positive effect on BlackRock's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. BlackRock charges a percentage on the value of its listed ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. If the nominal value of these ETFs increases due to inflation, BlackRock's commissions will be higher while its costs may not increase proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>. This phenomenon has been observed in stock markets of countries experiencing extreme inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:49">[00:10:49]</a>.

## Protecting Savings in a Changing Market

To protect savings, investors should take full responsibility for their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. It is crucial to understand where money is invested, the commissions paid, and the expected risks and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Given the complexity of the financial system, continuous education and training are essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

In a future where the majority buys all shares regardless of valuation, individual security selection may gain greater importance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>. This could lead to market discrepancies, with undervalued companies not benefiting from index inclusion and overvalued companies potentially performing poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

Investing in companies that consistently return earnings to shareholders through dividends or share buybacks is also advised <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. BlackRock itself has a history of increasing dividends and buying back shares, reflecting a focus on shareholder returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

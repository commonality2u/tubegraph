Cyclical stocks are those whose performance is closely tied to the overall economic cycle, often experiencing significant fluctuations based on demand and commodity prices. The oil and fertilizer sectors provide clear examples of such companies, where external economic and geopolitical factors can profoundly impact their profitability and stock valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:03">[00:20:03]</a>.

## Oil and Gas Sector

The ongoing conflict between Russia and Ukraine has significantly affected global energy markets. Germany's suspension of the Nord Stream gas pipeline certification, designed to bring Russian gas to Europe, caused gas prices in Europe to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>. This exacerbates an already high price environment due to supply crises and inflation, leading to higher energy costs and reduced consumer disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:38">[01:48:38]</a>. Oil prices, for instance, nearly reached $100 per barrel, up from $50 a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>.

Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers, accounting for 10% of daily global consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:56">[04:10:56]</a>. Even a small supply disruption, like a 2-3% gap, can cause disproportionate price increases in the oil market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:37">[04:37:37]</a>. Sanctions against Russia could further bottleneck global supply, severely impacting oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:02:18">[05:02:18]</a>. While a few oil-producing companies may benefit from these high prices, the broader economy is negatively affected by increased energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:16">[05:14:16]</a>.

### Gazprom: A Case Study

Gazprom, a Russian gas and oil producer, is listed on the stock exchange and has seen significant declines despite surging gas and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. This appears counterintuitive, as high energy demand should benefit the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:02">[01:54:02]</a>. However, the threat of excluding Russian companies from the Swift system, which would limit their ability to trade in major currencies, poses a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:14">[02:33:14]</a>.

Despite projections of earning $1.44 per share (approximately 115 rubles) in the current year, and trading at a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of 2.5 times with low debt, Gazprom is priced very low compared to global standards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:25">[01:34:25]</a>. The Russian stock market generally trades at an average P/E of only five times earnings, compared to 15-16 times in the US or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:48">[01:40:48]</a>. This lower valuation reflects investor concerns about Russia's political system and historical instances of property expropriation, where investors [[behavior_of_specific_companies_and_sectors_amid_crises | factor in that risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>.

### Investing in Cyclical Oil Stocks

[[comparison_of_investing_in_cyclical_versus_stable_companies | Cyclical stocks]], such as those in the oil sector, must be viewed differently from stable businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:03">[02:05:03]</a>. Peter Lynch, a renowned investor, advised that the best time to buy cyclical stocks is when their P/E valuation is highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:47">[02:09:47]</a>. This is because a high P/E often coincides with low raw material prices, meaning the company's earnings are at their lowest point in the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:07">[02:10:07]</a>. When earnings are expected to improve as raw material prices rise, the stock experiences an upturn. Conversely, when commodity prices are high, as they are now, the market assigns a lower P/E multiple, anticipating a future decline in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:11">[02:16:11]</a>.

## Fertilizer Sector

The conflict also impacts the agriculture and food industries, with food prices already rising due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:23">[06:53:23]</a>. Russia and Ukraine collectively account for approximately 20% of global grain and wheat production, and sanctions could further reduce this supply, leading to higher food prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:08:08">[07:08:08]</a>.

Furthermore, Russia and Ukraine are major producers of potassium, a key component in fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:31">[08:32:31]</a>. Fertilizer prices are already at critical levels, contributing to higher food costs and overall inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:03">[09:00:03]</a>.

### Mosaic: A Cyclical Example

Companies like Mosaic, which produce fertilizers, could benefit if sanctions prevent Russia from trading its fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:00">[02:19:00]</a>. As global demand for fertilizers remains, international companies unaffected by sanctions would see increased sales and prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>.

Mosaic's stock chart illustrates the typical [[companies_and_sectors_affected_by_economic_downturns | behavior of cyclical companies]], showing periods of significant price appreciation followed by collapses, with little long-term value generation over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:04">[02:33:04]</a>. For instance, in 2008, the stock soared, only to crash later, leaving investors who bought at the peak with substantial losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

### Investing in Cyclical Fertilizer Stocks

Investing in [[performance_of_different_sectors_during_a_recession | cyclical stocks]] like Mosaic is complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:50">[02:42:50]</a>. These are often described as "good for renting, not for investing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:59">[02:49:59]</a>. This means they are suitable for short-term speculation (1-2 years) but generally not for long-term "buy and hold" strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>. The optimal time to buy is when their valuations appear very cheap due to extreme negativity and low raw material prices, as this is when they tend to experience significant increases due to capacity destruction and subsequent price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:09">[02:50:09]</a>.

For example, the best time to buy Mosaic was in the summer or spring of 2020, when raw material prices were at their lowest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:06">[02:56:06]</a>. While Mosaic currently trades at approximately five times earnings, significantly below the Western market average of 15-16 times, this lower valuation reflects the cyclical nature and the market's anticipation of future changes in the commodity cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## General Considerations for Cyclical Stocks

*   **Volatility**: Cyclical stocks are inherently volatile due to their reliance on economic cycles and commodity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:58">[02:00:58]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Unlike quality growth stocks, which are often valued based on long-term profit growth, cyclical stocks require careful timing and understanding of the underlying commodity cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:06">[02:06:06]</a>.
*   **Risk**: While they can offer significant short-term gains, they also carry substantial risks if one invests at the wrong point in the cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:50">[02:42:50]</a>. This contrasts with companies like Adobe, a [[stock_opportunities_in_healthcare_and_technology_sectors | technology company]] with strong competitive advantages, which maintain profitability even when stock prices decline due to market sentiment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:00">[03:26:00]</a>.
*   **Market Sentiment**: Market downturns, often triggered by macro fears like conflicts, can create buying opportunities even for quality businesses that are otherwise unaffected in their fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:13">[03:52:13]</a>. However, for cyclical stocks, these events directly impact their core business.

The art of investing involves studying and modeling successful investors, particularly during periods of market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>. This approach allows investors to identify high-quality companies trading at attractive prices due to widespread market sell-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## David Tepper's Investment Strategy

David Tepper, a legendary figure on Wall Street, has one of the best track records in money management over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>. His firm, Appaloosa Management, amassed a fortune of $12 billion before he returned capital to clients to focus on his own investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Tepper has generated an impressive annual return of 25% for his clients, surpassing even Warren Buffett's performance in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>.

Tepper is known for his bravery in buying stocks during market panic when other investors are hesitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. His best years have consistently followed these periods of market distress, as he is able to invest at the most attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>. He publicly recommended investing in years like 2001, 2009, and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

In a recent interview, Tepper advised that while the market could fall an additional 10-15% if panic escalates, the approval of a package of measures by the US Congress could signal the end of the declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of investing only in "good companies" with solid competitive positions and low debt, as weaker, indebted companies may not survive economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Tepper predicted that many companies would be worth significantly more in one to two years than their current trading prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

### Tepper's Specific Sector Recommendations

David Tepper indicated he was buying stocks in the healthcare sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He also mentioned purchasing shares of large technology companies like [[analysis_of_recent_tech_company_performance | Amazon]], [[analysis_of_recent_tech_company_performance | Google]], and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. These technology companies meet Tepper's criteria of having strong competitive positions and low debt, suggesting they will emerge stronger from challenging economic periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Specific Stock Analysis: United Healthcare (Healthcare Sector)

One of the stocks that aligns with David Tepper's preference for the healthcare sector is United Healthcare (NYSE: UNH) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Business Overview
United Healthcare is a leading provider of private healthcare plans in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. The U.S. private healthcare market operates as an oligopoly, controlled by a few major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. This makes it a very defensive business; people rarely cancel their healthcare insurance even during an economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>.

### Resilience and Performance
United Healthcare demonstrated its resilience by increasing both sales and profits during the 2008 and 2009 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. Its return for shareholders has been impressive, with shares growing from $1 to over $240 in the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

### Financial Health and Valuation
United Healthcare maintains low debt on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Although a mature business, it is projected to grow at 5-10% annually for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

In the last year, United Healthcare earned approximately $15 per share, with projections indicating over $20 per share in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. High-quality, predictable businesses with low debt and a strong history like United Healthcare typically trade at a minimum of 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. Based on an expected future earning of $21 per share and a P/E multiple of 20, the target valuation for United Healthcare is over $400 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. This represents an attractive potential given its current trading price of $240 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

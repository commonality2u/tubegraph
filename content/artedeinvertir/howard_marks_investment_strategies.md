[[Investment strategies and philosophies | Howard Marks]] is a highly reputable fund manager in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:33">[02:54:33]</a>. He has a personal fortune of two billion, generated by investing his own money alongside his clients' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>. He is currently one of the world's largest fund managers, having surpassed Ray Dalio in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:05">[02:40:05]</a>. His company, Off Tree, manages 164 million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:05">[02:42:05]</a>.

Marks is renowned for successfully navigating various market periods, including both bull and bear markets, with very limited losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:05">[02:48:05]</a>. He started investing from scratch and built his fortune by managing money for others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>. His memos are considered very instructive, almost on par with those of [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:05">[03:03:05]</a>.

## Current Market Stance

In a recent article published on June 28th, Howard Marks stated that he is "starting to behave in an aggressive manner" regarding the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:05">[02:52:05]</a>. He believes it is "reasonable to start buying" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:05">[02:53:05]</a>.

> "It may continue to go down. In that case, I will buy more. I don't know when we will reach the market bottom." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a>

He emphasizes that even the best investors cannot predict the exact market bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:05">[02:56:05]</a>. His philosophy is to buy assets that are "cheap" and have good prospects, even if they continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:05">[03:09:05]</a>. He advises against obsessing over finding the market bottom, as this can generate anxiety and prevent investors from taking advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:05">[02:46:05]</a>.

He acknowledges that the market is not yet in a "valley" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:05">[02:31:05]</a>. However, he observes that assets within his circle of competence are cheaper now than they were 6 or 12 months ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:05">[02:51:05]</a>.

## Portfolio Holdings

Howard Marks' portfolio includes companies in:
*   Maritime transport <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:05">[02:54:05]</a>
*   Utility companies (calmer stocks for turbulent times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:05">[02:56:05]</a>
*   Financial stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:05">[03:02:05]</a>
*   Oil and gas producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:05">[03:09:05]</a>

Some specific companies mentioned in his portfolio include:

### Chesapeake Energy Holding
This company recently emerged from bankruptcy during a previous bearish oil cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:05">[02:57:05]</a>. It is a major gas producer in the U.S., benefiting from increased gas exports to Asia and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:05">[02:58:05]</a>. The company is expected to generate significant profits in the coming years and plans to return capital to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:05">[03:00:05]</a>.

*   **Cyclicality:** Chesapeake Energy is a highly cyclical company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:05">[03:13:05]</a>. Investing in cyclical companies is considered very complex for small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:20:05">[03:20:05]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** The valuations in the oil and gas sector are generally lower than for higher-quality companies like TransUnion because the market recognizes their lower quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:05">[01:21:05]</a>. Chesapeake's valuation has dropped significantly to six times earnings from eleven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:05">[01:54:05]</a>.

### Ally Financial (ALLY)
This is a spin-off company, formerly the financial arm of General Motors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>. Spin-offs have historically been an interesting investment theme with good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.

*   **Business Model:** Ally specializes in automobile financing and insurance sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:05">[01:17:05]</a>. It also operates Ally Bank, which attracts deposits by offering slightly higher interest rates, then lends out that money at higher rates for car loans (around 7% return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:05">[01:36:05]</a>. This business model has been growing and yields a good return on invested capital (ROIC) of around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:05">[01:06:05]</a>.
*   **Expansion:** Ally has expanded into investment management and mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:05">[01:22:05]</a>. Their client base in the U.S. has grown from 1 million in 2016 to 2.4 million clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Ally's share price has dropped due to fears about financial companies in an economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:05">[01:51:05]</a>. Its valuation is currently around 4 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 8-9 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. This low valuation is partly because it does not have an exceptional competitive advantage and operates in a market with many competitors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:05">[01:47:05]</a>.

Howard Marks loves [[Investment strategies and philosophies | investing]] in "unregulated oligopolies" because they are not constrained by government price controls, allowing them to maintain pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.

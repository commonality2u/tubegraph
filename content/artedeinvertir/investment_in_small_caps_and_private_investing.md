Investing in small capitalization (small cap) companies can offer significant advantages for private investors over large professional funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>. This is because large funds, which may manage hundreds of millions of euros, face liquidity challenges when investing in very small companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Consequently, these larger funds often cannot make certain investments that are very liquid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00">[01:08:00]</a>.

[[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | Small caps]] offer a huge advantage to [[advice_for_small_investors | private investors]], even more so than professionals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. A private investor can potentially generate higher returns than large funds operating with substantial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This is exemplified by the True Value Small Caps fund, which showed better performance compared to True Value when it started with a smaller capital base (4-10 million euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. It is much easier to invest with smaller amounts than with 100 or 200 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

Warren Buffett recommended investing in [[role_of_small_and_lesserknown_stocks_in_investment_portfolios | small caps]] and less frequent situations to achieve returns above 50% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. This approach was successfully adopted by the speaker as a private investor, leading to good results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.

[[challenges_and_trends_in_smallcap_investment | Challenges and Trends in Smallcap Investment]]
While small caps offer opportunities, some high-growth or "revolutionary" stocks can be quite expensive, leading to market euphoria in certain segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. In contrast, other market segments show pessimism and offer cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

Historically, successful [[investment strategies in small caps and favorable market segments | small cap investments]] have often involved companies where information was not readily available in English, making them less attractive to international investors initially. As these companies become more known, their valuations can increase significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:00">[02:22:00]</a>.

### Examples of [[investment_opportunities_in_smallcap_stocks | Smallcap Investment Opportunities]]

Here are some examples of small cap companies discussed:

#### IDT Corporation
IDT Corporation (ticker: IDT) is a company that the speaker's fund invested in when its share price was around $9-$12 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. The company has a strategy of using cash flow from mature businesses to reinvest in high-growth, disruptive technological businesses, and then spinning them off or selling them to larger corporations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>.

*   **Spinoffs:** IDT has performed six spinoffs, and if their value is added to IDT's performance, the average annual return for shareholders over the last 10 years has been 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:00]</a>. The historical stock chart may not reflect this due to unadjusted spinoffs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:00">[09:35:00]</a>. One such spinoff in 2014, involving telecommunications spectrum, multiplied its stock market value by 20 times in 2-3 years, growing from a very small capitalization to billions of dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model:**
    *   **Mature Business:** Traditional telecommunications services (e.g., international calls for immigrants, calling cards) generate significant cash flow (around $60 million annually) but do not grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>. This provides stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:14:00">[14:14:00]</a>.
    *   **High-Growth Businesses:**
        *   **BOSS Revolution (Money Transfer):** Impressive growth, over 100% year-over-year, competing digitally with services like Western Union <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:20:00">[11:20:00]</a>. Valued between $200-$400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:20:00">[16:20:00]</a>.
        *   **Point of Sale (POS):** Terminals and inventory management for small businesses, showing high growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>.
        *   **Net to Fone (Cloud Communications):** Offers low-cost digital telephony for businesses, growing at 42% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>. It focuses on niche markets like Latin America and Spain, where large US companies are less dominant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Despite a recent rise in price (60-70% in 2-3 months since purchase), IDT still appears cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a>. With a market capitalization of $500 million and $120 million in liquidity, the effective price for the business is $380 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:32:00">[15:32:00]</a>. The traditional business alone trades at roughly 6 times earnings, while a typical telecommunications business might trade at 12-15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>. The sum of its parts could value IDT at up to $50 per share, compared to its current price of $19 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:39:00">[16:39:00]</a>. The company has plans to list parts of its business, which is a positive catalyst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:30:00">[19:30:00]</a>.

#### Cedon
Cedon, described as the "Amazon of Sweden," is another successful small cap investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:21:00">[21:21:00]</a>. It was acquired as a spinoff from another Swedish company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:32:00">[21:32:00]</a>.

*   **Initial Undervaluation:** When purchased by the fund, it was worth only 150 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:50:00">[21:50:00]</a>. European or international spinoffs often list at very attractive multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:03:00">[22:03:00]</a>. A key reason for its undervaluation was that most information was in Swedish, deterring international investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:09:00">[22:09:00]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Cedon started with a traditional 1P (first-party) sales model but has successfully pivoted to a more profitable marketplace (3P) model, similar to Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:16:00">[25:16:00]</a>. In the marketplace model, third-party sellers send inventory to Cedon, which manages and sells it, charging a commission (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:26:00">[24:26:00]</a>. This reduces inventory risk for Cedon and increases profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:48:00">[24:48:00]</a>. The marketplace part is growing significantly (60% year-over-year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:38:00">[25:38:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Valuation:** E-commerce penetration in Nordic countries is still low, indicating potential for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:09:00">[26:09:00]</a>. Cedon is valued based on Gross Merchant Value (GMV), which represents the total value of goods sold on its platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:33:00">[26:33:00]</a>. While some similar companies trade at 5-10 times GMV, Cedon was trading at a cheaper multiple when the fund invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:55:00">[26:55:00]</a>. The company generates positive profits, and its operating leverage means that a 60% growth in sales can lead to a 300% increase in EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:31:00">[27:31:00]</a>.

#### Nagarro
Nagarro, a computer engineering company, is another example of a successful small cap investment for the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:43:00">[32:43:00]</a>. It is a spinoff listed in Germany <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:55:00">[33:55:00]</a>.

*   **Business Model:** Nagarro operates an "offshore" model, hiring engineers in regions like Latin America and India where labor costs are lower than in Europe or the US, while maintaining high quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:45:00">[51:45:00]</a>. This model allows them to offer competitive prices for services like creating online banking applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:00:00">[52:00:00]</a>. This business model is taking significant market share from traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:41:00">[52:41:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Valuation:** Nagarro has seen impressive growth, with turnover increasing from 200 million to 400 million in just two years (2017-2019) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:55:00">[55:55:00]</a>. The company expects at least 15% growth for 2021, projecting 500 million in turnover and 80-90 million in EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:04:00">[56:04:00]</a>. Founders and a founding family hold significant shares (15% and 40% respectively), aligning their interests with the company's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:22:00">[55:22:00]</a>. When valued conservatively (30-40 times earnings), Nagarro shows significant upside potential compared to its current trading price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:41:00">[58:41:00]</a>.

### Other Companies Mentioned

*   **IPCO:** A small oil company that is currently undervalued, trading at about four times earnings. It produces $100-$150 million in profit annually, with a capitalization of $400 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:37:00">[43:37:00]</a>.
*   **Apig Group:** A holding company involved in installation and maintenance of fire alarm systems, electrical installations, and liquid waste management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>. Approximately 80% of its income is stable and recurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:03">[01:08:03]</a>. It was initially an SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   **Nomad Foods:** A company selling frozen products in Europe, known for its stable market segment and slow but steady growth through acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:20">[01:10:20]</a>. It generates good free cash flow and is considered cheap for its sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11:00">[01:11:11:00]</a>.

### [[analysis_of_investment_strategies_for_private_investors | Investment Strategies for Private Investors]]

*   **Focus on Understanding:** It's crucial for investors to deeply understand what they are investing in, rather than just following trends or past performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>. Understanding a business means having a clear vision of its future sales, profits, and competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:17">[01:41:17]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** For new investors, building a balanced portfolio of at least 10-15 (ideally 20-25) companies is a safe way to start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:18">[01:13:18]</a>. This strategy helps manage risk, as not every individual stock will perform perfectly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:31">[01:13:31]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View:** Investments should be viewed with a 3-5 year horizon, focusing on potential average growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:01">[01:12:01]</a>. The market on average returns about 8% annually, so look for opportunities with higher expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.
*   **Patience and Emotional Control:** Volatility is a normal part of the stock market. Investors should not overreact to market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:25">[01:19:25]</a>. Maintaining some liquidity (10-20% of funds) can allow for buying opportunities during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>.
*   **Avoid Hype and Speculation:** Be cautious of companies with zero sales, unproven technology, or those trading at extremely high multiples without profits, as these often involve significant speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>. SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies), while providing a quick way to go public, can be risky due to less regulatory scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:00">[04:08:00]</a>.
*   **Recognize Market Dichotomy:** The market can be polarized, with some areas being very expensive (often due to speculation) and others being very cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:00">[04:47:00]</a>. Identifying and investing in undervalued segments can be profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that investing in the stock market can be a good mechanism to generate wealth, but it requires common sense, rationality, and avoiding greed or the desire to get rich overnight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:30">[01:15:30]</a>. It's important to build a good foundation through small victories to foster confidence and encourage further learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:50">[01:16:50]</a>.

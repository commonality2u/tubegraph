This article explores various aspects of [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investment strategies and portfolio management]], drawing insights from renowned investors like Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett, and offering guidance on [[the_art_of_managing_investment_portfolios | how to manage a portfolio]]. It emphasizes that the content is educational and not a buy/sell recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:07">[01:29:07]</a>.

## Current Economic Outlook and Market Warnings
Bill Ackman has issued a warning regarding the "bubble situation" currently experienced in the economy, particularly in stock markets and specific shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. He notes that the rise in interest rates can affect the current inflationary environment, which is the dominant force in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

According to a Reuters article referencing Ackman, the current market is a "classic witch fueled by easy money" from the Fed's quantitative easing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:09">[03:50:09]</a>. Now, there's a shift towards raising interest rates, creating two opposing forces in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:06">[04:06:06]</a>. This tightening of economic conditions is expected to accelerate, with potentially three rate increases by the Fed in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:03">[06:49:03]</a>.

Ackman believes central banks must immediately stop printing money, buying bonds, and interfering in the market, as these actions have caused speculative bubbles in many assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

### Affected Market Segments
The speaker highlights several sectors that have become speculative bubbles due to easy money:
*   Electric vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:00">[07:26:00]</a>
*   SPACs (Special Purpose Acquisition Companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, which were empty companies listed at $10 with the aim of acquiring a "hot" company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a>.
*   Renewable energy companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:29:00">[07:29:00]</a>
*   Cloud software companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a> (type disruptors) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>
*   Cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>

Many of these companies did not produce benefits and were valued at "stratospheric multiples," sometimes 40 times sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:27:00">[09:27:00]</a>. The speaker warns against expecting these "very great achievements" (like multiplying money by 13 or 20 times) to reoccur annually, as it's unrealistic and unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Investment Strategy
Bill Ackman manages a significant amount of money and his opinions are taken seriously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. His investment approach for 2022 focuses on protecting his [[investment_portfolios_and_analysis | portfolio]] against rising interest rates and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:40:00">[18:40:00]</a>.

His strategy involves owning:
*   **Predictable and resilient companies:** Businesses whose earnings can be understood and are resistant to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>.
*   **Companies protected from interest rate movements and inflation:** This means investing in businesses that can raise prices for their products or services when their costs go up, without losing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:20:00">[22:20:00]</a>. This is known as "pricing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:29:00">[23:29:00]</a>.
*   **Strategic use of derivatives:** Ackman uses derivatives to protect investments against rising interest rates, though this is difficult for private investors to replicate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>.

## Identifying Quality Businesses
To identify businesses with these desired characteristics, the speaker suggests:

1.  **Reviewing Fundamentals During Crises:** Examine financial data (e.g., income evolution) during past crises like 2008 (2007-2010 period) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:53:00">[25:53:00]</a>. Businesses that performed well during the "worst crises" tend to be resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="26:47:00">[26:47:00]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Stock Market Behavior:** While not technical analysis, applying common sense suggests that if a business has performed well on the stock market for 10-15 years, it's likely a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:08:00">[27:08:00]</a>.
3.  **Customer Reaction to Price Increases (Pricing Power):** Consider how customers would react if the business raised prices by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:09:00">[28:09:00]</a>. If customers remain loyal, the business has strong pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:36:00">[23:36:00]</a>.

### Examples of Businesses with Desirable Characteristics

*   **Domino's Pizza & Chipotle Mexican Grill:** People continue to eat pizzas or burritos even during economic downturns, making these predictable and resilient businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. They can raise menu prices to offset increased food costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.
*   **Nike:** Nike raises prices annually by about 5%, while inflation increases costs by 2-3%. This differential flows directly to profit, demonstrating operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:38:00">[24:38:00]</a>.
*   **McDonald's:** In the 2008 crisis, McDonald's sales dropped slightly by 3%, but its gross margins expanded from 38% to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>. This is because McDonald's primarily charges royalties and rents, which increase with inflation, while their fixed costs for already-bought premises remain the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:09:00">[36:09:00]</a>.
*   **See's Candies:** A business Warren Buffett acquired in 1972 for $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:45:00">[41:45:00]</a>. It's a prototype of a perfect business:
    *   **Resistant to crises:** People continue to buy chocolates for special occasions regardless of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>.
    *   **Easy to understand:** Simple factory, distribution, product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:46:00">[43:46:00]</a>.
    *   **No significant R&D needed:** The product remains largely the same over decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:02:00">[45:02:00]</a>.
    *   **Pricing Power:** Customers don't look at the price as much for occasional gifts, allowing price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:49:00">[42:49:00]</a>.
    *   This investment generated almost $2 billion in pre-tax profits for Buffett, multiplying his initial investment by almost 100 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:16:00">[46:16:00]</a>.
*   **Hilton Hotels:** Hilton primarily manages hotels and receives royalties based on hotel income, not owning most properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="52:37:00">[52:37:00]</a>. This allows their income to rise with hotel rates due to inflation, while their costs remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:53:00">[53:53:00]</a>.
*   **Lowe's Companies:** A large distribution store for home improvement products. Amazon tried and failed to enter this sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:32">[01:08:32]</a>. Most of Lowe's sales are recurring, driven by home maintenance and renovation rather than new construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.
*   **Adobe:** Software for PDF editing, video editing, etc. People pay for licenses and are unlikely to cancel if prices increase slightly, as the cost is minuscule compared to total company costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:40">[01:19:40]</a>. It's resistant to crises and has strong pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.
*   **Visa/Mastercard:** Offer convenience and security for payments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:47">[01:30:47]</a>. As an oligopoly, they can increase commissions without significant customer loss, as merchants will continue to pay to accept card payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:10">[01:31:10]</a>.
*   **Oracle:** Database management for companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. This is an "ultra-recurring" business where companies cannot do without the service <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:23">[01:26:23]</a>.
*   **Salesforce:** Cloud software with significant growth potential, benefiting from the expanding cloud sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:52">[01:39:52]</a>.
*   **GD (Getinge):** A medical technology company, very predictable and resilient to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:09">[01:43:09]</a>.
*   **Cellnex Telecom / American Tower:** Companies that install and rent telecommunication towers to telecom companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:38">[01:58:38]</a>. This is a good, growing business that will not suffer during a crisis fundamentally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:11">[01:59:11]</a>.
*   **Inditex (Zara):** A classic quality growth company that has experienced overreaction from the market due to interest rate hikes and management changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:12">[02:16:12]</a>. Its growth is stable (around 6-7% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:48">[02:16:48]</a>.

### Examples of Less Desirable Businesses

*   **Commodity Businesses:** These are cyclical and tend not to be good long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:55">[01:31:55]</a>. They lack a differentiating factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:10">[01:32:10]</a>.
*   **General Motors (Automobile Companies):** Thousands of alternatives for clients, leading to ruthless competition and preventing price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:15">[01:32:15]</a>.
*   **ArcelorMittal (Steel Manufacturer):** A cyclical, capital-intensive, low-margin business highly sensitive to the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>. Sales can drop drastically during a crisis, and profit margins can collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | Investment Strategies and Portfolio Management]]

### Core Principles
*   **Long-Term Focus:** The stock market is a good means of generating long-term wealth, but unrealistic expectations of multiplying money by 20 times annually are unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>. An investment should be held for many years, with a focus on survival; losing money is "game over" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:00">[01:09:00]</a>.
*   **Discipline and Effort:** While investing can be "comfortable" (e.g., clicking buttons, reading reports), it is *not* easy. It requires work, research, and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:00">[01:59:00]</a>.
*   **Self-Education:** Learning to invest for oneself is crucial, rather than relying on recommendations or following the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>.
*   **Understanding Business Value:** The key is to understand what a business is worth now and what it can be worth in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This means calculating the "intrinsic value" of an asset, which acts like a magnet for stock prices in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:07">[01:14:07]</a>.

### Portfolio Construction and Management
*   **Diversification:** For those not highly experienced, it's advisable to hold 20-30 different companies across different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:00">[02:05:00]</a>. However, diversifying into overvalued stocks (e.g., 40 times sales) doesn't reduce risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>.
*   **Concentration (for Experts):** Highly experienced investors like Bill Ackman might run a "high conviction" portfolio with only six businesses, managing billions in each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.
*   **"Coach" Mentality:** View your portfolio as a football team. If you assemble a good alignment of companies, the overall portfolio should perform well over time, even if individual stocks fluctuate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:32">[02:05:32]</a>.
*   **Adjusting Positions:** Make changes if a company is not generating value (like a coach substituting players) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:14">[02:06:14]</a>.
    *   **Selling:** Consider reducing positions when companies approach their intrinsic value or when a business deteriorates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:11">[02:07:11]</a>. Don't worry excessively about selling at the absolute peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:51">[02:13:51]</a>.
    *   **Buying:** Buy more when a company's stock drops significantly more than its intrinsic value has changed, or when there's temporary negative news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:21">[02:08:21]</a>.
*   **Position Sizing:** Individual positions should generally not exceed 15-20% of the [[investment_portfolios_and_analysis | portfolio]] to avoid excessive concentration risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:25">[02:07:25]</a>.
*   **Agnosticism to Macroeconomics:** Do not form a portfolio based on predictions about interest rates or inflation. It's difficult to predict macroeconomic futures; focus instead on companies that thrive in "any economic environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:45">[02:08:45]</a>.
*   **Patience:** Often, the best decision in the stock market is doing nothing once a good business is bought at a good price and analyzed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:44">[01:35:44]</a>.
*   **Learning from Mistakes:** It's a common mistake to sell companies that generate value too soon because of short-term pullbacks (20-30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:01">[02:15:01]</a>.

## Conclusion
[[investment_education_and_strategies | Investment education and strategies]] are crucial to navigate the market effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. The knowledge and experience gained are intangible assets that provide a competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:17">[02:19:17]</a>. While the market has volatility and risks, a sensible long-term approach with common sense can lead to a good experience and positive financial outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:27">[02:25:27]</a>. Avoid "short-cuts" like trading alerts or robots, as these are unlikely to lead to sustainable success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:44">[02:22:44]</a>.

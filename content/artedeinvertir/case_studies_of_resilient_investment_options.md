When navigating an environment where the economy is weak or facing difficulties, it is crucial to understand how best to invest and what types of assets tend to be resilient during such periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This article explores economic indicators pointing towards potential slowdowns and examines specific [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | case studies]] of companies that have historically demonstrated resilience.

## Economic Outlook and Recession Indicators

The Federal Reserve recently published a document detailing changes in the economic situation and when a possible recession could start <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:00">[00:00:00]</a>. This document suggests a decrease in GDP, which is indicative of a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Currently, the market assigns only a 5% probability of this happening in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>, with the consensus being that the economy will grow between 1.5% and 3.9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

In contrast, in 2022, there was a 90% expectation of recession, which did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. This highlights that when everyone prepares for the worst, economic prudence is exercised, preventing excesses that could lead to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Private Sector vs. Public Sector Growth

A recent interview with a former US Economy Minister under Donald Trump, Scott Bessen, an [[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | successful investor]], indicated that the private sector has been in recession, even though the overall economy shows growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This growth is largely driven by public sector spending and investments financed by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. However, sustainable economic growth requires the private sector to be in a positive state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Currently, public spending is at record deficit levels, almost 2 trillion, significantly higher than the US objective of one trillion (around 3% of GDP), nearing 7-8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This level is generally not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. Efforts to reduce this deficit, though positive in the [[longterm_investment_strategies | long term]], can cause short-term volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### GDP and Inflation Forecasts

The Atlanta division of the Federal Reserve, which publishes GDP Now data, forecasts a 1.5% drop in GDP for the current quarter, a significant shift from previous predictions of 2.5% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This indicates an economic slowdown, supported by falling inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. While the US reports 3% inflation, real-time meters like Truflation indicate levels of only 1.5%, well below the Fed's 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>.

### The Yield Curve

Another key indicator is the yield curve, which has predicted almost all past crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>. The yield curve measures the profitability of 10-year bonds against 3-month bonds issued by the US government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. Normally, long-term interest rates are higher due to greater risk and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

An inverted yield curve occurs when short-term interest rates are higher than long-term rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This happens when central banks raise short-term rates to cool the economy and combat inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. The effect of an inverted yield curve is not immediate, typically taking 18 to 24 months for the economic slowdown to be felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This leads to rising mortgage costs, higher financing costs for companies, and reduced investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

Historically, every time the yield curve has inverted, a recession has usually followed within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>. The recession typically begins when the yield curve *disinvents* (stops going from negative to positive) and the Fed begins to lower short-term interest rates quickly to reactivate the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. The current yield curve has experienced one of the strongest inversions in a long time and is now beginning to disinvert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>.

## How to Invest in This Environment: General Advice

[[investment_strategies_and_advice | Investment strategies and advice]] for navigating a weak economy include:
*   **Avoid debt for investing:** Especially when the market is at its highest, it's good to have liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Rotate portfolio and leverage opportunities:** This is what major investors do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Invest in quality companies with recurring income and low debt:** These businesses tend to drop less in a crisis and can serve as a store of liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>.
*   **Have liquidity and long-term bonds:** Warren Buffett accumulates liquidity before corrections to take advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:54">[00:21:54]</a>. Long-term bonds, like the TLT ETF, can provide returns even if the market doesn't fall, and their value increases if the Fed lowers rates during a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
*   **Buy when there is fear and panic:** Most crises pass within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>. Buying when others are fearful, and prices are low, leads to the most profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.
*   **Don't fall in love with stocks:** Be willing to sell stable assets to buy undervalued opportunities during a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>.

## Sectors that Perform Well in Recessions

According to Fidelity, during a recession, sectors that perform best include:
*   **Stable Consumption:** Companies dealing with food, drinks, clothing, and other basic needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:12">[00:28:12]</a>.
*   **Utilities:** Water and electricity companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>.
*   **Healthcare:** The health sector is generally unaffected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

Conversely, Real Estate and Financial sectors tend to suffer more due to difficulties in accessing credit and reliance on debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>.

## Case Studies of Resilient Companies

### 1. Ahold Delhaize (Supermarket Company)

Ahold Delhaize is a supermarket company, listed in Europe but with most of its business in the United States, particularly as a market leader on the East Coast <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>. It operates with various categories, including premium, middle-market, and economical lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:04">[00:38:04]</a>.

*   **Crisis Resistance:** During the 2008-2012 financial crisis, Ahold Delhaize's stock remained largely sideways or saw only minor dips (e.g., from 11 to 8), while the broader stock market fell by 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.
*   **Financial Stability:** The company demonstrated profit stability and even growth during difficult periods. For example, between 2007 and 2011, profits per share grew from 0.70 to 1 euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>. It has consistently met its strategic plan objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:01">[00:39:01]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** Its significant scale (almost 100 billion euros in sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>) provides strong negotiating power with suppliers, leading to higher profit margins, especially through its own private label brands (45% of sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:05">[00:40:05]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** While Walmart (a larger, better-known competitor) trades at 38 times annual earnings with 4% EPS growth, Ahold Delhaize, despite growing at 8% over the last decade, trades at only 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:01">[00:42:01]</a>. This lower valuation reflects Europe's general undervaluation compared to the US market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:25">[00:45:25]</a>.

### 2. British American Tobacco (BAT)

BAT operates in the tobacco sector, which is considered stable consumption due to regular customer purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:32">[00:37:32]</a>.

*   **Crisis Resistance:** During the massive 2008-2009 global stock market crisis, where the market dropped 60%, BAT's stock fell by only 13% (or 10% including dividends), providing liquidity to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>.
*   **Financial Performance:** The company consistently maintained or increased profits during difficult periods. From 2007 to 2009, profit per share rose from 1 to 1.50, and it continued to earn more even when its stock price began to decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>.
*   **Business Evolution:** While traditional cigarette volume has decreased, price increases have compensated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>. New categories like vaping and oral tobacco are growing significantly (20% annually until 2030), with higher profit margins and lower taxes due to being considered less harmful <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. These new categories, initially causing losses, reached breakeven in 2023 and are expected to skyrocket profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>.
*   **Hidden Asset:** BAT holds a 20% ownership stake in ITC Limited, a major consumer company in India <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. India is experiencing high growth in consumer products, and ITC trades at high multiples (25-30 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:08">[01:01:08]</a>. This stake is valued at approximately 15 billion dollars, significantly impacting BAT's adjusted valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>.
*   **Shareholder Value:** BAT aims to generate an accumulated free cash flow of 50 billion by 2030, a substantial amount given its 60 billion capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>. It currently offers an 8% dividend yield and is reducing debt while buying back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** BAT is trading at historic lows of around 8 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 16-25 times, even though its business has been improving <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>.

### Other Companies/Sectors Mentioned for Resilience or Opportunity

*   **Healthcare Services (e.g., UnitedHealth Services, Levans, CNA, HCA, Universal Health):** These companies provide basic needs and are generally resilient to economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:36">[01:19:36]</a>. Some are currently trading at attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **Constellation Software & Credit Acceptance:** Mentioned as companies with countercyclical features in fund portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.
*   **Puig (Fragrance Manufacturing):** A world leader in fragrance manufacturing for famous brands. Despite a high initial public offering (IPO) valuation, the business has strong competitive advantages and good returns on equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:46">[01:21:46]</a>.
*   **Google:** Listed as a large technology company with a strong business model, cash reserves, and reasonable valuation (PER 21) despite investments in Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:01">[01:32:01]</a>.

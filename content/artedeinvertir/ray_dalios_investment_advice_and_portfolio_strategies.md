Ray Dalio, a highly influential economist and investor, is the world's largest investment fund manager through his company, Bridgewater, which manages over $100 billion in assets, a figure greater than the Gross Domestic Product of some countries globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:36">[01:03:36]</a>. He has a proven track record of accurately [[ray_dalios_market_predictions | predicting major economic changes]], allowing him to safeguard his investment portfolios during significant crises like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2000 dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:44">[01:28:44]</a>.

Having achieved multi-millionaire status, Dalio has made his research on the economy public through his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:98">[01:44:98]</a>. He consistently warns that society must adapt to the coming [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | new economic scenario]] to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:24">[02:01:24]</a>.

## Impending Economic Changes and Risks

Ray Dalio has indicated an exact date for significant global [[changes_in_ray_dalios_investment_strategy | changes]], which will impact currency value (e.g., dollar, euro), real estate, [[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | inflation]], and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>. He describes this [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | new economic scenario]] as the most substantial societal and economic shift in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:13">[00:28:13]</a>.

He identifies three converging problems:
1.  **Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:13">[02:29:13]</a>: A recession coupled with significant social inequality, leading to societal and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:86">[02:32:86]</a>. Dalio notes that 90% of the American population owns less wealth, while a mere 10% holds 75% of the wealth in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The recent crisis (2020) exacerbated this, as governments issued massive debt to save the economy, which will be paid by the working class who haven't benefited from recent asset booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:92">[03:08:92]</a>.
2.  **Decline of US Competitive Advantage** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>: The United States, seen as a 75-year-old empire, is exhibiting clear signs of decline, particularly being in a terminal phase of its credit cycle by producing vast amounts of debt and printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Historically, the dollar's global dominance preserved its value despite debt issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>. However, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in GDP and global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>. He predicts that within [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions_for_2025 | five years]], foreigners may stop lending money to the US, and the dollar might not be as readily accepted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>.
3.  **Societal Conflict** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>: When difficult times arrive, society will fight among itself, with the poor seeking more from the rich, and the rich attempting to protect their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>.

Dalio's research suggests economies follow two fundamental phases: rise and decline, each defined by specific events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. His charts indicate the US is entering a decline phase characterized by high debt and alarming money printing, while China is in an ascending phase of wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Advice for the New Economic Scenario

Ray Dalio offers specific advice to protect savings and [[investment_strategies_inspired_by_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | investments]] in the coming [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | economic scenario]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:00">[06:18:00]</a>:

### 1. Avoid Holding Liquidity
Dalio emphasizes the importance of worrying about the value of money itself, just like the value of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>. Since money printing began, asset values (like stocks or gold) have risen due to new debt and money creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. He advises against holding what many consider "safe" assets like liquidity (cash), because extensive money printing leads to [[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | inflation]], which reduces purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. This compels individuals to become [[investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | investors]] in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### 2. Diversify Strategically
Diversification is key, encompassing countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The goal is to ensure that if one asset in a portfolio declines, another asset rises, maintaining the overall portfolio value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's All Weather Portfolio Strategy

Dalio's renowned "[[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | four seasons portfolio]]" theory, developed for his own investments, aims to create a portfolio prepared for both good and bad [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | economic times]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. His portfolio strategy recommends specific asset allocations:

### Recommended Asset Classes

*   **Stocks (40%)**: Dalio suggests allocating 40% of investments to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.
    *   **Emerging Market Stocks**: According to a JP Morgan study cited by Dalio, in an [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | economic environment]] with high but expected-to-drop [[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | inflation]] (like the current scenario), emerging market stocks perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:46:00">[09:46:00]</a>. Three of Dalio's five main investments are ETFs related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
    *   **Small-Cap Stocks**: Following emerging market stocks, small-cap stocks are the next best performers in the current [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | economic scenario]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Small-cap stocks have historically yielded over 17% annually under similar economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. They offer less market following, greater growth potential compared to large, established companies, and are less accessible to large investors due to liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Gold (Small percentage, under 10%)**: While traditionally recommended, in the current scenario, gold, liquidity, and raw materials are among the worst-performing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>. This can be achieved through ETFs related to gold mining companies or physical gold ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:21:00">[13:21:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds (Up to 40%)**: Bonds, including those protected against [[ray_dalios_inflation_warnings | inflation]], are recommended for their defensive properties, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. However, Dalio notes a "bubble" in the bond market due to government money printing and is applying a more conservative allocation to this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

## Overview of Investment Styles
Howard Marx's observations indicate a potential "transcendental change" in investment strategies, suggesting that approaches successful over the last 13 years may no longer be effective [00:29:56]. One key area of this shift involves the performance dynamics between large and small companies [00:01:20], an investment style that has changed significantly [01:17:41].

## Historical Performance
Historically, smaller companies have often yielded higher returns than larger ones [01:17:43]. This is partly because they are less followed by analysts, possess less liquidity, and have greater potential for multiplying their value over the long term due to their capacity for growth [01:17:51]. In the past, the [[investment_strategy_for_small_caps | small cap market]] typically generated between 11% and 12% annually [01:18:42].

However, the period following the 2008 financial crisis saw a shift [01:17:35]. While small cap indices like the Russell 2000 grew by approximately 50% over nearly a decade (an average of 4-5% annually), the S&P 500, an index of large companies, doubled, achieving around 9-10% annual returns [01:18:18]. This divergence was largely influenced by the era of "easy money" and significant capital flow into indexed investment [01:19:01].

## Current Trends and Future Outlook
There is a potential for a reversal in this trend, with smaller companies becoming more favored [01:18:44]. Currently, [[evaluating_smallcap_stocks | small companies are much cheaper than large companies]] [01:18:57]. This is supported by the observation that the withdrawal of liquidity from the system particularly impacts companies with less liquidity, creating forced sales unrelated to business performance [01:57:43].

## Key Differences and Investment Implications
| Feature             | Small Cap Companies                                 | Large Cap Companies                                |
| :------------------ | :-------------------------------------------------- | :------------------------------------------------- |
| **Visibility**      | Less followed by analysts [01:17:53]                | More coverage by analysts and indices [02:49:53]  |
| **Liquidity**       | Less liquidity [01:17:53]                           | More liquidity [02:49:51]                          |
| **Growth Potential**| More chances of growing; greater multiplication potential [01:17:56] | Slower growth as they are already large [03:03:00] |
| **Valuation**       | Often cheaper, especially in the current environment [01:18:57] | Can trade at a premium [01:41:16]                 |
| **Index Inclusion** | Not typically included in major indices [02:29:53] | Often included in main indices (e.g., S&P 500) [02:49:53] |

## Examples

### Grupegging (Small Cap) vs. J Maki (Large Cap)
Grupegging, a company producing packaging for the food sector, is a small cap with a market capitalization of 370 million [02:31:00]. It is not included in major indices, has low liquidity, and limited analyst coverage [02:33:00]. Despite stable, predictable growth (averaging 5% annually) and low debt, it trades at a significantly lower valuation compared to larger counterparts [02:46:00].

J Maki, a Finnish company also making plastic containers (e.g., McDonald's lids), is ten times larger than Grupegging, with greater capital and liquidity [02:44:00]. It benefits from the trend in indexed investment [02:49:55]. Despite similar growth rates (6% annually) and comparable earnings per share and debt levels to Grupegging [02:59:00], J Maki trades at a 60% higher valuation [02:59:00]. Historically, small companies were often listed at similar or even slightly higher valuations than large ones, reflecting their greater potential [02:00:20].

### GDI (Small Cap) vs. Compás Group (Large Cap)
GDI, a Canadian company providing building maintenance services (cleaning, gardening, security, HVAC) [02:28:00], is a small cap with very low trading volume, meaning it's not included in major indices [02:08:00]. It has demonstrated impressive growth, averaging 20% annually [02:29:55], even during the 2008-2009 crisis [02:50:00]. It maintains controlled debt [02:52:00].

In contrast, Compás Group, one of the world's largest companies in the building services sector, capitalizes at 30 billion dollars and is part of main European and UK indices [03:02:00]. However, Compás Group grows at a slower rate (6% annually) compared to GDI [03:04:00]. Despite this, Compás Group trades at double the valuation of GDI (26 times Free Cash Flow and 12 times EV/EBITDA, compared to GDI's roughly 13 times Free Cash Flow and 9 times EV/EBITDA) [03:07:00]. This [[analyzing_small_caps_investment_potential | valuation divergence]] exists simply because Compás Group is included in indices and is a larger entity, despite GDI's superior growth and future potential [03:07:00].

## Investment Considerations
While large companies have been favored by indexed investment and easy money policies in recent years [03:41:00], the current environment suggests a shift where [[benefits_of_investing_in_small_companies | smaller lesser-known companies]] that are not part of major indices could offer significant [[advantages_of_investing_in_smaller_lesserknown_companies | opportunities]] [03:33:00]. Investors should focus on [[understanding_companies_before_investing | understanding companies]]' fundamentals, such as profitability, cash flow generation, competitive advantages, and management quality, rather than simply following market sentiment or index trends [03:31:00].

This includes looking for "cockroach business models" that are resilient in various economic environments [03:49:00]. The current market situation, with a withdrawal of liquidity, can lead to disproportionate drops in [[evaluating_smallcap_stocks | small cap stock]] prices due to forced sales, creating attractive entry points for investors who understand the underlying business quality [03:55:00]. This is considered an ideal time to train and take advantage of these opportunities [01:19:18].

For example, Berry Global, a company in the industrial packaging sector, demonstrates consistent sales growth (11%) and profit growth (17%) with strong cash flow generation [03:59:00]. Despite its strong fundamentals and continued growth forecasts, it is currently trading at approximately eight times earnings, which is half its historical average valuation, indicating a significant [[differences_between_value_stocks_and_growth_stocks | value investing opportunity]] [04:09:00]. This contrasts sharply with the "growth at any price" mentality seen in previous years, which led to high valuations for unprofitable companies [03:19:00].

[[examples_of_highquality_companies_as_investment_opportunities | Examples of high-quality companies]] discussed that are resilient and offer good investment opportunities include GDI, Grupegging, Nagarro, and Berry Global [03:49:00]. These companies demonstrate stable business models, consistent growth, and reasonable valuations, despite broader market fears or lack of liquidity [03:55:00].

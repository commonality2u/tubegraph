The current economic landscape is undergoing significant shifts, leading prominent investors to adjust their portfolios and issue warnings about future market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This analysis explores different investment strategies and specific opportunities across various sectors, based on recent market movements and insights from renowned investors.

## Adapting to a New Economic Scenario

The investment world is approaching a new [[investment_opportunities_in_a_new_economic_scenario | economic scenario]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Ray Dalio, manager of the world's largest investment fund, has repositioned his portfolio defensively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Dalio, famous for predicting the 2008 financial crisis, navigates market crises with historically low losses and good returns when the market rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

Dalio's "new world order" concept warns of:
*   Tremendous political polarization in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   A rotation of world power from the U.S. to China, potentially causing future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   The possibility of the dollar ceasing to be the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   A change in central bank policy from "easy money" due to severe market consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   "Madness" in the crypto world and certain technological stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Investors must prepare for central banks no longer providing "free money," coupled with periods of high inflation and more difficult financial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. The Federal Reserve's stance suggests a potential 1% interest rate in the U.S. by July, implying four rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Recent inflation data was the highest in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

Ray Dalio anticipates future market returns of 3-4%, much lower than the historical 8-10%, and with significantly higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The world could change "alarmingly" in the next five years due to these financial, geopolitical, and internal U.S. struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Portfolio Adjustments

### Ray Dalio's Defensive Shift
Dalio has sold 90% of his shares and reduced weight in nearly 300 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. He sold shares from emerging countries and technology, as these are considered risky assets that tend to correct more during volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. His purchases have been in defensive shares like Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which tend to perform better when the market corrects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. This positions his portfolio very defensively, prioritizing action over words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

### Mark Leonard's Approach to Tech Valuation
Mark Leonard, CEO of Constellation Software, an admirer of Warren Buffett, applies a similar management style to the technology sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>. His company's stock has multiplied by 100 in 15 years, holding up perfectly during technology sector downturns because it has avoided overpaying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

Leonard advises that good technology businesses should *never* trade above five times their sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. He considers multiples below two times sales a good [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | investment opportunity]] for good, recurrent companies with growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Many popular tech stocks, despite recent falls of 60-70%, still trade at multiples well above this (e.g., Snowflake at 46x sales, Palantir at high multiples) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Portfolio and Independent Thinking
Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has seen recent movements, including a position in Activision Blizzard (later acquired by Microsoft) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>. Buffett has stated he never invested in Microsoft due to his close friendship with Bill Gates, to avoid misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Operations of less than $2.5 billion are typically handled by his sub-managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>. The Activision investment was likely made by these managers, as Buffett focuses on larger "elephants" (investments of $5-20 billion and up) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>. Furthermore, Bill Gates is no longer on Microsoft's or Berkshire's board of directors, acting as an external shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.

> [!TIP] Independent Thinking
> It is crucial to have independent thinking and verify all information, especially when following famous investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Check facts for yourself and understand the incentives of people giving advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:44">[00:22:44]</a>.

### Michael Burry's Investments
Michael Burry, known for "The Big Short," has bought several interesting shares:
*   **Bristol-Myers (Biotechnology)**: Trading at a multiple of 10 times earnings, below the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:13">[00:25:13]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics (Defense)**: Manufactures military equipment like nuclear submarines, facing virtually no competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. This technology is protected by the U.S. government <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:43">[00:25:43]</a>. It's a company with a high competitive advantage whose demand is non-cyclical, depending on defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>. The stock is considered defensive and is trading at its historical average, at around 15 times earnings when Burry bought it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Fidelity National Financial (Mortgage Insurance)**: The number one company in the U.S. for title insurance, which assures home buyers against hidden debts or problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. This is a very lucrative business with only 3-4 specialized companies dominating the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. As home sales recover, the company is doing well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Its valuation is at historic lows, around 8 times earnings, compared to a 10-year average of 14-15 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

### Bill Miller's Portfolio
Bill Miller, a legendary investor known for beating the S&P 500 for nearly 20 consecutive years, has invested in companies like ADT (alarm systems) and Mattel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:42">[00:31:42]</a>. He has also made significant money from Bitcoin and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.

Miller has added positions to:
*   **DXC Technology**: An IT services company that suffered greatly in the stock market due to an outdated engineering workforce and a high initial valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. Its valuation is now more reasonable, listed at only 8 times earnings, while other rivals are at 18 times or higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Miller's investment likely hinges on the business no longer being in decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:27">[00:33:27]</a>.

### Hyper-Concentrated Portfolios
Some funds maintain highly concentrated portfolios of exceptional businesses with huge competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:20">[00:34:20]</a>. Examples include Google, Microsoft, Visa, Facebook, and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

*   **Visa and Mastercard (Payment Networks)**: These companies form an unregulated oligopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. Recent results were spectacular, with profits growing over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:06">[00:36:06]</a>. Their "cross-border" business (commissions from international card payments) still has room to recover, providing a boost in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. They forecast average profit growth of 20-23% annually for the next 3-4 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. After recent drops, they are trading around their historical average of 31 times earnings, implying a future valuation of less than 20 times earnings by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>.

### True Value's Investment Philosophy
The True Value fund focuses on buying companies with a strong intrinsic value below their current market price, expecting that value to increase in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:19">[00:44:19]</a>.

*   **Humana (Healthcare)**: Published good results, exceeding market expectations and continuing growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
*   **Google (Alphabet)**: Despite good results and positive future prospects, the stock is trading 4% lower than when results were published, a typical behavior in a bear market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **MT Group (Restaurant/Food Franchise)**: A defensive business with good growth prospects, trading at a reasonable valuation of 9-10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Despite the pandemic's impact on restaurants, the U.S. segment is outperforming pre-crisis levels, while Canada's is expected to recover as restrictions ease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:27">[00:52:27]</a>. The company has prioritized dividends and share buybacks when acquisitions were unattractive, but the acquisition environment is now normalizing for resumed growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:19">[00:54:19]</a>. MT Group is currently at historical valuation lows, ignoring the March 2020 crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:35">[00:55:35]</a>.
*   **Facebook (Meta Platforms)**: Has continued to fall, reaching approximately 20 times earnings for a company growing at least 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:43">[01:31:43]</a>. Removing cash, its valuation is around 13-14 times profits, levels rarely seen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>. The online advertising industry is expected to continue growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:53">[00:58:53]</a>.
*   **SBB Norden (Nordic Real Estate)**: A "Nordic king" in real estate, considered safe for investment due to strong economies, legal security, and stable political systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:40">[01:15:40]</a>. The company issued bonds with a negative interest rate, meaning they were paid to borrow money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. The company's profits increased significantly in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:15">[01:16:15]</a>. Although rising interest rates affect real estate valuations, inflation also causes property values to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>. The company's book value is expected to be over 40 crowns by the end of 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:41">[01:25:41]</a>, and it typically trades around 1 times book value, which is considered very low for a company with high returns on equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>. SBB has hedges against interest rate rises for the next 4-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:41">[01:30:41]</a> and a plan to triple its size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:58">[01:30:58]</a>.

## Market Dynamics and Investment Opportunities

### High-Growth Stocks and Valuation
Many high-valuation companies, particularly those trading at very demanding multiples, have experienced severe drops (50-80% from highs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. This is due to a "new dose of reality" from the Fed and central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Examples of companies with significant corrections include Shopify (-61%), Block (-60%), and Roku <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Risk of Overvaluation
> In the current [[investment_opportunities_in_a_new_economic_scenario | new economic scenario]], owning expensive shares carries enormous risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:11">[01:09:11]</a>. When results are poor, drops of 20-30% can occur in a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:17]</a>.

### Bear Market Behavior
In a bear market, companies may publish good or even excellent results, but their stock prices either do not go up or may even fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. Conversely, if results are poor, sharp drops of 15-20% are common <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>. This differs from bull markets, where weak results might cause small declines, but good results can lead to significant gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:20">[00:46:20]</a>.

### Volatility as Opportunity
Market volatility presents [[evaluation_of_specific_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:35">[01:13:35]</a>. Astute investors capitalize on fear and panic, recognizing that short-term market reactions to news (e.g., a bad quarterly result) create chances to buy good businesses at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. While no one can perfectly time market bottoms, a strategy of buying as prices fall, given a conviction in the stock and no risk of permanent loss, is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

> [!TIP] Optimizing Entry Points
> When there are very large drops accompanied by extreme volume peaks (e.g., PayPal's profit warning), it can signal a potential short-term bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:08">[01:32:08]</a>. Waiting for volume to normalize after the initial panic can allow individual investors to optimize their entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.

### Impact of Interest Rates and Inflation
Rising interest rates, often a response to inflation, can negatively impact asset valuations, particularly in the real estate sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:57">[01:17:57]</a>. However, inflation itself can revalue assets, making real estate a good hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:14">[01:18:14]</a>. Central banks face a "trap" where raising rates too high could collapse the consumer economy due to high mortgage debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:42">[01:23:42]</a>. This could lead to an environment of "negative real rates" (interest rate minus inflation), where financial and real estate [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | investments]] tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>.

## Conclusion: Importance of Training

In the current volatile market, training in [[investment_opportunities_and_stock_market_analysis | stock market analysis]] is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>. Understanding how to value shares, monitor fundamentals, and make informed decisions independently is key to generating long-term wealth, rather than being a "stock market tourist" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>. Professional investors consistently earn returns by leveraging fear and short-term market thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. This environment is ideal for learning, as falling prices create [[investment_opportunities in equities | investment opportunities]] that may not be apparent to the untrained eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:12">[01:42:12]</a>.

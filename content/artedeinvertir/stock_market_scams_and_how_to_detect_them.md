The world of the [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | stock market]] and investments has become very popular in recent years, attracting many individuals who are new to these topics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. This increased interest has also drawn "unscrupulous people" who aim to acquire other people's money through complex deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is crucial to understand these increasingly sophisticated scam methods to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>.

## Recommendation Scams

One of the most dangerous scams involves [[recommendation_scams_in_investing | recommendations]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This method involves a scammer obtaining contact details for a large group of investors, for example, 10,000 individuals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>.

The process unfolds as follows:
1.  **Initial Split**: The scammer divides the contacts into two groups (e.g., 5,000 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. One group receives a recommendation for a stock (e.g., Amazon) to go up, while the other group receives the opposite recommendation, that the stock will go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Since the [[stock_market_volatility_and_strategies | stock market]] allows profit from both rises and falls, one recommendation will always be correct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.
2.  **Subsequent Splits**: At the end of the week, the scammer takes the group that received the correct recommendation (e.g., 5,000 investors) and divides them again into two smaller groups (e.g., 2,500 each) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. A new, different recommendation is sent to each of these subgroups (e.g., Nasdaq rising or falling) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.
3.  **Building Credibility**: After about four weeks, out of the original 10,000 individuals, a small group (e.g., 625 people) will have received a perfect recommendation week after week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These individuals will then believe the scammer possesses "miraculous abilities" in the [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

At this point, the scam begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>:
*   **Option 1**: The scammers demand a large sum of money for continued access to these "magical" [[stock_market_risks_and_strategies | stock market]] recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, the subsequent recommendations will produce "mediocre or below average results" because the scammers are not legitimate experts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
*   **Option 2**: They ask victims to deposit money into an account that will supposedly be managed with these "miraculous abilities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In this scenario, the deposited cash typically disappears within weeks, and the scammers cease all contact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>. Alternatively, they might operate the money through affiliated brokers of "dubious reputation," generating many operations and commissions, leading to the loss of all the investor's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

## Pyramid Schemes and Multilevel Systems

Pyramid schemes and multilevel systems applied to the [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | stock market]] and investments are another dangerous scam method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Victims not only lose money but often involve and affect their family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. The product or service offered is merely an excuse to comply with the law and avoid suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The scammer promises two main things to future investors:
1.  **Capital Safety**: Their capital will be "totally safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  **High Returns**: They will receive "high returns," such as 1% daily or 15% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

With these conditions, it becomes easy to attract people to deposit money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>. Additional conditions are usually set:
*   Money must be invested for a minimum period (e.g., 3, 6, or 12 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Bringing new people to the network leads to "exponentially higher benefits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

The secret to this system is that by blocking new participants' money, the scammers can pay existing participants who want to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This creates credibility, as initial investors can indeed withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. However, because everyone appears to be "earning fictitious money," few initially withdraw, allowing the pyramid to grow and affect thousands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The actual investments made by these schemes are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Scammers often use trendy assets like cryptocurrencies, gold, or certain stocks, but the money is not truly invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. Instead, victims are given access to online platforms with manipulated data showing their money "growing non-stop" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

These pyramids always end the same way: when more capital leaves than enters, panic ensues, and old investors cannot be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Everyone rushes to withdraw, realizing the scam, and the money is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Historical Example
In Spain, "Forum Filat√©lico" and "Afinsa" were pyramid schemes disguised as investments in stamps and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This scam affected over 190,000 people and swindled more than 2.5 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

>[!WARNING] Warning Signs
>If you hear terms like "network marketing," "multilevel marketing," "networks," or "pyramids," especially in the context of investment, "run away in the opposite direction" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. Pyramid schemes have been illegal for over 100 years in most countries, but they adapt by linking a product or service as an excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

## Trading Robots

Trading robots are another "ridiculous" scam that still exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. The proposal is simple: a computer program or algorithm supposedly operates automatically, generating "consistent profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>. Scammers often provide fake evidence like screenshots of bank statements or real-time trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

The fundamental flaw in this scam is obvious: why would anyone sell such a powerful, money-generating tool for a small amount, typically less than ten thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>? While algorithms *do* exist that can produce profits on most operating days, their owners are large institutions like Bank of America or JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. These institutions invest "enormous investment" in developing and testing them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. Such powerful algorithms are used exclusively for the bank's benefit, and even wealthy clients are not allowed to invest in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. For example, Bank of America's annual report indicates their trading algorithms profit 98% of the days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

The idea that an ordinary person could create an algorithm capable of beating those of major banks and then sell it for a mere $300 is "simply ridiculous from the start" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

>[!TIP] Recommendation
> "Just stay away from these kinds of products or algorithms" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These scams persist because many people believe the [[stock_market_risks_and_strategies | stock market]] offers "easy or effortless money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

## Fake Wealth Management Advisory Companies

These companies typically contact potential victims by phone, using high-pressure sales techniques and often employing women with pleasant voices to target a male audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

Their deceptive method includes:
1.  **Initial Contact**: The call starts friendly, presenting the company as reliable and having necessary permits to manage capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
2.  **False Demonstration**: If skepticism arises, they offer to open an account in the victim's name and deposit a significant amount (e.g., 20,000 euros) from their own pocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They promise to operate with this money to show their method works, assuring the victim that losing it carries no risk to them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. They even provide passwords for the victim to access an online platform and watch their "capital" grow in real-time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. These platforms and statements are often falsified, sometimes in cahoots with brokers of questionable reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
3.  **The Hook**: The supposed 20,000 euros in the account will "magically" grow to a much larger sum (e.g., 50,000 euros) in a few days, with a visible history of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.
4.  **The Trap**: A second call proposes that the victim deposit 20,000 euros into the account so the scammers can withdraw their initial capital, effectively transferring control of the now-50,000-euro account to the victim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>. Greed leads many to take this bait, believing they are getting a significant return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Outcomes of the Scam
*   **Disappearance**: Once the 20,000 euros are deposited, the company ceases communication and disappears if the victim tries to withdraw the 50,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Further Loss**: Even worse, some victims' greed leads them to deposit even more money, resulting in greater losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.
*   **Broker Collusion**: Sophisticated organizations may collude with low-reputation brokers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. The deposited money is moved through many operations, generating high commissions that funnel the victim's money to the organization and broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. They might also operate in derivatives where the broker is the counterparty, ensuring the victim's losses become the broker's or organization's profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>.

## "Smoke Sellers" / Supposed Experts

This recent trend involves "supposed experts" who claim to have an "infallible method" to beat the market, which they are willing to reveal for a "modest price" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. These individuals often display luxury items like Lamborghinis or homes, or photos of themselves trading from "paradisiacal beaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

They wrongly promise high returns with little effort and capital, claiming investors can generate a monthly salary with only 3,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Some even promise a daily return of 1%, which is "total nonsense" as it would translate to an annual return of 3,700% or multiplying capital by 37 times in a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. This would make someone the richest person on the planet in 10 years, which is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

These "experts" also "adorn their method" or training with awards from various organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Upon investigation, these organizations often grant awards to all their associates annually, making the awards meaningless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Another variant involves posing as a "professional investor," claiming to have managed funds in exotic jurisdictions like Panama or the Cayman Islands, where it's difficult to verify the information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Some claim to manage a "family office" to gain reputation, but this term does not have a legal figure in Spain allowing them to manage other people's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.

The reality is that these individuals usually lack the qualifications and experience to manage other people's money; they typically "make a living selling these supposed infallible methods or training" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## General Advice for Detection

>[!TIP] How to Avoid Scams
> The most important thing to avoid falling into these scammers' nets is "not letting yourself be carried away by greed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Understand that "no one is going to give you something in return for nothing" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
>
> Be wary of those who promise "high returns on the [[stock_market_risks_and_strategies | stock market]] without risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>, as this simply does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Your distrust should be even greater if you also have to attract new people to their "business opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
>
> When seeking a company to invest your money, look for entities regulated by the highest [[stock_market_trends_and_analysis | stock market]] authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For example, in Spain, this would be the CNMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The importance of [[the_importance_of_knowledge_and_training_in_investment_success | knowledge and training]] in investing is a recurring theme, with opportunities highlighted, particularly in volatile market environments [00:01:11]. The aim is to equip individuals, including small investors, with accessible knowledge to navigate complex market situations and build future returns [00:00:43].

## Investment Education and Training Opportunities

There are various [[investment_education_and_training_opportunities | investment education and training opportunities]] designed to help individuals understand how to make their savings profitable and engage seriously with the stock market [00:01:29].

### Course Structure and Content
Courses offer a practical method, including a comprehensive 100-hour program [00:01:22]. The curriculum is based on real-world experience and proven strategies from professional fund managers with established track records [00:19:00]. The goal is to provide a "cutting-edge" education not freely available online [01:08:50].

Key aspects of the [[introduction_to_investment_courses | investment courses]] include:
*   **Practical Learning** Emphasizes real, practical learning by focusing on current market functions and trends [00:30:51].
*   **Business Model Analysis** Teaches how to understand business models, identify risks, and study companies through examples [01:38:54]. This includes analyzing financial performance, growth potential, and valuation [01:13:09].
*   **Portfolio Management** Guidance on [[portfolio_management_and_investment_education | portfolio management and investment education]], including the philosophy of how professional fund managers analyze and understand businesses [01:06:55].
*   **Small-Cap Opportunities** Specific focus on [[investment_opportunities_and_stock_market_analysis | investment opportunities and stock market analysis]] in small and medium-sized companies, which may offer more profitable prospects due to current valuations [00:53:18].

### Benefits for Investors
Participants are encouraged to learn to conduct their own analysis, allowing them to apply principles to their personal [[investment_strategies and advice | investment strategies and advice]] [01:06:48]. The training aims to boost returns and take investments to the next level [01:07:46].

A crucial lesson imparted is the importance of understanding a business model and its risks [00:56:49]. Without this understanding, an investor risks becoming a "puppet of the market," prone to panic and poor decisions during downturns [00:57:15].

### Course Availability
Due to high demand, previous [[introduction_to_investment_courses | investment courses]] have quickly filled up [00:00:53]. Interested individuals can sign up for a notification list to be informed about future offerings, with the next opportunity anticipated before the end of 2022 [01:01:01]. A high satisfaction index of 97% is reported among students, and a refund policy is available for those who find the course unsuitable [00:53:46].

### Investment Philosophy
The overarching philosophy emphasizes that the stock market is not merely a casino, but a viable environment for generating profitability for those who understand what they are doing [01:55:53]. It encourages investors to think independently rather than being swayed by market "hype" [01:56:28].

A key takeaway is that an "excellent asset" is not always a "good investment," as a high valuation can lead to significant losses, even for fundamentally strong companies [00:55:11]. Conversely, an asset that appears "bad" might become an "excellent investment" if its price is sufficiently low [00:56:00]. This underscores the importance of being sensitive to valuations [00:55:17].

## Stages and Approaches to Learning Investing

Learning to invest involves different [[stages_and_approaches_to_learning_investing | stages and approaches to learning investing]]:
*   **Beginner Investor** For those starting out, it is advisable to seek companies with a predictable profile, characterized by linear growth and resistance to economic crises [00:13:13].
*   **Experienced Investor** Even experienced investors can refine their approach. An example cited is learning the discipline of not selling profitable, high-quality companies too early, even if valuations seem to have risen [00:38:33]. This is because fundamentally strong businesses continue to generate value over time [00:38:40].

## Professional Insights

Insights from professional fund managers emphasize that understanding a company's underlying business is paramount [01:07:33]. This involves looking at the company's fundamentals, debt levels, and expected growth [01:13:12]. While it is not recommended to simply copy the portfolios of large [[investment_funds_and_portfolio_management | investment funds and portfolio management]], learning their philosophy and analytical methods is valuable [01:07:01].

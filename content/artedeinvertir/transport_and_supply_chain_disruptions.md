Recent discussions highlight six main risks that could trigger an economic crisis in 2022, with [[transport_crisis_and_its_impact_on_global_logistics | transport and supply chain disruptions]] being one of them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. These disruptions are identified as a contributing factor to rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>.

## Causes and Characteristics
The current inflationary pressures are partly attributed to increased [[impact_of_oil_price_fluctuations_on_the_global_economy | transportation costs]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:07">[00:14:07]</a> and bottlenecks within supply chains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>. This includes issues like the [[semiconductor_shortage_and_its_economic_effects | microchip shortage]] affecting industries such as used cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:11">[00:14:11]</a>.

The transport sector, including air, road, and sea, is characterized by high fixed costs and a lack of control over rates, which are dictated by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. During an economic crisis, people tend to travel or transport fewer goods, making it difficult for these companies to raise prices due to high competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:05">[00:18:05]</a>.

## Price Increases in Transport
There has been a significant increase in transport prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:57">[00:28:57]</a>:
*   The Baltic Dry Index, which measures bulk freight transport, has seen substantial increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>.
*   The cost of containers has risen by factors of 4 to 5 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>.
*   Specifically, the cost of transporting containers from the US to China, a primary route for goods, has increased by approximately 10 times since March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:35">[00:32:35]</a>.
*   Global container transport costs confirm these rising trends across various studies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

## Implications and Risk Assessment
The rising transport costs have negatively impacted company profit margins, leading many to report lower-than-expected earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Lower corporate profits generally translate to lower stock market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:33">[00:33:33]</a>.

This [[transport_crisis_and_its_impact_on_global_logistics | transport crisis]] is largely considered a transitory risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>. The disruption stems from the destruction of transport capacity during lockdowns and the subsequent reopening of the economy, which supply has not yet matched <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:55">[00:33:55]</a>. It takes time to build or convert new ships and airplanes to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. The market structure changes are also taking time to digest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>.

While significant, this event is assigned a relatively low risk level of 3 out of 10 for causing a major economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:34">[00:34:34]</a>.

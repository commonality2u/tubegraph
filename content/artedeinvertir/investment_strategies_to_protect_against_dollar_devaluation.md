The global reserve currency, the US dollar, is reportedly beginning its decline, a process anticipated to accelerate due to recent decisions by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This devaluation is expected to affect economies and stock markets worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Even without direct dollar holdings, individuals may be impacted by its devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>.

<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> This article outlines [[strategies_to_protect_investments_during_inflation|strategies to protect capital and savings]] from accelerated dollar devaluation and highlights [[investment_strategies_amidst_potential_currency_changes|investment opportunities]] that may benefit from the dollar's potential end as a global reserve.

## The Dollar's Dominance and Decline

Currently, the dollar serves as the global foreign exchange reserve, influencing other currencies and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Data from the International Monetary Fund shows that 62% of the world's circulating money is in dollars, potentially exceeding 70% when considering dollarized economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

A significant contributing factor to devaluation is the aggressive creation of new money. In 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. This has led to a devaluation of over 10% against the Euro in just nine months since the crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

### Fiat Currency and Money Supply
Most major world currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. Before the 1970s, new dollars were backed by a specific amount of gold, which helped control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. This changed with the Bretton Woods Agreement in the early 1970s, giving the Federal Reserve the ability to print unlimited dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

The principle of supply and demand dictates that a drastic increase in the supply of new dollars will cause the currency's value to fall, leading to inflation and potential economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. However, 2020 saw an uncontrolled increase in the money supply (M2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. The Federal Reserve, under President Jerome Powell, has stated comfort with higher future inflation, implying further increases in the money supply and dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

### Historical Precedents of Currency Devaluation
Historically, aggressive monetary experiments have not worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.
*   The Roman Empire declined in value due to aggressive currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.
*   Germany went bankrupt after attempting to repay debts by devaluing its currency at the beginning of the 20th century <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Money had so little value that children used it as toys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.
*   Venezuela experienced disastrous economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, with devalued money being used for souvenirs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   Zimbabwe issued a 100 trillion dollar banknote, which can now be bought as a souvenir for $80 on eBay <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>. Money was transported in wheelbarrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

## Expert Warnings and Approaches

Major investors have warned about this potential problem.

### Ray Dalio
Ray Dalio, manager of the world's largest investment fund, Bridgewater Associates, has stated that the dollar will lose value and is selling the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He is considered the "Steve Jobs of financial markets" for his ability to anticipate economic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>.

In a Bloomberg interview, Dalio warned the dollar could decrease in value and cease to be the world's foreign currency reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He reported investing in gold, inflation-protected bonds, and stocks outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller
Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller, known for average annual returns over 30% for 30 years without losses, has aggressively been selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. In a CNN interview, he stated that the Federal Reserve's union with the Treasury during the crisis sets an unprecedented precedent since the Fed's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. He foresees increasing inflation over the next 5-6 years due to dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. Consequently, he is investing in gold and buying mining companies expected to benefit from increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Impact on Other Economies and Investments
Even for those outside the U.S. and without dollars, this economic phenomenon is likely to have an effect because other central banks are replicating the U.S.'s actions, significantly increasing the printing of Euros, Yen, or Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

If you hold money in fixed terms or uninvested, it will likely lose value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Similarly, [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties|fixed income]] or bonds are severely affected by rising inflation or currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

> [!INFO] General Investment Considerations
> An effective way to protect against currency devaluation is to invest in real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. However, this often requires substantial capital. Financial markets allow for investment with smaller capital (as low as four figures) and offer higher diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

## Five Ways to Protect Capital and Savings

Here are [[strategies to protect investments during inflation|strategies to protect investments during inflation]] and dollar devaluation:

### 1. Selling Dollars (Forex Market)
The most obvious approach is to sell dollars, as Stanley Druckenmiller is doing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:29">[00:07:29]</a>. This is done in the forex market, where one currency is exchanged for another (e.g., USD/EUR or USD/GBP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. A potential issue is that if the counter-currency (like the Euro) also devalues due to new money printing, the profit margin might be limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### 2. Investing in Gold
Gold acts like any other currency, but with the advantage that it cannot be created "out of thin air" like fiat currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. As the dollar devalues, the price of gold (denominated in dollars) tends to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.

Historically, investing in physical gold was complex due to storage and security costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. Now, investors can access physical gold through Exchange Traded Funds (ETFs) that buy and securely store gold on behalf of investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.
*   **Europe**: iShares Physical Gold ETF (ticker: SGLN) listed on the London Stock Exchange, appreciated over 40% in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
*   **US**: SPDR Gold Shares ETF (ticker: GLD) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)
As Ray Dalio suggests, [[strategies to protect investments during inflation|investing in bonds protected against inflation]], known as TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), can be beneficial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. If the dollar falls, inflation increases, and these bonds appreciate in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.
*   A simple way to invest is through ETFs like iShares TIPS Bond ETF (ticker: TIP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This ETF appreciated over 10% year-to-date in 2020 due to dollar devaluation and high inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### 4. Investing in Non-US Stocks
Investing in stocks outside the U.S. can mitigate currency risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. If U.S. dollar-denominated stocks are held, currency devaluation can offset gains from stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Ray Dalio has also chosen this approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
*   He invested $200 million in an ETF for emerging markets (ticker: EEM) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. This ETF invests in stocks of less indebted countries outside the U.S. that do not need to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

### 5. Investing in Large U.S. Exporting Companies
Investing in large U.S. exporting companies can be very lucrative during currency devaluation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:04">[00:11:04]</a>. These companies sell products abroad, receiving more valuable foreign currency, while their costs (denominated in dollars) remain the same. This increases their income and earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>.

#### Historical Example: Brexit
In 2016, after the Brexit vote, the British Pound plummeted over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. While the overall stock market initially declined, select large exporting companies in the United Kingdom experienced significant revaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>.
*   **Rolls Royce**: A UK-based manufacturer that exports its products, appreciated over 30% in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline**: Another large UK exporting pharmaceutical company, rose over 20% in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a>.

#### Current Examples of U.S. Exporting Companies
To identify U.S. exporting companies, investors can check a company's annual report for a breakdown of sales by region/country or use websites like Marketscreener.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

*   **ExxonMobil (XOM)**: The largest oil company in the world, listed at ~$38 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>.
    *   It benefits from two conditions against currency devaluation: producing raw materials (oil price rises if dollar falls) and exporting over 50% of its products outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>.
    *   ExxonMobil sells only 35% of its production in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:29">[00:14:29]</a>.
    *   The stock price dropped from nearly $80 to $38 due to low oil prices during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
    *   When oil returns to a normalized range ($50-$65), Exxon can earn around $4 per share and pay a $3 dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.
    *   Historically, Exxon traded at 15 times earnings. A target value could be $60 per share ($4 * 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
    *   Another valuation method for high-dividend stocks is historical yield (e.g., 4% for Exxon). This suggests a target value of $75 per share ($3 dividend / 0.04) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

*   **Pfizer (PFE)**: A leading biotechnology company, currently trading at ~$38 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:57">[00:16:57]</a>.
    *   Warren Buffett recently invested over $135 million in Pfizer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.
    *   Over 50% of its sales are outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>.
    *   It is a good business with consistently high ROE (above 20%) and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
    *   Pfizer expects to earn around $3 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>.
    *   The biotechnology sector historically trades at 18 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:35">[00:18:35]</a>.
    *   A target value for next year could be $54 per share ($3 * 18) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>.
    *   The company has growth potential and an attractive dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

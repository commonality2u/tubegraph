Ray Dalio, one of the world's most successful investors and the manager of the largest [[investment_opportunities_recommended_by_ray_dalio | investment fund]], developed an [[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | investment method]] known as the `[[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | All Weather Portfolio]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a>. This system, also translated as "The Four Seasons Portfolio," aims to provide positive returns across various economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Core Philosophy: Economic Seasons

Ray Dalio's `[[ray_dalios_all_weather_investment_strategy | investment strategy]]` is built on the premise that the economy, much like the weather, experiences different "seasons" that cannot be precisely predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. He simplified economic variables to two main factors affecting the stock market: inflation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. These can exist in two states each (high/low inflation, high/low economic growth), creating four "economic seasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The goal is to construct a portfolio resilient to any of these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

## Original All Weather Portfolio Allocation

To achieve resilience across all economic scenarios, Ray Dalio recommends an asset allocation primarily across four asset classes: stocks, bonds, commodities, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

### Recommended Asset Classes and Weights

*   **Large-cap American Stocks (30%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>: These perform well during periods of high economic growth as corporate profits increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   *Replication for small investors*: Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF tracking the S&P 500, such as SPY <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Long-term American Bonds (40%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>: These do well in periods of low economic growth and declining inflation, as they are considered safe and conservative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.
    *   *Replication for small investors*: Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF for iShares Treasury Bonds at 20 years, such as TLT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Medium-term American Bonds (15%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>: Similar to long-term bonds, providing stability.
    *   *Replication for small investors*: Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF like IShares Treasury Bonds at 3-7 years, such as IEI <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Investing in bonds via ETFs provides accessibility for small investors, avoiding the high minimum capital requirements of direct bond issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.
*   **Commodities (7.5%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>: These thrive during high economic growth due to increased demand, and especially during accelerating inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   *Replication for small investors*: Can be replicated by purchasing an ETF like IShares Commodity Index, such as GSG <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This ETF includes various commodities like oil, aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **Gold (7.5%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>: Gold is a strong performer during periods of accelerating inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.
    *   *Replication for small investors*: Can be replicated by purchasing the largest gold ETF globally, SPDR Gold Shares, such as GLD <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>.

### Portfolio Rebalancing

To maintain the desired asset weights, Ray Dalio emphasizes the importance of rebalancing the portfolio every 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This ensures assets return to their original recommended percentages in the `[[ray_dalios_all_weather_portfolio | All Weather Portfolio]]` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.

During periods of [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | economic uncertainty]], discerning [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | investment strategies]] are crucial for navigating market volatility. Insights from renowned investor Bill Ackman, among others, suggest that understanding macroeconomic shifts and historical market reactions can reveal significant opportunities. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a> This article explores key factors and [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | strategies for investing during economic uncertainty]] as the economy potentially transitions from a period of high inflation to one of weakening growth and potential recession.

## Current Macroeconomic Outlook

The economy is showing signs of weakening, with a possibility of entering a recession. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a> This weakening is evidenced by signs from companies in various sectors, including transportation, real estate, materials, and industrial firms. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a> While Q3 data in the United States showed spectacular growth, countries like Italy are on the verge of recession, Germany and the UK are already in recession, and Spain's growth is slowing. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> The latest data also indicates a significant slowdown in the United States. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>

This current crisis differs from those of the past 20-30 years, as it is primarily caused by inflation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>

## The Role of Central Banks and Interest Rates

Central banks, particularly the Federal Reserve (Fed), are expected to take action by lowering interest rates, which could stimulate the economy and be very positive for stock market investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> Historically, economic crises tend to coincide with the last interest rate increases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a> Following prolonged rate increases, central banks typically pause before eventually reversing course and lowering rates, as they realize they may have gone too far. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>

> [!NOTE] Good economic news for the real economy may be bad news for the markets, and vice-versa. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a> When central banks lower rates, it signifies lower financing costs, encourages investment, and fosters optimism, initiating a new economic cycle. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>

Bill Ackman predicts interest rate cuts could occur in the first quarter of 2024, much sooner than many anticipate. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:44">[00:16:44]</a> This shift would resolve the uncertainty surrounding financing costs for companies, which currently causes them to delay investment and debt. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>

### Impact of High Real Interest Rates
A high real interest rate (nominal interest rate minus inflation) can act like a "vacuum cleaner," drawing money away from the real economy and into financial assets like Treasury bills, which offer attractive yields with less risk. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:33">[01:10:33]</a> To stimulate the real economy, real interest rates need to be reduced. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:30">[01:11:30]</a>

## Historical Market Behavior and Opportunities

The stock market has historically performed very well in election years, with average returns higher than the historical average. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a> Politicians tend to encourage a strong economy and stock market to win votes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>

### Market Reactions to Rate Cuts
When interest rates are cut, especially without an accompanying severe recession, the stock market typically sees significant increases. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:32">[01:18:32]</a> Even if a recession occurs, the stock market often sees increases of around 10% in the following year. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:02">[01:19:02]</a> This is because the market anticipates future economic improvements due to lower financing costs. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:42">[01:19:42]</a>

> [!TIP] The market knows that when rates start to be lowered, it will be a trend for several months, reactivating the economy and leading to better conditions in the next 12-24 months. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:16">[01:19:16]</a>

## Identifying Penalized Sectors and Investment Themes

The current [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | economic uncertainty]] has disproportionately penalized certain sectors and types of investments over the past two years. These areas now present potential opportunities as conditions reverse:

### 1. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs)
REITs are highly sensitive to interest rates and have experienced significant declines. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a> Their valuations are currently at historical lows, similar to levels seen during the 2020 confinement and the 2008-2009 crisis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:22">[02:23:22]</a>

### 2. Small Caps
Small-cap companies have been heavily penalized, with their valuations reaching attractive levels of 11-13 times earnings, significantly below the normal average of 18 times. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:08">[02:29:08]</a> Historically, periods of low performance in small caps are followed by very good returns. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:28">[02:30:28]</a>

### 3. Fixed Income and Dividend Stocks
The value of bonds has dropped considerably, affecting dividend stocks inversely to interest rates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:04">[02:40:04]</a> When interest rates rise, dividend yields must rise to compete, which means stock prices fall. Conversely, falling interest rates will lead to rising dividend stock prices. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>

### 4. Cyclical Stocks
Companies sensitive to the economic cycle, such as construction, automotive, retail, airlines, and transportation, have been under pressure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:50">[02:50:50]</a> Despite recession fears, these stocks are starting to recover as bond yields drop, indicating investors are moving back into these previously uninvested and undervalued themes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:13">[02:54:13]</a>

### 5. Companies with High Debt (and Predictable Income)
Companies with high debt have been penalized, but this is less problematic for those with very predictable income streams. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:40">[02:54:40]</a> The market's fear of higher debt costs has led to disproportionate stock price drops compared to the actual impact on profits. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:19">[02:58:19]</a>

## Examples of Investment Opportunities

### Altria (MO)
As a dividend stock, Altria offers a high dividend yield of 9%, compared to its historical 6% yield. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:59">[03:50:59]</a> This adjustment reflects higher bond yields, but if interest rates fall, Altria's stock price would likely increase as its dividend yield normalizes. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a> Despite operating in a declining market (tobacco), Altria has grown profits and expanded into "smoke-free" products, maintaining a competitive position. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:55">[03:56:55]</a> The company also actively buys back shares, further increasing dividend per share. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:20">[04:00:20]</a> Its valuation has compressed from 20 times to 8 times earnings, despite solid fundamentals and growth projections. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:22:20">[04:22:20]</a>

### IWG (IWG)
Formerly Regus, IWG operates coworking spaces, combining real estate exposure with a small-cap profile and UK listing (which adds perceived recession risk). <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:37">[04:36:37]</a> The company's stock has collapsed by 65% since 2021, yet its revenue and earnings are almost back to pre-2020 crisis levels. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:57">[04:09:57]</a> IWG's business model has shifted from long-term leases to a "hotel management" style, partnering with companies that have empty office spaces. This capital-light model generates royalties and complementary service income, driving significant growth without large investments. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:01">[04:55:01]</a> The company aims to triple its size and is considering relocating its listing to the US for better valuation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:38">[05:07:38]</a>

### Berry Global (BERY)
Berry Global is a leveraged company (debt around 3.5x EBITDA) that produces packaging for predictable consumer products (80% of its business), such as food, health products, and household cleaners. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:28:40">[05:28:40]</a> Despite doubling its profits over the last five years, its stock price remains at similar levels due to market fears about its debt in a high-interest rate environment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:34">[05:34:34]</a> The company plans to start paying dividends and reduce debt, while outside funds are advocating for share buybacks, believing the stock is undervalued. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:08">[05:52:08]</a>

## Market Psychology and Investment Patience
Market behavior is often driven by fear and euphoria, leading to overreactions. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:59">[02:58:59]</a> There is currently a lot of money parked in liquidity, indicating significant fear in the market. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a> However, this pent-up demand can be released once central banks signal a clear shift in policy, similar to the market surge seen after the vaccine announcement in 2020. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:16">[01:14:16]</a>

> [!CAUTION] Investing in the stock market involves risk, and short-term volatility can lead to losses. However, with knowledge and a long-term perspective, and by taking advantage of opportunities, it can lead to good performance. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:01">[04:55:01]</a>

Ultimately, in the long term, business fundamentals are what matter. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:47">[01:41:47]</a> While the short-to-medium term (one to three years) can be unpredictable, patience is key for realizing returns from fundamentally strong businesses. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:54">[01:41:54]</a> The market is not always easy money, but it offers significant opportunities for those who are astute and educated. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:07">[01:42:07]</a>

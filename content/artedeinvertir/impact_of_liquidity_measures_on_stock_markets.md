Extraordinary liquidity measures have been approved, which are expected to have a positive [[impact_of_macroeconomic_variables_on_asset_value | impact]] on the stock markets in the medium and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>.

## Expert Perspective

Renowned investor David Tepper, known for his impressive track record over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>, commented on the potential [[impact_of_economic_cycles_and_stock_market_valuations | impact]] of governmental financial actions.

### David Tepper's View

Tepper noted that if the U.S. Congress approved a package of measures, it could signal "the end of the falls" in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. This interview took place when the S&P 500 was at 2200 points and the Dow Jones at 18,000 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The economic measures Tepper referred to were approved just two days later, on Friday the 27th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Investment Strategy

Tepper emphasizes that investors should not invest in just any stock, regardless of how much its price has dropped or how attractive the market price seems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. Instead, the focus should be on [[analyzing_companies_with_high_liquidity_and_growth_potential | investing in good companies]] because weaker, indebted companies may not survive challenging economic periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Companies with a solid competitive position are expected to emerge stronger, increasing their market share and profits once the economic difficulties pass <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. He expressed confidence that some companies would be worth significantly more in one to two years than their current trading prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

Tepper specifically mentioned buying stocks in the healthcare sector and large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. These companies meet his criteria of having a strong competitive position and low debt, ensuring their survival and potential to emerge stronger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Example: Airbus (AIR)

Airbus, despite being at the "epicenter of the storm" due to its connection to the airline industry, is presented as an example of a high-quality company with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. The commercial aviation business is an oligopoly dominated by Boeing and Airbus, a trend that has held for 50 years and is expected to continue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Airbus has a predictable business model with an order book of 8,000 aircraft, equivalent to 480 billion euros or seven years of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

Following Tepper's advice, Airbus's balance sheet shows a liquidity surplus of $12 billion, which is 20% of its market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. With normalized earnings of around 6 euros per share, and adjusting for excess liquidity, its valuation was very low at only 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Historically, high-quality companies like Airbus rarely trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. At a P/E of 20 times normalized earnings, the target valuation could be 120 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Over five years, with an estimated earning of 8 euros per share and a 20x multiple, the valuation could reach nearly 200 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

## Conclusion

The approval of extraordinary liquidity measures and strategic governmental actions are seen by experts like David Tepper as catalysts for a positive [[role_and_impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_the_stock_market | impact]] on stock markets in the medium to long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. The key investment strategy during such periods involves focusing on high-quality companies with strong competitive positions and low debt, as they are expected to not only survive but also emerge stronger from economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

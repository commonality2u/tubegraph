Bill Gates, known as one of the world's richest and most influential individuals, has recently adjusted his [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] holdings, selling off shares and expressing concerns about a potential future crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. While historically known for founding Microsoft, 60% of his current [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investments]] are diversified across a portfolio of stocks, demonstrating his expertise as an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:1:14">[01:1:14]</a>.

## Reasons for Investment Shift
Bill Gates' recent changes in his [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investment portfolio]] and public statements prompt reflection on the future of the economy and the [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>. He has a track record of accurately predicting significant events, including a pandemic and the company that would develop a vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Gates considers it "certain" that the world will experience an economic crisis similar in proportion to that of 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.

His portfolio adjustments indicate a cautious outlook, particularly regarding a global pandemic that could last longer than expected due to vaccine distribution inequalities, posing a significant risk to the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. Gates predicts a return to economic normalcy not until late 2022, contrary to a widespread belief of late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### The "Great Rotation"
Bill Gates appears to be positioning his portfolio for what is known as the "great rotation" of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. This involves a shift from:
*   **Selling Technology and Disruptive Stocks**: He has sold holdings in technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Apple, which were major beneficiaries of recent economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. He also sold Uber shares due to high valuation and fragility in an economic downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>, and Alibaba shares due to regulatory issues in China, which represent a "tail risk" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.
*   **Investing in Traditional and Defensive Companies**: While disruptive and technological companies have seen strong revaluations, more traditional and conservative companies have seen less benefit but now trade at attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Gates is concentrating [[evaluation_of_specific_investment_opportunities | investments]] in these more defensive companies, which are resilient to a potential [[investment_opportunities_in_uncertain_times | economic crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

## Key Traditional Investments

Bill Gates' portfolio reflects optimism towards traditional companies, including a recent significant [[investment_opportunities_in_highgrowth_stocks | investment]] in a high-growth stock.

### Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A)
*   **Weighting**: 43% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.
*   **Investment Value**: Over $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: BRK.A (listed in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $250 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Managed by Warren Buffett, a close friend, this business holding company is positioned to withstand "literally any economic environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. It's considered a very conservative and safe [[investment_opportunities_in_uncertain_times | investment]] against any crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Growth Prospects**: Estimated profit and book value growth between 7% and 12% annually for the next few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. Potential value could reach over $400 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### Waste Management (WM)
*   **Weighting**: 10% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>.
*   **Investment Value**: Over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: WM (listed in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $115 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: The leading US waste collection and recycling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It is a traditional company that is "very resilient to crises and very predictable in any economic environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The recycling market is expected to grow well above GDP, at 9% in the coming years, especially in North America where the company operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>.
*   **Growth Prospects**: Trades at a fair valuation of 25 times annual earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Has grown earnings per share at 10% per year historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Estimated value close to $200 per share in 3 to 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:19">[00:09:19]</a>.

### Walmart (WMT)
*   **Weighting**: 9% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: WMT (listed in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $135 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: The largest supermarket chain globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. It is a "very conservative company that can do well in any economic environment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>, offering moderate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

### Canadian National Railway (CNI)
*   **Ticker**: CNI (listed in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $115 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Railroad companies are considered among the safest [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investments]] in the transportation sector due to the difficulty of rivals establishing parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Railway remains a cost-competitive technology for transporting goods like raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.
*   **Growth Prospects**: Currently trading at a fair valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Assuming historical profit growth of 10% per year, its future valuation could reach $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.

### Other "Blue Chip" Holdings
Bill Gates also retains high-quality companies such as FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. These are considered "blue chips," which are large-cap companies known for providing adequate returns with few surprises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## Recent High-Growth Investment
Despite the focus on traditional companies, Bill Gates has made one new significant [[investment_opportunities_in_highgrowth_stocks | investment]] recently:
*   **Company**: Schrödinger (SDR) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
*   **Investment Value**: Over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Ticker**: SDR (listed in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $71 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Rationale**: Schrödinger is a highly innovative company that helps pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs and vaccines more efficiently through its technological platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. The US medical research and clinical trials market is valued at $47 billion annually, while Schrödinger currently bills only $150 million per year, but is growing at over 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:11">[00:12:11]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: The stock currently trades at a demanding valuation, over 40 times sales, and does not produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. This [[investment_opportunities_in_smallcap_stocks | investment]] is likely a very long-term play, with potential for significant growth if the company captures a meaningful share of its large market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

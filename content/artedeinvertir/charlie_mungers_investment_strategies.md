This article serves as a tribute to [[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]], Warren Buffett's long-time partner, highlighting his life and the investment techniques that contributed to his success [00:00:26]. Munger's wisdom has significantly influenced thousands of investors worldwide [00:00:13]. His life, particularly his early years, was marked by considerable difficulty, making his story a source of inspiration [00:00:42].

## [[charlie_mungers_life_and_challenges | Charlie Munger's Life and Early Challenges]]

[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] faced immense personal challenges in his early life [00:00:42]. At 29, he divorced, which left him in poverty, without a home, and struggling to care for his children [00:01:34]. Tragically, at 31, his only son passed away from leukemia, a devastating disease at the time with a very low success rate [00:01:45]. Munger would often leave the hospital crying because he lacked the money to pay for his son's treatment [00:02:11]. Shortly after, he suffered a serious illness, enduring terrible pain and losing sight in one eye [00:02:25]. Despite these economic and emotional hardships [00:02:36], Munger decided to study law, but ultimately found it unsatisfying [00:02:46]. He then transitioned into real estate and, more significantly, stock market investments [00:03:07].

Munger established partnerships, which functioned as investment funds [00:03:11]. Over 13 years, these partnerships grew from an initial $4 million (equivalent to $20 million today) [00:03:17]. During the 1974-75 crisis, his funds experienced significant losses, prompting him to close the fund and return client money once it recovered [00:03:27]. From that point, he resolved to only invest his own money [00:03:48].

By age 69, after enduring these struggles, Munger became one of the 400 richest people globally [00:04:16]. He was married for over 35 years to his second wife, had eight children, and many grandchildren [00:04:24]. He also became the Vice President of Berkshire Hathaway and [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | Warren Buffett]]'s partner and best friend [00:04:32]. Munger's partnership achieved an impressive 19% annualized return over 13 years, compared to the Dow Jones's 5% during the same period [00:05:07].

## Core Investment and Life Philosophy

### Don't Postpone Dreams
[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] emphasized not postponing dreams [00:05:24]. He noted that when young, people have energy and health, but often wait for "the ideal moment" or "perfect conditions" to pursue aspirations [00:05:54]. He regreted not catching a 100 kg tuna due to the physical strength required, illustrating that some things cannot be done later in life [00:06:12]. This applies to investing as well, where "paralysis by analysis" leads people to constantly search for the ideal situation, often citing economic problems like inflation or recession [00:06:43]. Munger, like [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | Warren Buffett]], learned that despite concerns, historic opportunities to invest arise [00:07:05]. It's crucial to "just go out there and start doing things" and adapt along the way [00:07:34].

### Have Low Expectations
Munger believed in having low expectations in life and investing [00:21:04]. He observed that high expectations, like imagining a glamorous trip, can lead to disappointment when reality differs [00:21:42]. Similarly, setting gigantic financial goals can cause frustration [00:22:15]. Instead, he suggested being enthusiastic, grateful for what one has, covering basic needs, and being a good person, which allows life and investments to pleasantly surprise you [00:22:29]. Lowering expectations in investments helps reduce stress and fear, counteracting the unrealistic desire to win every year in the stock market [00:23:20].

### Accept Volatility
[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] stressed the importance of accepting volatility, even in the short term [00:24:48]. He famously stated that if one cannot react calmly to a 50% drop in their portfolio two or three times in their life, they are not fit to be a stock investor and deserve mediocre results [00:24:51]. This is because the stock market does not move linearly [00:25:11]. Some of today's best investments, like Amazon and Tesla, experienced crashes of 98% and 50-70% respectively before their extraordinary revaluations [00:25:20]. Constantly trying to minimize losses leads to mediocre results [00:25:48]. If a good investment with a strong company is made and nothing fundamentally changes, market drops should be seen as buying opportunities [00:25:58]. Periods of market decline are much shorter than periods of economic prosperity and increases [00:29:12].

### Investment is Not Easy
Munger firmly stated that investing is not supposed to be easy, and anyone who thinks it is, is "stupid" [00:30:12]. He noted that all successful people he met read extensively and possessed vast knowledge [00:30:27]. There are no shortcuts in the stock market; a simplistic approach will only lead to losses or below-average results [00:30:36]. Success in investing requires curiosity about the world and how companies operate [00:30:57]. He himself left law to pursue investments because he found the activity genuinely enjoyable [00:31:10]. Munger also believed that the best help one can give another human being is knowledge [00:31:32].

### Control Envy
[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] highlighted that the world is not moved by greed but by envy, making it crucial to control feelings of envy [00:33:14]. While it's normal to feel envy, it must be transformed into motivation [00:33:43]. Envy in the stock market leads to poor decisions, such as chasing bubbles because a neighbor profited from a trending stock [00:34:24]. The average period of holding a stock today is just 4 months, compared to 8 years in the past, largely due to the constant flow of news and social media fueling envy [00:34:49]. Decisions made out of envy will likely lead to unsatisfactory results and unhappiness [00:35:22].

## [[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Munger's Investment Strategies]] and Examples

### Patience and Concentrated Investing
[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] advocated for extreme patience and concentrated investing [00:11:11]. He observed that typical investment committees analyze and buy a million things, leading to results that cannot beat the index or achieve significant wealth [00:11:40]. Munger posed the question: "Do you want to be more like me or more like them?" [00:11:26] This requires patience, letting many potential investments pass by, and continually studying methods to identify true opportunities when they arise [00:12:04]. He concentrated his investments in a few key holdings like Berkshire Hathaway, Costco, Daily Journal, and the Lilu investment fund [00:12:35]. Munger famously stated, "the money is not in the buying or selling, it is in the waiting" [00:13:06].

### Focus on "Compounders"
Munger emphasized investing in "compounders"â€”shares that grow their benefit at 20-25% annually for many years [00:13:14]. He explained that 95% of his and [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | Warren Buffett]]'s wealth came from just 20 good investments [00:14:35]. These investments shared common characteristics:
*   **Started as Small/Medium Cap Companies**: Companies that began with small market capitalizations have greater growth potential [00:14:51].
*   **High Growth Potential**: They must have growth potential significantly above 15% for many years [00:15:16].
*   **Large Potential Market**: Operating in a very large market allows for sustained growth, either by gaining market share or being in a rapidly expanding industry [00:15:21].
*   **Competitive Advantage**: A sustainable competitive advantage (e.g., unique product, scale, switching costs, network effect) is crucial to sustain high growth levels [00:15:35].
*   **Aligned Management**: A board of directors aligned with shareholder interests is important for returning capital effectively [00:16:12].

### Invest Against the Fads
Munger's approach often involved investing in sectors that were not currently in fashion [00:39:56]. He highlighted that constantly investing in "un-fashionable" assets has historically yielded much better results than chasing trends [00:39:56]. The key is valuation: when something is not in fashion, its valuation is often low, offering significant potential if the company continues to grow [00:40:31]. Conversely, investing in popular, expensive assets often yields less spectacular returns [00:40:47]. The market constantly cycles through favored and disfavored sectors [00:41:49].

### Notable Investments and Examples

#### Coca-Cola
[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] and [[investment_strategies_of_legendary_investors | Warren Buffett]] invested in Coca-Cola around the mid-1980s when its profits grew at 12-15% annually for many years [00:47:40]. They often described Coca-Cola as "the perfect business" [00:49:32]. Its key characteristics, which serve as a prototype for good businesses, include:
*   **Low Capital Requirements**: The business barely requires any investment, leading to high-profit margins [00:50:03]. This is especially valuable during inflation, as there's no need to constantly reinvest in expensive assets [00:50:08].
*   **Essentially Unchanged Product**: Coca-Cola sells a product that has been largely the same for 100 years, requiring very little research and development [00:50:23]. This contrasts with industries like automotive, which demand constant product renewal [00:50:52].
*   **High Profit Margin**: Essentially selling bottled liquid, Coca-Cola benefits from high profit margins [00:52:24].
*   **High Return on Invested Capital**: This allows the company to reinvest profits for significant growth over time [00:52:37].

While Coca-Cola is unlikely to multiply by 100 times in the future due to its mature market penetration [00:49:41], its characteristics exemplify a high-quality "blue chip" company with predictable long-term returns [01:04:32].

#### Daily Journal
[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]] used Daily Journal, originally a newspaper company, as his personal investment vehicle, where he implemented his ultra-concentrated philosophy [00:57:34]. The cash flow from the declining newspaper business was reinvested into stocks [00:57:40]. The Daily Journal's current underlying business is software and databases for the legal system and public administration [00:58:47]. Munger's portfolio within Daily Journal was extremely concentrated, holding only three stocks: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Alibaba (which he later admitted was a mistake) [00:57:52]. This meant 80% of the portfolio was in just two bank stocks [00:58:10]. He bet strongly on these financial companies because they benefit from rising interest rates and were out of fashion, trading at much lower valuations (e.g., 9-8 times earnings compared to historical 15-20 times) [01:00:27].

#### Fluran Decor (The "New Costco")
Munger identified Fluran Decor as having much in common with Costco but at an earlier, smaller stage [01:05:46]. Fluran Decor is a retailer of flooring and decoration materials, with a market capitalization of $10 billion (20 times smaller than Costco) [01:05:10]. The company employs a "everyday low prices" philosophy, similar to Mercadona in Spain [01:06:40]. Fluran Decor streamlines the supply chain by contacting manufacturers directly and handling import, distribution, and retail [01:07:33]. Their large industrial warehouse-style stores provide an efficient way for customers to visualize and purchase materials in bulk [01:07:47].

Despite the internet's rise, this business model has prospered, partly due to the tactile nature of the product and catering to professional clients who need immediate access and advice [01:09:28]. The company has rapidly expanded, opening new stores at an 18% annual growth rate, and each store's sales continue to increase by 4-5% [01:10:30]. This leads to profit growth of 37% annually, significantly higher than what a mature company like Costco can achieve [01:10:48]. Fluran Decor has substantial growth potential, currently holding only a 10% market share in a $50 billion U.S. market, with plans to reach 500 stores (triple its current number) [01:12:02]. Its new stores offer a high return on investment, with a payback period of just 2.5 to 3.5 years [01:12:17].

## Concluding Thoughts

[[charlie_mungers_investment_principles | Charlie Munger]]'s life and investment philosophy underscore the importance of patience, discipline, continuous learning, and emotional control, particularly in dealing with envy and volatility [01:31:00]. His strategies, though applied to different companies over time, consistently focus on understanding business fundamentals, seeking competitive advantages, and allowing compounding to work over the long term [01:36:49]. He urged people not to delay pursuing their dreams and to "start doing things today" rather than waiting for ideal conditions [01:32:18].

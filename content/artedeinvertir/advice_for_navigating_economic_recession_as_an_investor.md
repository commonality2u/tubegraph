Warren Buffett, widely regarded as the greatest investor of all time, has reportedly been preparing for a [[investment strategies during a financial crisis | financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. For the first time in a long period, Buffett has issued an important warning message to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. This marks only the third time he has issued such a significant warning, with previous instances preceding substantial setbacks in both the stock market and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:35">[00:00:35]</a>.

Buffett is taking drastic measures, rapidly selling stocks to build up a significant cash cushion to help weather upcoming economic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. His goal is to protect savings and investments and even potentially benefit in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:09">[01:03:09]</a>. Known as the Oracle of Omaha, Buffett is recognized for his ability to predict future economic and investment events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>. He acknowledges that crises and economic cycles are an inherent part of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>. His most successful investments have often come from being prudent just before a major economic crisis and having the courage to invest when pessimism is widespread <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:09">[01:36:09]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Warren Buffett's Warnings

Over 50 years, Warren Buffett has only twice before taken similar measures of rapidly selling stocks and issuing a caution message to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:09">[02:21:09]</a>. On both prior occasions, the market experienced declines of over 40%, and the economy entered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:09">[02:29:09]</a>.

### The First Warning (Early Career)
At the beginning of his career as an investment fund manager, after 13 successful years, Buffett declared that the economy faced significant challenges and stock market valuations were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:09">[02:53:09]</a>. Despite widespread belief that the market would continue to rise and a recession was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:09">[03:02:09]</a>, Buffett accumulated cash, eventually returning all money to his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:09">[03:13:09]</a>. Shortly thereafter, the stock market fell by 20%, accumulating nearly 50% declines over four years, and the economy entered a major recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:26:09">[03:26:09]</a>.

### The Second Warning (1999)
In 1999, 30 years after his first warning, Buffett took similar actions, cautioning about "enormous euphoria" in the stock market, unsustainable valuations, and an economic environment with significant challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:09">[03:42:09]</a>. Within six months of his warning, the dot-com bubble burst, leading to major stock markets plummeting by over 45%, with the Nasdaq technology index falling more than 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:09">[04:05:09]</a>. The US and European economies entered a recession 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:09">[04:10:09]</a>.

## Current Outlook and Reasons for Caution

Warren Buffett's current negative short- and medium-term outlook is based on several factors, as detailed in his statements and actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:09">[00:52:09]</a>.

### Accumulation of Cash
Berkshire Hathaway, Buffett's holding company, currently holds over $300 billion in liquidity, making it the most liquid and cash-rich company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:09">[05:07:09]</a>. This significant cash position is unusual for Buffett, as historically, his largest investments have been in stocks, which have provided his highest returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:44:09">[08:44:09]</a>. He earns 5% annually on this liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:09">[08:27:09]</a>.

### Sectors Being Sold or Avoided
Buffett has focused on reducing exposure to the financial and banking sectors, notably selling shares in long-held companies like Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:35:09">[05:35:09]</a>. These sectors are highly sensitive to potential [[investment strategies during economic recessions | economic recessions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:09">[05:50:09]</a>. Other sectors most affected by a potential crisis include real estate, technology (with the exception of some profitable positions like Apple, which he has significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:09">[06:14:09]</a>), and industrial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:09">[06:02:09]</a>. Buffett has sold off his real estate companies and no longer holds industrial sector companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:23:09">[06:23:09]</a>.

Conversely, the energy sector is considered one of the least affected during a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:09">[06:40:09]</a>. Buffett has recently expanded his positions in energy companies like Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:09">[06:53:09]</a>.

### Expert Consensus
Jamie Dimon, CEO of JP Morgan and a personal friend of Warren Buffett, shares a similar vision for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:09">[07:09:09]</a>. Dimon stated on Fox News that the "most likely outcome of the current crisis is an economic recession" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:16:09">[07:16:09]</a>.

### High Stock Market Valuations
In a recent conference, Buffett stated, "Given the current circumstances, I am comfortable increasing my cash and liquidity position. When I look at the alternative of investing in the stock market with everything that is happening in the world, it is not an attractive option for me." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:09">[07:48:09]</a>. He implicitly refers to global issues like tariff problems, conflicts between China and the United States, financial market speculation, and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:09">[08:06:09]</a>.

Buffett suggests that current valuations of most stocks are too high for the risks involved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:09">[08:23:09]</a>. A JP Morgan study indicates that when starting market valuations are expensive, future performance over the next 10 years tends to be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:09">[09:19:09]</a>. Currently, the expected return for the S&P 500 over the next decade is very low, possibly below 5% or even 0% per year, due to valuations ranging between 19 and 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:33:09">[09:33:09]</a>. The stock market typically trades at an average of 16 times earnings, but is currently at 20 times earnings, which Buffett believes is expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.

Buffett aims to use his liquidity to buy high-quality companies at attractive valuations in the future, as current prices for businesses with good long-term characteristics are "sky-high" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:09">[09:58:09]</a>. He would maintain his current decisions unless stock valuations significantly fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:09">[10:18:09]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Advice for Small Investors

When asked what he would do as a small investor with limited capital in the current high-valuation environment, Warren Buffett responded: "I would probably focus on smaller companies where there's a greater chance of finding a good investment. If I had less than a million dollars today, I would be fully invested" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:02:09">[11:02:09]</a>.

### Focus on Smaller, Lesser-Known Companies
Buffett clearly recommends investing in lesser-known companies, where the probability of finding an undervalued company is much higher, even in a generally expensive market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:09">[11:15:09]</a>. While indexing (investing in large, well-known companies) has yielded strong results historically and is a valid long-term strategy, the expected performance for the coming years is projected to be much lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:35:09">[11:35:09]</a>. Therefore, a complementary strategy could be to select individual investments to gain greater control and potential for long-term appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:46:09">[11:46:09]</a>.

Warren Buffett himself built his fortune by selecting his own investments in these lesser-known companies, which often have greater appreciation potential and are listed at more attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:16:09">[12:16:09]</a>.

### Key Investment Principles
Buffett's four keys to successful stock market investing include:
1.  **Buying good businesses with growing profits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:22:09">[12:22:09]</a>.
2.  **At attractive valuations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:25:09">[12:25:09]</a>.
3.  **With good management** that treats shareholders well, provides dividends, or buys back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:32:09">[12:32:09]</a>.

### Importance of Valuation
The easiest way to determine if a business is expensive or cheap is to compare its profits with its listed market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:39:09">[12:39:09]</a>. Buffett is highly disciplined in his investment valuation, which significantly reduces investment risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:09">[12:51:09]</a>. Historically, for 80% of his wealth-generating investments, he has rarely paid more than 15 times earnings when initiating a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:35:09">[00:13:35]</a>. If he cannot find such investments, he simply waits with liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:09">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Current Opportunities in Small-Caps
While Buffett's vast wealth limits his investment universe to only about 50 companies out of over 40,000 listed worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:09">[14:02:09]</a>, for a private investor, opportunities are abundant even in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:09">[14:08:09]</a>. Smaller, lesser-known companies often have greater growth potential at more attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:09">[14:15:09]</a>. Currently, small-cap valuations are notably undervalued, trading at just 12 times earnings, representing almost a 40% discount compared to larger indices like the S&P 500, Nasdaq, or Eurostock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:50:09">[14:50:09]</a>.

## Long-Term Perspective

Warren Buffett consistently emphasizes that [[investment strategies for economic crises | economic crises]] are inevitable but should be viewed as opportunities to make good investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:49:09">[15:49:09]</a>. Maintaining a long-term vision transforms these crises into opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:53:09">[15:53:09]</a>.

Investing in times of uncertainty can be quite educational, as it helps individuals understand how to keep calm and identify opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Significant returns are often made during bear markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For instance, people who invested in March, April, or May 2020 saw very high yields later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

## The Art of Investing Courses

Registrations are currently open for the 2022 edition of the "Art of Investing" courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. This program, which lasts 12 months, aims to teach individuals how to invest, guiding them "by the hand" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. The course has a lot of experience and is structured to provide value to students <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>. Past students have found it contributed significant value to their [[investment_education_and_strategies | investment journey]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.

The program aims to teach all the [[tools_and_knowledge_required_for_investing | tools]] necessary to become a successful investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. It's a complete formation with nearly 100 hours of training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:00">[03:27:00]</a>, expanded from what was previously an investment club into continuous training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>. The course is particularly valuable during market downturns, as it helps identify bargains and cheap shares that can generate positive future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:19:00">[10:19:00]</a>.

### Instructor's Background and Philosophy
The instructor, who started as a hobby investor from a humble family without money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>, began generating returns after acquiring knowledge, eventually living off investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a>. This knowledge was then applied to co-found the Triball project, managing funds for others, leading to significant growth from 3 million to almost 300 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.

The instructor believes in teaching from real-world experience, as they have gone through the same phases and problems students might face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:00">[03:40:00]</a>. The goal is to help students avoid mistakes that cost money, as the instructor had to learn a lot through trial and error due to a lack of affordable online courses previously <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. The course is created from the perspective of what the instructor would have liked to receive, saving participants from extensive trial and error and speeding up the learning process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.

Teaching has also helped the instructor improve their own investment results, with the last three years being the best in their history, coinciding with more intensive teaching efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:43:00">[04:43:00]</a>.

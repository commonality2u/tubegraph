The coming "new world economic order" is anticipated to be one of the most significant economic and social reforms in recent decades, with serious implications for both the stock market and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This shift has been [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | warned]] about by famous investor [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | Ray Dalio]] suggests that this new scenario could lead to a major crisis in the U.S. and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## About Ray Dalio

[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] is a prominent figure in the investment world, managing 100 billion dollars through his company, Bridgewater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. He is often described as the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the high reliability of his [[ray_dalios_market_predictions | predictions]] concerning the future of the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Dalio]] is also a renowned author and speaker, having participated in significant events like the World Economic Forum in Davos <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

## The Great Cycle and the Current Order's Origin

[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] posits that there is a "great cycle" that governs world economic orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. The current world order began in 1945 after World War II, establishing how the world would be divided and creating the U.S. dollar as the world reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This established a dominant power that led to a period of peace and prosperity, which is now on the verge of changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Dalio]] also warns that recent political extremism in the U.S. will accelerate this shift towards the new world economic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

## The U.S. Decline Phase

Through historical study, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] has observed that every dominant economy experiences two distinct phases: economic rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. Each phase is characterized by specific economic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. He indicates that the U.S. is currently entering this decline phase, marked primarily by:
*   **High Levels of Debt:** Significant indebtedness within the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>.
*   **Alarming Money Printing:** Money is being printed in unprecedented quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>.
*   **Economic and Social Inequality:** These factors contribute to growing disparities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

This decline could lead to a terrible [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_recession | economic recession]] in the U.S. and potentially affect the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>, impacting all types of investments, including real estate, stock market, commodities, and currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>.

In contrast, China is currently in its upward phase, characterized by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Consequences of Money Printing

Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve has printed record amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Its balance sheet grew from one trillion dollars to over seven trillion dollars, far exceeding the economy's general growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This "new economic experiment" is already causing consequences in the real economy, with inflation levels not seen in decades and significant increases in the price of raw materials, products, goods, and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

The concept of "helicopter money" — printing large amounts of new bills and distributing them to the public to stimulate consumption after an economic recession — was implemented by the U.S. government in 2020 through $1,200 checks to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. However, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] argues that if printing money were the solution to economic problems, countries like Zimbabwe would be the wealthiest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:24">[00:04:24]</a>. Historically, this approach has led to ruin for countries that have tried it, such as Germany, Argentina, Venezuela, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>.

### Economic Inequality

[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] highlights an extreme level of economic inequality in the U.S., leading to high discontent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. For instance, three individuals, including Jeff Bezos, hold more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. The richest 1% of the American economy has consistently prospered over the last 40 years, accumulating increasing wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

Historically, this social inequality leads to three major economic problems that impact savings and investments:
1.  **Increased Taxes:** Taxes are expected to rise in the U.S. and globally, as seen in Joe Biden's proposals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. This negatively affects the stock market by decreasing company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions:** [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] predicts worsening economic conditions, with the Federal Reserve already indicating future interest rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. This would particularly harm highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>.
3.  **Increased Regulations and Wealth Redistribution:** New regulations and measures aimed at redistributing wealth would negatively affect most types of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

## Investment Strategy for the New Order

In this economic environment, the worst strategy is to sell everything and hold liquidity, as the value of money will decrease due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Instead, it is crucial to remain invested in the "correct" assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. [[changes_in_ray_dalios_investment_approach | Ray Dalio]]'s investment philosophy aims to perform well in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### General Approach
[[changes_in_ray_dalios_investment_approach | Ray Dalio]] recommends having at least 40% of an investment portfolio in stocks, as they tend to perform well in this new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.

### Specific Investment Recommendations

Based on a Bank of America study covering 50 years of the stock market, specific sectors are predicted to perform best in an environment of rising inflation:

*   **Energy Sector:** This is projected to be the best-performing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
    *   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ):** A recommended stock, trading under the ticker CNQ at $32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It is one of Canada's largest oil and energy producers, producing over one million barrels of oil daily from high-quality lands with low extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Despite sideways performance in recent years, it offers an attractive valuation (4 times EBITDA, compared to a historical average of 6 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The company has an excellent track record of increasing dividends for 20 years, even through the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. If [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]]'s scenario materializes, its value could rise significantly, potentially above $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

*   **Raw Materials Sector:** Follows the energy sector in projected performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.

*   **Gold:** [[ray_dalios_investment_strategy on chinese stocks | Ray Dalio]] asserts that gold will always perform well if this new world order materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>. He recommends allocating at least 10% of a portfolio to gold investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>. The printing of money consistently decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth to financial assets, historically increasing the price of gold and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. Since March 2020, gold has risen from $1,500 to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
    *   **Gold ETFs:** The easiest way to invest in gold is through an ETF that tracks its performance. The largest global gold ETF is GLD (listed at $169 per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. A European alternative is iShares GN (listed at 30 euros per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.
    *   **Gold Mining Companies:** Investing in gold mining companies is more complex due to operational risks (floods, landslides, strikes) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. However, if they perform well and gold prices rise, these investments can appreciate significantly more than the price of gold itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. To reduce individual company risk, one can invest in ETFs representing a group of gold mining companies, such as the largest U.S. ETF, GDX (listed at $34 per share) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

*   **Personal Defense Products:** In a scenario of potential social unrest due to economic inequality and government bankruptcy, stocks of companies manufacturing personal defense products could perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.
    *   **Axon Enterprise (AXON):** Formerly called Taser, listed under the ticker AXON at $75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. Since 2008, as social inequality increased, its shares have risen from $6 to over $75 due to high demand for its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>. It trades at an attractive valuation (11 times this year's earnings, compared to a historical average of 16 times), indicating a potential realization of over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:29">[00:12:29]</a>. If [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]]'s scenario materializes, its potential could be significantly higher, several times its current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

## The Biggest Risk

[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] revealed that the biggest risk and his primary concern is what he calls the "advanced indicator of wars and revolutions" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>. After studying over 50 conflicts and revolutions, he observes that this indicator is the bankruptcy of governments after economic shocks, especially when accompanied by large economic inequalities and class differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. He warns that while this risk is not immediate, if the economy continues its current trajectory, an inflection point could be reached with severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

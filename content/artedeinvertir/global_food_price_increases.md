Global food prices are currently at a 10-year high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, with the global food price index returning to levels seen in 2011 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. This trend is considered dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Historical Context and Impact
Historically, rising food prices have generated tensions and internal conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:10">[00:11:10]</a>.
*   In 2011 and 2008, skyrocketing food prices led to internal rebellions, as desperate people with nothing to eat took to the streets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.
*   This phenomenon was evident during the "Arab Spring," where revolts occurred throughout Saudi Arabia, Yemen, Egypt, and Libya, eventually leading to armed conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
*   For developing countries, where food is one of the main expenses, significant price increases pose a very large problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:22">[00:12:22]</a>.

## Contribution to Wider Economic Risks
The increase in food prices contributes to overall [[us_and_global_inflation_trends | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>. Combined with [[effects_of_rising_energy_and_commodity_prices | rising energy prices]] and transport costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:53">[00:28:53]</a>, [[us_and_global_inflation_trends | inflation]] has reached its highest levels in 30 to 40 years in Europe and the United States, respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>. This rise in essential costs reduces the disposable income of consumers, potentially hindering overall consumption, which constitutes 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

## Risk Assessment
While significant, the risk associated with global food price increases is rated as 2 out of 10, indicating it does not tend to produce "very unpleasant situations" on its own <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:44">[00:12:44]</a>. However, if these high prices persist for many months, they can lead to situations of tension <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

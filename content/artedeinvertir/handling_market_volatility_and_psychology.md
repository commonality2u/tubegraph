The passing of Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's right-hand partner, marked the end of an era for many investors he influenced worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article compiles some of the techniques and wisdom that helped Munger achieve success in his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. His life story, especially his challenging early years, serves as an inspiration for many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## Charlie Munger's Path to Success

Charlie Munger's journey was far from easy. At 29, a divorce left him in poverty, without a home, and caring for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Tragically, at 31, his only son passed away from leukemia, a terrible disease at the time, and Munger lacked the money for treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Shortly after, he suffered a severe illness, losing sight in one eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Despite starting from an economically and emotionally ruined position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>, Munger pivoted from law to [[market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | real estate]] and later [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | stock market investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

He founded partnerships, akin to investment funds of the time, achieving a 19% annualized return over 13 years, compared to the Dow Jones' 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. After experiencing significant losses during the 1974-75 crisis and facing client pressure, he closed his fund and decided to invest only his own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. His main investments included Berkshire Hathaway and other stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. By age 69, Munger became one of the 400 richest people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a> and served as Vice President of Berkshire Hathaway, partner, and best friend to Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

## Key Investment and Life Advice from Charlie Munger

### 1. Don't Postpone Your Dreams and Act Decisively

In one of his last interviews, Munger emphasized that some things in life cannot be postponed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. He regretted not pursuing a dream of catching a 100kg tuna because it required a strong physique and high energy, something unattainable at his age <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. This serves as a metaphor: don't wait for the ideal moment or perfect conditions to act <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>. In [[strategies_for_investing_in_volatile_markets | investing]], this means avoiding "paralysis by analysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a> and starting, even if conditions aren't perfect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. Warren Buffett himself was advised against launching his fund in 1957, a historic moment for investing, due to perceived unfavorable economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Munger encouraged people to just start doing things, as you can always redirect later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

### 2. Embrace Low Expectations for Greater Fulfillment

Munger, despite his immense success, stated that he and Warren Buffett never imagined having $100 million when they started, let alone becoming billionaires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. They simply found the task of investing attractive and practiced it intensely for many years, which was key to their success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

He considered having low expectations as his best advice for both investments and life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. Generating gigantic, unrealistic goals can lead to frustration and negative feelings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:05">[00:22:05]</a>. Instead, Munger suggested having enthusiasm, being grateful, covering basic needs, learning daily, and letting life and investments surprise you <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

For [[understanding_stock_market_psychology | investing]], low expectations help mitigate stress and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. The expectation of winning every year in the stock market is unrealistic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>; even Munger and Buffett haven't achieved it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. Unrealistic expectations lead to frustration and a "fight against the market," when the market is, in reality, an excellent mechanism for wealth generation when approached correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:03">[00:24:03]</a>.

### 3. Accept Market Volatility

A core tenet of Munger's philosophy is accepting [[stock_market_volatility_and_strategies | volatility]]. He famously stated that if you cannot react calmly to a 50% drop in your portfolio two or three times throughout your life, you should not be a stock investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. He acidly added that those who don't accept this "deserve to have mediocre results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The stock market does not move linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Some of today's best investments, like Amazon, collapsed 98% before becoming exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:20">[00:25:20]</a>, and Tesla has had multiple 50-70% drops before revaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

Constantly trying to minimize losses and avoid [[market_volatility_and_how_to_navigate_it | volatility]] leads to mediocre results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. If you have made a good investment in a fundamentally sound company where nothing has changed, a drop can be a buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. Historically, market dips, especially of 20% or more, have been followed by significant returns in the subsequent 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:37">[00:26:37]</a>. Despite short-term news and predictions of recession or inflation, the world is increasingly prosperous, with more technology and advances, and fewer conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. This global prosperity, with more people joining the middle class and increasing consumption, is best accessed through companies listed on the stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

Munger emphasized that periods of market fall are much shorter (around 14 months) compared to bull markets (around 70 months), which offer significantly higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:52">[02:59:52]</a>. Therefore, investors must endure periods of 30-50% portfolio or individual stock drops to enjoy future gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:18">[02:29:18]</a>.

### 4. Investing Requires Continuous Learning, Not Shortcuts

Munger was direct: "This investment thing is not supposed to be easy, and whoever sees it as easy is stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. He noted that all successful people he met read a lot and possessed vast knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. There are no shortcuts in the stock market; a simplistic approach will likely lead to losses or below-average results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Investors should enjoy the process of learning about how companies work and why some prosper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:07">[00:31:07]</a>.

He also believed that the best help you can give another human being is knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. True satisfaction comes from self-realization, from achieving success through one's own work and gained knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### 5. Control Envy and Avoid Fashions

Munger stated that the world is not moved by greed but by envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Envy can lead to unpleasant feelings and undesired investment results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. While feeling envy might be normal, it should be transformed into motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>.

Envy fuels market bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. People see neighbors getting rich from trendy, overvalued stocks and, out of envy, sell their sound investments to chase fads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:26">[00:34:26]</a>. This leads to short-termism; the average holding period for a stock is now just 4 months, compared to 8 years in the past, largely due to the constant flow of news and social media fueling envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Decisions made out of envy are destined to fail and won't bring happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:20">[00:35:20]</a>.

Munger's approach to wealth is long-term, disciplined saving, reinvesting, and concentrated investing in a few well-understood businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:49">[00:36:49]</a>. Consistently investing in out-of-fashion assets tends to yield much better results because their valuation is often low, offering greater potential for growth as the market eventually recognizes their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:00">[00:40:00]</a>. Categories that were once "terrible to invest in" like REITs in 2008 later became the best performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:59">[00:41:59]</a>. Similarly, commodities, after years of underperformance (2014-2018), became top categories in 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:54">[00:42:54]</a>.

## Munger's Recommended Stocks and Their Lessons

Munger frequently shared insights on specific companies, often highlighting their fundamental characteristics rather than just their current price.

### Costco
Costco was one of Munger's long-term holdings, invested in for over 25 years since the late 90s, turning $10 into $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:43">[01:13:43]</a>. He considered it a "cannon" in the stock market, providing annual returns above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:13">[01:04:13]</a>. He would invest in Costco for the very long term due to its predictability, even if it's not a "get rich quick" stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>. Costco operates on a philosophy of consistently low prices and growing through economies of scale by selling large quantities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:03">[01:06:03]</a>.

### Coca-Cola
Munger, like Buffett, was a big fan of Coca-Cola, often describing it as the "perfect business" or a prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:29">[00:49:29]</a>. Buffett first invested in the mid-80s when it was just over $60 a share, and it grew from around $1 to almost $40 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. Coca-Cola's success comes from its low investment requirements, leading to high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. It sells an essentially unchanged product for over 100 years, requiring minimal research and development compared to industries like automotive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. This avoids ruthless competition and allows for high returns on invested capital, which can be reinvested for growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:28">[00:51:28]</a>. Coca-Cola has also intelligently diversified into other beverage categories to maintain growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>. Its ability to raise prices during inflation also makes it an attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:44">[00:48:44]</a>.

### Daily Journal (and its holdings)
The Daily Journal, originally a newspaper company, wisely reinvested its cash flow into stocks, serving as Munger's personal, ultra-concentrated public portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. It typically held only three stocks: Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:52">[00:57:52]</a> (though he later called Alibaba a mistake <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:59">[00:57:59]</a>). The vast majority (80%) of the portfolio was in the two banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:10">[00:58:10]</a>. Munger favored these banks because they benefited from rising interest rates and were in an out-of-fashion sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>, trading at much lower valuations (9-10 times earnings) compared to the S&P 500 (18 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>.

### Floor & Decor: The "New Costco"
Munger identified Floor & Decor as having much in common with Costco but being at an earlier stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. With a capitalization of $9 billion, it's 20 times smaller than Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Floor & Decor is a retailer specializing in floors and decoration materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:54">[01:06:54]</a>. Its competitive advantage lies in directly contacting manufacturers, handling import, distribution, and retail, bypassing intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:33">[01:07:33]</a>. This allows for consistently low prices. The company uses massive industrial warehouses (8,000 m²) to display materials, enhancing the customer experience and driving sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:02">[01:08:02]</a>. This model has thrived despite the internet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:28">[01:09:28]</a>, especially catering to professional clients who value advice and immediate merchandise availability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:56">[01:09:56]</a>.

Floor & Decor has shown spectacular growth, opening new stores at an 18% annual rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:30">[01:10:30]</a>, with existing stores also growing sales by 4-5% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:37">[01:10:37]</a>. Its profits have grown at a "beastly" 37% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:48">[01:10:48]</a>. The company has a solid plan to expand to 500 stores (triple its current number) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>, with new stores proving highly profitable (payback in 2.5-3.5 years, yielding ~25% return) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>. With only a 10% market share in the US market, estimated at $50 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>, it has significant growth potential. Despite a recent correction due to rising interest rates, Munger noted its high valuation is offset by its growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:38">[01:14:38]</a>.

These insights from Charlie Munger underscore the importance of psychological fortitude, long-term perspective, continuous learning, and avoiding emotional pitfalls like envy when navigating the complexities of [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | market volatility]] and making [[investment_strategies_during_market_volatility | investment decisions]].

This guide outlines a step-by-step approach to begin [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investing]] from nothing, even if you've lost all your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The focus is on making your savings profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## The Primacy of Knowledge

Many believe that a lot of capital is essential to start [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. However, [[tools_and_knowledge_required_for_investing | knowledge]] is more valuable than capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. With [[tools_and_knowledge_required_for_investing | knowledge]], a small amount of [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | money]] can grow significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. Conversely, a large sum of [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | money]] with little [[tools_and_knowledge_required_for_investing | knowledge]] is likely to diminish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Studies show that 70% of lottery winners are poorer after five years due to a lack of [[tools_and_knowledge_required_for_investing | knowledge]] and financial culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.

Instead of worrying about insufficient capital, focus on acquiring the necessary [[tools_and_knowledge_required_for_investing | knowledge]] to grow your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Generating Initial Capital (Savings)

The fastest way to generate [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | income]] again is to find a job and be methodical with your savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Pay Yourself First
This simple yet effective method involves paying yourself before paying others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. Automatically set aside a percentage of your salary (e.g., 10%) into an [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investment]] account immediately upon receiving it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. Then, adjust your monthly expenses to the remaining 90% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Most people save what's left after spending, which is usually very little <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. By implementing this method, your savings rate will increase drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Once accustomed, you can increase the percentage to 15% or 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Control Expenses
Think critically about every expense and whether it aligns with your financial goals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. For example, sharing a home instead of living alone can exponentially increase your savings rate, providing more capital for [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. Evaluate if purchases are truly necessary and if they bring you happiness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

## Investing in Knowledge (Education)

Once initial savings are generated, the next step is to [[investment_education_and_strategies | invest in knowledge]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

### Recommended Reading
The easiest and most economical way to learn the basics of [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] is through books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. A list of recommended books can be found in the video description, specifically a video detailing the 10 most helpful books in the world of [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. Consider buying second-hand books from sites like abebooks.com to optimize spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Avoid Analysis Paralysis
While reading is important, avoid "analysis paralysis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. Having a good foundation from about ten key books is sufficient to start performing your own analysis and making your first [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>.

### Practical Experience
[[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | Investing]] in the [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] is like flying a plane: simulators help, but actual flight hours are what count <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. The sooner you start [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investing]] with real [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | money]], the more market experience you gain, leading to better future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

## Starting to Invest with Real Money

When your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | capital]] is at risk, all your senses focus, forcing you to study and analyze more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>.

Begin [[how_to_start_investing_in the_stock_market | investing]] as soon as possible, but not with all your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. Start with 20%, 30%, or 40% of your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | money]] in more conservative [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] from large, well-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

## Choosing a Broker

The next step is to choose a broker for your first [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>.

### Recommended Broker
Interactive Brokers is a highly recommended option for [[tools_and_training_for_private_investors | private investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

### Key Factors for Broker Selection
1.  **Security**: Ensure the broker is domiciled in safe jurisdictions like the USA, United Kingdom, or Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>. Avoid brokers in less secure places like Cyprus or the Cayman Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>. Check the broker's website, usually at the bottom, for their regulated jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
2.  **Cash Investments**: Choose a broker that allows you to [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | invest]] in "cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. This means buying actual stocks, not derivatives (like CFDs, futures, forex, options) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Derivatives often involve leverage and are more complex, risking large losses for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
3.  **Asset Range**: Select a broker with a wide enough range of assets in which to [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | invest]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>. This increases the probability of finding excellent [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:52">[00:07:52]</a>.
4.  **Commissions**: Pay attention to commissions, especially when [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | investing with little money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. High commissions can significantly reduce your profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. As your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | capital]] grows, you might prioritize better service or higher security over lower commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Portfolio Management

When starting from scratch, your [[stock_market_investing_strategies | investment portfolio]] should be managed much more aggressively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The goal is to build wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. As your net worth grows, it becomes logical to be more conservative in your [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.

### Key Tips for Portfolio Management
1.  **Do Not Over-Diversify**: While 20-40 positions might be acceptable when starting and making mistakes, with experience, aim for 10-15 good [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>.
2.  **Focus on Small Companies**: Small companies often have higher growth potential and less competition from large [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investors]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. Large companies like Disney have limited growth potential as they are already global <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>. Small companies can multiply in value significantly in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

### Examples of Investments

#### Successful Investment Example: Constellation Software
Constellation Software (TSX: CS) was first learned about in 2014 when trading at $200 per share and has since grown more than sevenfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. It possesses desirable characteristics for a beginner's [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investment]]: it is a good, crisis-resistant, well-managed company that treats shareholders well, and had an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. While it's now a large company, it demonstrated the potential of small companies with high growth for a small [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investment portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>.

#### Failed Investment Example 1: More People Resources
More People Resources (ticker: LPO) went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. The main faults were:
*   **Cyclical Company**: Investing in cyclical companies (banks, insurance, auto, raw materials) is extremely complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. They often continue to fall and can go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.
*   **Debt**: The company had high debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>.
*   **Misaligned Management**: The management was not aligned with shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>.

#### Failed Investment Example 2: JG Wentworth
JG Wentworth also went bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investment]] mistake highlights the danger of [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investing]] in very novel business models or those you don't fully understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>. The company bought rights to future lawsuit compensations, advancing [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | money]] for a fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>. Government regulation, seeing it as harmful to individuals (like lottery winners) due to lack of financial literacy, ended the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>.

#### Current Promising Investment Example: Humanice
Humanice (PAR: ALAMS) represents an ideal [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investment]] for starting from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>.
*   Initially invested at just over €1 per share, it increased tenfold in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   It is a small, lesser-known company with significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:18">[00:17:18]</a>.
*   It met desirable characteristics: annual growth above 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:34">[00:17:34]</a>, large potential market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:38">[00:17:38]</a>, low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:43">[00:17:43]</a>, management aligned with shareholders (paying dividends and buying back shares) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>, and an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>.
*   These types of [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]], once identified, require courage to allocate a good portion of your portfolio, as one or two such [[how_to_start_investing_in_the_stock_market | investments]] can significantly boost your [[investing_in_the_stock_market_with_little_money | capital]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:59">[00:17:59]</a>.

[[Bill Gates investment strategies and decisions | Bill Gates]], one of the world's richest and most influential individuals, has recently begun selling shares from his stock market holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This shift, combined with his statements predicting a new crisis, offers insights into his [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment strategy]] and economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Acumen and Portfolio Overview

[[Bill Gates]] has amassed a fortune exceeding $120 billion, ranking him as the fourth richest person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While widely recognized for co-founding Microsoft, he is also an accomplished investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Currently, Microsoft shares constitute only 40% of his investments, with the remaining 60% diversified across a [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio of stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His demonstrated expertise in economics and the stock market makes his recent [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | portfolio changes]] and public statements noteworthy for reflecting on the economy's future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

[[Bill Gates]] has a history of accurate predictions; he foresaw a pandemic like the one recently experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, predicted the first company to develop a vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and has even given a projected end date for the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. He believes it is "certain that we will have a crisis similar to that of 2008 in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Recent Portfolio Shifts: A Defensive Posture

Analysis of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's most recent report, which serves as [[Bill Gates]]' investment vehicle, reveals a strategic divestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. He has sold 11 of the 18 shares in his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio]], purchasing only one new stock from a specific sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

In a February CNN interview, [[Bill Gates]] highlighted that the primary economic risk is the global lack of sufficient action to end the pandemic, noting that vaccines are primarily reaching rich countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This increases the risk of new variants spreading and returning to countries like the U.S., creating new infections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. This conservative outlook likely influences his [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | investment decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.

His recent [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | investment activity]] shows three key factors:
1.  **Selling Technology Stocks**: [[Bill Gates]] has divested from technology stocks such as Amazon, Google, and Apple, which were significant beneficiaries of recent market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
2.  **Exiting Uber**: He sold all shares in Uber due to its high valuation and fragility during an economic downturn, as it does not produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. These "Nasdaq tech stocks" have recently experienced sharp declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.
3.  **Divesting Alibaba**: All shares in Alibaba (ticker BABA) were sold at $225 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Despite being considered an excellent company, recent problems with Chinese regulators caused panic among investors and a sharp fall in shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

This shift suggests [[Bill Gates]] is positioning his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio]] for what is termed the "great rotation"—a movement of capital from disruptive or technological companies to more traditional and conservative ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. He has chosen defensive companies that are more resistant to a potential economic crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities [[Bill Gates]] is Optimistic About

Despite the broader sales, [[Bill Gates]] remains optimistic about certain investments, particularly those in resilient, traditional sectors.

### Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B)
*   **Weighting**: 43% of his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>
*   **Investment**: Over $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $250 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>

This investment reflects the strong friendship between [[Bill Gates]] and Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is positioned to withstand "literally any economic environment" while providing acceptable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>. Its profits and book value per share are estimated to grow at 7-12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. With a target valuation of over $400 in three to five years, it is considered a very conservative and safe investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Waste Management (WM)
*   **Weighting**: 10% of his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>
*   **Investment**: Over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $115 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:28">[00:08:28]</a>

Waste Management is the leading U.S. waste collection and recycling company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It is a traditional company, highly resilient to crises, and predictable in any economic environment, fitting [[Bill Gates]]' new [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | portfolio vision]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:36">[00:08:36]</a>. The recycling market is projected to grow above GDP, at 9% in the coming years, particularly in North America where the company operates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. With earnings per share growing at 10% per year, a future valuation close to $200 per share is estimated, offering interesting potential for a safe and conservative company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Walmart (WMT)
*   **Weighting**: 9% of his [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | portfolio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $135 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>

Walmart, the largest supermarket chain globally, is another example of a very conservative company that performs well in any economic environment, offering moderate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Canadian National Railway (CNI)
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $115 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>

Within the transportation sector, railroad companies are considered among the safest investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Their control over transportation lines makes them difficult for rivals to displace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. Rail remains a cost-competitive technology for transporting raw materials and industrial goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. With historical profit growth at 10% per year, its future valuation could reach $200 per share, presenting an interesting realization with reduced risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>.

### Other "Blue Chip" Holdings
[[Bill Gates]] also maintains holdings in high-quality "blue-chip" companies such as FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. These are large-cap companies known for providing adequate and predictable returns to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

### Schrödinger (SDR)
*   **Investment**: Over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>
*   **Current Price**: Approximately $71 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>

[[Bill Gates new investment in the company Schrdinger | Schrödinger]] is the only stock [[Bill Gates]] has recently bought <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>. This highly innovative company uses a new technological platform to help pharmaceutical companies develop new drugs or vaccines more quickly and effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. It possesses high growth potential, considering the U.S. medical research and clinical trials market alone is valued at $47 billion annually, while Schrödinger currently bills only $150 million per year, despite growing at over 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>. While it currently trades at a demanding valuation (over 40 times sales) and does not produce benefits, [[Bill Gates]]' investment suggests a very long-term view, potentially expecting the company to capture a significant portion of this market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This aligns with [[analysis_of_bill_gates_favorite_stocks_in_biotechnology | Bill Gates' interest in biotechnology stocks]].

## Bill Gates' Economic Outlook

[[Bill Gates]] predicts that a return to economic normalcy will not happen until the end of 2022, contrary to the common belief of late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This more conservative view of the future economy, driven by global pandemic challenges, appears to be a main reason for the recent [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | changes in his investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.

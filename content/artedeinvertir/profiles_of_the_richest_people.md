Examining the list of the world's wealthiest individuals reveals three primary profiles: entrepreneurs, stock market investors, and real estate investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. Locally, many countries also feature a significant number of real estate investors among their richest citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Real Estate Investment

Real estate investment can be highly profitable when executed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Why Real Estate is Profitable

Like stocks, real estate constitutes "real assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. They are essential for society, similar to how companies or stocks produce demanded goods and services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. Property and mobility address the basic human need for a home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Due to this fundamental necessity, real assets like real estate are excellent long-term investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. They perform well during periods of high inflation and economic crises, retaining their value effectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

The real estate market is substantial; in Spain and Latin America, real estate investment accounts for an estimated 40% of household assets, compared to merely 20% for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Generating Returns in Real Estate

Real estate investment can generate significant returns.

#### Case Study 1: Simple Rental Investment

Consider an investor who buys a property for €200,000 ($200,000) with the intention of renting it out <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The historical average rental profitability is 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. This would generate an annual income of €10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

From this gross income, it's crucial to deduct at least 30% for expenses, which include:
*   Management expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>
*   Occupancy expenses (due to vacant periods, typically 10-20% of the time) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>
*   Maintenance costs (annual allocation to keep the property in good condition) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:18">[00:02:18]</a>

After deducting these expenses, the net annual income would be €7,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. This net income is typically tax-free in most countries as the state allows for investment depreciation to reduce tax payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

The rental profitability on the initial €200,000 investment is calculated as €7,000 / €200,000 x 100 = 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>.

Beyond rental income, properties also appreciate in value, similar to how shares pay dividends and appreciate in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. On average, real estate typically appreciates by 3% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. Assuming a reasonable purchase price, this appreciation adds another 3% to the return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>.

Therefore, the total annual return in this simple case would be 6.5% (3.5% rental yield + 3% appreciation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

#### Case Study 2: Sophisticated Investment with Leverage

A more sophisticated investor might utilize leverage by taking out a loan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. Banks readily finance 70-80% of real estate investments, considering them safe assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.

Using the same €200,000 property with €7,000 annual net return, this investor borrows 70% (€140,000) and invests only €60,000 of their own capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

A new expense is the annual interest paid to the bank. Assuming an annual interest rate of 2% (common in Europe, though higher elsewhere with corresponding higher rental income) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>, the investor would pay €2,800 (€140,000 * 2%) in interest each year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>.

The net income after interest would be €7,000 (rent) - €2,800 (interest) = €4,200 annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>.

The new rental profitability, based on the investor's €60,000 invested capital, is €4,200 / €60,000 x 100 = 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>. This effectively doubles the initial profitability from the unleveraged example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>. This effect of using debt is known as financial [[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | leverage]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

Regarding revaluation, if the €200,000 property appreciates by 3% annually, its value increases by €6,000 per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Since the investor only put in €60,000 of their own capital, the return on revaluation rises to 10% per year (€6,000 / €60,000 x 100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

Combining both components, the total annual return in this leveraged scenario would be 7% (rental yield) + 10% (revaluation) = 17% before taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Challenges and Specialized Knowledge

While appearing simple on paper, real estate investment involves multiple variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Similar to the stock market, which yields around 10% long-term but sees some investors achieve over 20%, real estate investment requires specialized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. This includes understanding how to value properties, identify high-potential assets, select good tenants, and negotiate with banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Intense application of this knowledge can lead to spectacular results, fueled by passion, dedication, and effort <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>.

### Ways to Invest in Real Estate

There are three fundamental ways to invest in real estate, each with its advantages and disadvantages:

#### 1. Direct Investment
This involves personally buying a property and managing all aspects related to its rental and subsequent sale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   Most profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.
    *   Provides the greatest control over the entire process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   Requires the largest initial capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
    *   Limited diversification possibilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.
    *   Most time-consuming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.
    *   Demands the most knowledge for correct execution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

#### 2. Real Estate Funds
Marketed by banks or independent companies, these funds invest in real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:18">[00:07:18]</a>.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   Requires little time commitment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.
    *   Can be started with a very low initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   Lack of transparency, making it difficult to know how investments are managed within the fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>.
    *   Usually requires a minimum permanence period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>.
    *   Least profitable of the three methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

#### 3. Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs/Socimis in Spain)
These are listed investment vehicles that function like publicly traded companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Investors can buy shares in these REITs, whose objective is to invest in real estate properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. They typically buy, rent, and then sell properties after a few years to invest in others at more attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.

REITs offer multiple tax advantages, often being exempt from corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>. By law, they are required to distribute 90% of their profits to shareholders as dividends, providing a steady income stream <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. They also offer potential for revaluation, as their share prices can appreciate long-term if the underlying investments are well-managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.
*   **Advantages**:
    *   Requires a small initial investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
    *   Highly liquid assets, allowing shares to be sold easily for liquidity or risk management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.
    *   High possibility of diversification, enabling investment in properties across different regions (e.g., US, Canada, Europe) regardless of the investor's location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.
*   **Disadvantages**:
    *   Profitability is typically lower than direct investment but higher than real estate funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.
    *   Shares in the stock market are volatile, which can make beginner investors nervous and lead to ill-timed sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Understanding real estate investment reveals why it can be highly profitable in the long term when done correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

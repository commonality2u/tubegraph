Inflation has recently reached figures around 4-5%, drastically altering the investment landscape for the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Many major investors, including [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies during inflation | Warren Buffett]], Charlie Munger, and Ray Dalio, are warning that inflation could be longer than expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:00">[00:27:00]</a>. This environment raises questions not only about how to protect investments but also about identifying [[investment opportunities during inflation | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Impact of Inflation
Inflation significantly erodes the value of money over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>. For example, the purchasing power of the dollar has decreased by 80-90% over the last 40-50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. If an investment yields 5% but inflation is also 5%, it's equivalent to a 100% tax rate on profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:27">[00:5:27]</a>. This means money held in fixed-term deposits or liquidity loses value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:46">[00:5:46]</a>. Investing in productive assets, such as stocks, can help withstand inflation and potentially generate a higher return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:46">[00:5:46]</a>.

### Expert Warnings
*   **Warren Buffett:** Noted "quite significant inflation" at the annual investor conference, observing that prices were rising and people were accepting increased costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.
*   **Charlie Munger:** Warned that extensive money printing, quantitative easing, and zero interest rates are dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>. He even suggested such policies could lead to extreme scenarios like Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:5:59">[00:5:59]</a>.
*   **Ray Dalio:** Highlighted that central banks tightening economic conditions (raising interest rates or ending quantitative easing) could have a significant negative impact on markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:7:11">[00:7:11]</a>. He referenced 2018, when rapid interest rate hikes caused markets to drop by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:7:42">[00:7:42]</a>.

Central banks raising rates could cause market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. The market has seen a large influx of capital, leading to high valuations, and with interest rates at zero, future rate hikes in 2022 or 2023 make volatility likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:8:11">[00:8:11]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's "Toll Bridge" Strategy
[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_during_inflation | Warren Buffett's investment strategies during inflation]] emphasize businesses that act like a "toll bridge" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:9:54">[00:9:54]</a>. These are companies that have already made the bulk of their initial investment (with "old dollars") and do not need to constantly replace or significantly increase that capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. In an inflationary environment, such companies can raise prices in proportion to inflation, boosting income without a proportional increase in costs, leading to skyrocketing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

[!EXAMPLE] **Characteristics of a "Toll Bridge" Business:**
*   **Predictable and Recurring Demand:** Consumers must spend money on their products/services regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.
*   **Low Reinvestment Needs (Capex):** The majority of the investment was made in the past, and ongoing capital expenditures are low relative to cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.
*   **Ability to Raise Prices:** The nature of their business allows them to pass on increased costs or simply raise prices without losing significant demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Strong Brand/Reputation:** Existing brand equity reduces the need for continuous, large advertising or marketing investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

## Specific Investment Opportunities

The following examples illustrate businesses that align with Warren Buffett's "toll bridge" philosophy and can perform well during high inflation, or even in any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>:

### 1. Moody's (Debt Ratings)
Moody's provides debt ratings, a highly recurring business that thrives regardless of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. They have already built their brand and reputation, requiring minimal new investment to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. Their operating cash flow has seen a 150% increase from 2015-2021, while capital expenditures only rose by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Moody's can raise prices, and companies are willing to pay for their rating due to the significant interest savings it provides on bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.

### 2. Gold Royalty Companies (e.g., Franco Nevada)
While traditional gold mining companies can be volatile, gold royalty companies provide financing to miners in exchange for a percentage of future gold production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:33">[00:23:33]</a>. This insulates them from many mining risks and allows them to benefit from gold price increases without incurring the rising costs of mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. They've already made their investment in financing, and their revenues (in ounces of gold) increase with inflation, while costs remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>. Franco Nevada, for example, has outperformed NASDAQ, S&P 500, gold, and gold mining companies since 2007 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### 3. Fast Food Royalty Companies (e.g., EMT)
Companies like EMT own the rights to fast-food franchises, collecting a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:06">[00:28:06]</a>. Fast food performs well even during crises or high inflation, as it's often more affordable than cooking at home <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>. If restaurant menus raise prices due to inflation, EMT's revenue increases automatically without a proportional rise in their own central office costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:36">[00:28:36]</a>. EMT can support 50% more sales with the same central staff, leading to skyrocketing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.

### 4. Residential REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
Real estate investment companies have already invested in buildings ("old dollars") and don't need to rebuild from scratch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:01">[00:33:01]</a>. Residential REITs, particularly those with high occupancy and contracts linked to inflation (CPI), can increase rents to match or exceed inflation, boosting income without increasing their investment level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. Their properties also appreciate with inflation, while fixed-rate debt remains the same, further enhancing returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>. Some REITs are strategically positioned in states with appreciating home values and low tax rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>.

### 5. Financial Companies (e.g., New York Auto Finance)
Financial companies, including banks, tend to do well during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:51">[00:52:51]</a>. Their "investment" is giving loans, which were made with "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>. As interest rates rise with inflation, their income from new loans increases, and client solvency may even improve due to rising cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>. New York Auto Finance, for example, is a financial company that gives loans for cars and is expected to grow at double-digit rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:11">[00:53:11]</a>.

### Other Mentions
*   **Stone Company (Payment Solutions, Brazil):** A growing business in Brazil's payment solutions market, offering lower commissions than traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:34">[01:01:34]</a>. However, it listed at a high valuation and experienced a significant drop, highlighting the risk of overvalued stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:30">[01:02:30]</a>.
*   **Keystone Law (Law Firm, UK):** A law firm business with predictable growth, often through acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>. They require little capital to grow as the main investment is in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>.
*   **Lee Partners (Tax Filing/Accounting, Australia):** Similar to Keystone, this company provides essential, recurring accounting and tax services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>. It grows by recruiting advisors and sharing profits, exhibiting high growth rates and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Hamilton Son (Fertility Technologies):** Operates in the growing fertility technology market, buying smaller companies to integrate them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:48">[00:54:48]</a>. The market is projected to grow by 10% annually, and many services are recurring (software, consumables) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:27">[00:57:27]</a>.
*   **Boxlight Corporation (Interactive Educational Services):** Develops interactive services and equipment for classrooms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>. While it has seen spectacular revenue growth, its stock performance has been poor due to likely overvaluation at earlier stages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:21">[01:26:21]</a>.
*   **Lemonade (Insurance):** The speaker expresses skepticism about Lemonade, finding it difficult to see a competitive advantage in the insurance sector beyond simply giving away insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a>. It's considered overvalued, trading at four times its book value while unprofitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:31">[01:20:31]</a>.

## Contrasting Strategies: Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)
Inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) pay a fixed interest rate and increase based on US inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. However, they have historically yielded very poor returns (e.g., 1-2% annually over 15 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:00">[01:42:00]</a>. For private investors seeking asset growth, TIPS are generally not recommended due to their low profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

## General Investment Principles for Volatile Times
*   **Be Sensitive to Valuation:** Avoid buying assets at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. Overvalued stocks can fall significantly even if they are fundamentally good businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.
*   **Invest in Good Businesses:** Focus on companies with strong fundamentals and a clear competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a>.
*   **Consider Inflation's Impact:** Think about how inflation will affect a business model, particularly its ability to raise prices and control costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:00">[00:46:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** The stock market involves volatility, and drops are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. Successful investing requires patience and a long-term view, avoiding emotional selling during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning and Training:** The stock market is not "easy money" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>. It requires work, effort, and continuous learning to analyze companies, monitor performance, and adapt to new information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:33">[01:08:33]</a>.# Investment Strategies During High Inflation

## General Investment Principles for Volatile Times
To achieve success with [[strategies to protect investments during inflation | strategies to protect investments during inflation]] and in times of [[investment strategies during economic volatility | economic volatility]] or [[investment strategies during economic uncertainties | economic uncertainties]], consider the following principles:
*   **Be Sensitive to Valuation:** Avoid buying assets at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:41">[00:38:41]</a>. Overvalued stocks can fall significantly even if they are fundamentally good businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:31">[01:06:31]</a>.

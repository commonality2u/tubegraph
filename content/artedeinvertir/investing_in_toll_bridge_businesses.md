"Toll bridge businesses" is a metaphor coined by Warren Buffett for companies that make excellent [[Investment opportunities and strategies|investments]] during inflationary periods. These businesses are characterized by having already made the bulk of their capital [[Canadian National Railway and transportation investment|investment]] using "old dollars" (i.e., in the past), meaning they don't need significant new capital expenditures to maintain or grow their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>. This allows them to raise prices in line with or above inflation, leading to disproportionate increases in income and profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:46">[01:04:46]</a>. They also tend to be [[Predictable and stable business investments|predictable businesses]] where consumers consistently spend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:09">[01:11:09]</a>.

Investing in such businesses is a strategy recommended by major investors like Warren Buffett, Charlie Munger, and [[Investment opportunities recommended by Ray Dalio|Ray Dalio]] to not only protect against inflation, but also to find significant [[Investment opportunities and strategies|investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Inflation can erode the value of money in fixed-term deposits or liquidity, acting like an "additional tax" on investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of Toll Bridge Businesses

*   **Low Reinvestment Needs:** The primary investment has already been made, requiring minimal ongoing capital expenditure (capex) to maintain or grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:07">[01:07:07]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power:** Ability to increase prices in response to inflation without losing customers due to continuous or essential demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:51">[01:10:51]</a>.
*   **Predictable Demand:** Businesses offering products or services that consumers or other businesses *must* continue to purchase regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Ability to perform well in various economic environments, including periods of high or low inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:17">[01:11:17]</a>.

## Examples of Toll Bridge Businesses

### Moody's
Moody's, a credit rating agency, is cited as a classic example in Warren Buffett's portfolio that fits the "toll bridge" description <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.
*   **Recurring Business:** Bonds will always require credit ratings, making it a highly predictable and recurring business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:07">[01:31:07]</a>.
*   **Established Brand:** Moody's has already built its brand image and reputation, which required significant investment in the past, but now requires minimal ongoing capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power:** It can raise prices at or above the rate of inflation because its service provides significant value to companies issuing debt (saving them more in interest than the cost of the rating) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:25">[02:20:25]</a>.
*   **Low Capex:** Operating cash flow has risen significantly (from $1 billion in 2015 to an estimated $2.5 billion in 2022), while investment levels have remained relatively low (from $74 million in 2014 to $94 million in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:59">[01:59:59]</a>. This leads to skyrocketing free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>.
*   **Low Debt:** The company operates with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00">[01:41:00]</a>.
*   **Growth:** Moody's has achieved double-digit revenue growth (11% annually) and profit growth (15% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Franco Nevada
A gold royalty company, Franco Nevada, is another example of a toll bridge business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>.
*   **Financing Model:** It specializes in financing gold mining projects, receiving a percentage of future gold production from the mine as royalties, rather than direct cash payments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>. This means their income is tied to gold production, not just gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Old Dollars:** The company makes upfront investments in mines, but once financed, it does not have to invest more money to benefit from future production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. This protects it from rising investment costs due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income:** Mines produce a relatively predictable amount of gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
*   **Strong Performance:** Franco Nevada has outperformed NASDAQ, S&P 500, gold, and gold mining companies since 2007, with an average annual return of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>.

### MTY Food Group (MTY)
MTY Food Group operates on a royalty model for fast-food franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.
*   **Crisis-Resistant:** Fast food tends to perform well even during crises or high inflation because it's a competitive and often cheaper alternative to home cooking or more expensive restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>.
*   **Royalty Model:** MTY owns the rights to franchises and receives a percentage of restaurant sales, similar to a toll bridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation Benefit:** As restaurant menus raise prices due to inflation, MTY's revenue increases proportionally, while its own costs (primarily central office staff) increase much less, leading to skyrocketing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.
*   **Fixed Costs:** The business has many fixed costs, benefiting 100% from rising food and drink prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.
*   **Growth and Valuation:** It has grown at an average of 15% annually and is listed at a low valuation compared to its growth and stability (e.g., 11 times earnings), making it an attractive [[Investment opportunities and strategies|investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>.

### Residential REITs
Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) investing in residential properties also exhibit toll bridge characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:00">[03:03:00]</a>.
*   **Old Dollars:** They have already invested in or built properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   **Predictable Income:** People will always need places to live, ensuring consistent demand for apartments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>.
*   **Inflation-Linked Rents:** Rental contracts are often linked to inflation (CPI), allowing rents to rise proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:00">[03:37:00]</a>.
*   **No New Investment Required:** The company increases income without needing to build new buildings, and property values appreciate with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   **Fixed-Rate Debt Preference:** Companies with fixed-rate debt benefit greatly during inflation, as the real value of their debt decreases while asset values and income rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>.

### Keystone Law
A law firm, Keystone Law, demonstrates similar characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>.
*   **Predictable and Recurring:** Legal services are often recurrent and do not suffer significantly during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:08">[01:13:08]</a>.
*   **Low Capital Requirements:** Once established, law firms require little capital investment to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:10">[01:13:10]</a>.
*   **Growth:** The company has shown strong organic growth and also grows through acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>.

### Lee Partners
This company provides tax filing services and accounting consultancies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:02">[01:17:02]</a>.
*   **Mandatory Services:** All companies are legally required to do their accounting annually, making this a super predictable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:10">[01:17:10]</a>.
*   **Growth Model:** Lee Partners grows by acquiring or recruiting accounting and tax advisors, giving them a percentage of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:15">[01:17:15]</a>.
*   **Strong Performance:** It has no debt and has shown strong growth in revenue and operating profit, achieving growth rates of almost 20% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:26">[01:17:26]</a>.

### Other Considerations
Other types of businesses that can perform well in inflationary environments include financial companies, as they benefit from rising interest rates, and companies in the raw materials and gold mining sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

# Investment Strategies in Inflationary Environments

*   **Valuation Sensitivity:** Do not buy anything at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>.
*   **Good Businesses:** [[Importance of investing in exceptional businesses|Invest in good businesses]] with strong fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.
*   **Portfolio Concentration:** Private investors have an advantage in concentrating their portfolio in a smaller number of high-conviction companies (e.g., 8-15 companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:31">[01:07:31]</a>.
*   **Liquidity and Agility:** Private investors can enter and exit positions very quickly, allowing them to capitalize on temporary market opportunities or react to risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:07">[01:08:07]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning:** Understand that [[Investment opportunities and strategies|investing]] requires work, effort, and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>. It is not "easy money" and requires dedication to monitor investments and adapt to changing conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:39">[01:08:39]</a>.

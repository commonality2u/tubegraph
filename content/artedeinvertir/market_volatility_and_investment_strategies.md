The current market environment is characterized by significant [[market_volatility_and_how_to_navigate_it | volatility]] and economic uncertainty, as highlighted by investor Bill Ackman. He predicts a potential market collapse unless specific measures are taken, and he offers insights into how investors should position themselves in this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Current Economic Climate

Recent market activity shows a concerning trend:
*   **Market Falls** Significant market falls occurred due to expectations that inflation would moderate, but it has worsened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.
*   **Consumer Confidence** Consumer confidence is at historic lows, even lower than during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Consumption accounts for 70% of the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Mortgage Market** Applications for new mortgages in the U.S. are at a 22-year low, impacting the mobile market significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. The sale of homes has halted due to 30-year mortgage interest rates rising to 62%, a level not seen in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
*   **Inflation Concerns** People are increasingly nervous about inflation and rising gasoline prices, which negatively affects consumer confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. Even excluding car prices, inflation remains high at 66%, nearing 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.
*   **Unprecedented Situation** Historically, there has never been an economy slowing down with inflation close to 9% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, which forces the Federal Reserve (Fed) to combat inflation, potentially accelerating an economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.
*   **Inflation Expectations** Inflation expectations for the next three years have risen from a historical average of 2.5% to 37% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Expected inflation for 2023 is now 4.5% to 5.5%, up from 3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Perspective and Fed Recommendations

Bill Ackman, known for his accurate market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>, believes the Fed needs to be much more aggressive in its actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

### Recommendations to the Fed
During a select New York finance club meeting, which informs the Fed, Ackman advised:
*   Maintain a neutral interest rate much higher than the expected 2.75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.
*   Accelerate the contraction of the Fed's balance sheet (reducing money printed to solve the crisis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>.
*   Raise interest rates more aggressively, including multiple 0.5% increases, possibly even 0.75% or 1% at the next meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

### Contrarian View on Interest Rate Hikes
Contrary to the market's common belief that rising rates are negative, Ackman argues that decisive action by the Fed will restore confidence and lead to a strong market recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.
*   If the Fed does not act, the market will "do the job" by collapsing, leading to a recession in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.
*   [[Stock market volatility and strategies | Stocks]], as long-duration assets, are valued by discounted cash flows over many years, similar to long-term bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. Low interest rates typically favor these assets, including technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.
*   The initial drop in stock prices during rate hikes is due to the Fed acting in advance to keep inflation in a predictable range (2-3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
*   By raising rates decisively, the Fed can prevent inflation from becoming entrenched and structural, like in Argentina or Venezuela <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. This decisive action, even if it leads to a specific recession, will ensure long-term economic prosperity with low inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### Market Dynamics and Investor Sentiment
*   **Market Cleanup** The market has seen a "cleanup" as "hot money" or "weak hands" (small retail investors who entered during euphoria) have exited, leading to a healthier market for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:14">[00:24:14]</a>.
*   **Insider Purchases** Corporate insiders are buying shares, suggesting they believe future benefits will improve or valuations are positive. Historically, insiders buy because they expect prices to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:15">[00:25:15]</a>.
*   **NASDAQ 100 Correction** The NASDAQ 100 has fallen similarly to the 2000 bubble, suggesting a significant adjustment has already occurred <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>. Valuations have compressed from an average of 65 times earnings in 2000 to around 20 times earnings now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:46">[00:27:46]</a>.
*   **Investment Styles** Growth stocks have become cheaper than value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. None of the current investment themes are considered overvalued, with some already starting to be cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:51">[00:29:51]</a>. The S&P 500 has corrected around 18% from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:07">[00:30:07]</a>. Small and medium-sized companies (Russell 2000) have seen a 30% fall, presenting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:24">[00:30:24]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies during market volatility | Investment Strategies during Market Volatility]]

Bill Ackman provides two main pieces of advice for investors navigating the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>:

### 1. Invest in Predictable Businesses
Focus on businesses with predictable operations that can raise prices to combat inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>. These are generally businesses that do not suffer much during economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>.
*   **Examples:** Domino's Pizza, Burger King (via Restaurant Brands International), and Chipotle are examples of fast-food businesses that are not highly sensitive to the economy and can affordably withstand inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.
*   **Netflix Example:** Ackman sold his Netflix shares because, despite the business being simple to understand, he lost confidence in its future predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>.
*   **Linearity and Predictability:** Companies that show a "linear" growth in the stock market (meaning consistent, predictable increases) tend to be desirable, especially for novice investors who get nervous with volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:11">[00:16:11]</a>.
    *   A linearity coefficient approaching 1 suggests a nearly perfect straight line of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
    *   Examples of linear companies (from a Long Ten Equity Fund study):
        *   **U.S. Companies:** Mastercard, Progressive (low-cost insurer favored by Warren Buffett), SBA Communications (telecommunications towers insulated from crises), Microsoft, Dollar General, Thermo Fisher, United Health, S&P Global, Moody's, AutoZone, Old Dominion Freight Line <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
        *   **Canadian Companies:** Constellation Software (most linear company in the last five years), Waste Connections (urban waste recycling, very predictable), Colliers, Brookfield Renewable Partners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
        *   **French Companies:** Voltess Club, Argan (real estate for logistics centers), Robertet, ASML <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.

### 2. Invest in Businesses Unaffected by Rising Interest Rates
This primarily means avoiding companies with very high debt at variable rates, which pose a significant risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:41">[00:22:41]</a>. While long-term effects of rising rates might be positive, cyclical businesses could suffer in the short term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:58">[00:22:58]</a>.

## Examples of Predictable Businesses (and investment lessons)

### Copart (COPR)
*   **Business Model:** Auctions salvage vehicles from insurance companies to professional clients and individuals for parts or total cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:19">[00:33:19]</a>.
*   **Predictability/Moat:** Difficult to replicate facilities, permits, and established contacts with large insurance companies create a strong competitive advantage (scale) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:14">[00:34:14]</a>. Online auctions and international expansion contribute to structural growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:06">[00:35:06]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Operating profit only fell slightly (5.3%) in 2009 during the crisis and has rebounded consistently since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:37">[00:35:37]</a>.
*   **Growth:** Annual earnings per share (EPS) growth of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>. Sales growth is around 13% organically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:59">[00:35:59]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Currently trading at 24 times earnings, below its 5-year average of 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:18">[00:37:18]</a>.

### Descartes Group (DSG.TO)
*   **Business Model:** Software that simplifies international trade by managing customs procedures and bureaucracy, offering critical solutions to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:44">[00:40:44]</a>.
*   **Predictability/Moat:** World leader, offers critical services that save headaches and costs, possesses pricing power, and benefits from increasing global trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:24">[00:41:24]</a>. Growth comes from organic growth (10-12% annually) and strategic acquisitions of smaller companies in specific regions or niches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:51">[00:41:51]</a>.
*   **Resilience:** Grew at a double-digit rate during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:13">[00:44:13]</a>.
*   **Growth:** Estimated to grow at 10% annually until 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:29">[00:43:29]</a>, with an average growth of 15% (including acquisitions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:47">[00:43:47]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Trading below its 5-year average of 33 times earnings, currently around 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:33">[00:44:33]</a>.
*   **Investment Lesson:** Selling high-quality, predictable companies too early (e.g., taking profits after a 60-70% rise) can be a serious mistake, even if profitable in the short term, as it forfeits significant long-term gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:28">[00:38:28]</a>.

### Teleperformance (TEP.PA)
*   **Business Model:** Outsourcing of call centers and customer service, including digital services like WhatsApp and robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:33">[00:46:33]</a>.
*   **Predictability/Moat:** Companies outsource non-core services to save costs and reduce complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:37">[00:46:37]</a>. Teleperformance benefits from high credibility and reputation, which is crucial in regulated sectors like banking where errors can be costly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:30">[00:47:30]</a>. Scale provides a significant competitive advantage, allowing it to secure large contracts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:19">[00:48:19]</a>. Growth is complemented by acquiring smaller companies with niche market experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:36">[00:48:36]</a>.
*   **Growth:** The global market for outsourcing is growing at 3-4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. Teleperformance aims to reach 10 billion in organic sales and an additional 2 billion from acquisitions by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Current valuation has dropped to its 5-year average of 24 times earnings, which is above the market average but reflects its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:03">[00:52:03]</a>.

## General Investment Advice

*   **Don't Confuse Good Business with Good Investment:** An excellent asset with a spectacular future can still be a poor investment if purchased at a very high valuation, leading to significant losses and long recovery times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:07">[00:55:07]</a>. Conversely, a seemingly "bad" asset at a ridiculously low price can be an excellent investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:03">[00:56:03]</a>.
*   **Understand Your Investments:** Only 10% of crypto investors claim to fully understand how it works <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>. Understanding the business model and risks is crucial; otherwise, investors become "puppets of the market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">[00:56:49]</a>.
*   **Avoid Overreacting to Market Falls:** The worst thing to do is change your investment style based on short-term performance, as this often leads to a "double loss" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:26">[01:12:26]</a>.
*   **Be Prepared for Volatility:** Investors should be perfectly comfortable with the possibility of losing 40-50% of their investment without panicking or making rash decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:45">[01:28:45]</a>. Market corrections offer opportunities to increase positions, especially for those who can generate income from their work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:17">[01:29:17]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View:** Statistically, 50% market falls are very rare, happening every 30-40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:41">[01:29:41]</a>. Having a solid portfolio prepared for these moments is more important than predicting the exact depth of a fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:16">[01:30:16]</a>.

### Other Companies Mentioned in Discussion:
*   **Autodesk (ADSK):** Transitioning its business model from license sales to cloud-based subscriptions, which can lead to short-term revenue deceleration but accelerate future growth and margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:06">[01:03:06]</a>.
*   **Costco (COST):** A unique company with a predictable double-digit EPS growth, considered a "stock for life" by some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:26">[01:00:26]</a>. Valuation has compressed from 45 times earnings to its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.
*   **Pricesmart (PSMT):** A Latin American company that copied Costco's business model but with worse execution due to weaker, more cyclical regional economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:07">[01:01:07]</a>. Its profits have not grown significantly in recent years compared to Costco <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.
*   **Porsche (P911.DE):** A potential spin-off that could be highly profitable if all shares are distributed, as its value could exceed Volkswagen's entire market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:18">[01:08:18]</a>.
*   **Direct Line (DLG.L):** A UK-based insurer similar to Progressive, with a business model highly resistant to crises and a low valuation (11 times profits) and a 7% dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:57">[01:09:57]</a>.

*   **LVMH (MC.PA):** Luxury consumption giant that has integrated Tiffany well and continues to see growth, surprising given the current corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>. Share buybacks by management indicate confidence in future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:59">[01:13:59]</a>. Its customer base is broader than often perceived, including aspirational buyers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:13">[01:16:13]</a>.
*   **FirstService (FSV):** Manages private properties, including apartment buildings, and offers outsourced services. It has high customer retention and strong growth through organic means and acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:30">[01:20:30]</a>.
*   **Olaplex (OLPX):** A newer company with a patent-protected technology for hair restoration. It shows high margins (68% EBITDA) and strong sales growth, but its longevity and potential for future competition once patents expire are considerations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:55">[01:33:55]</a>.
*   **Euroapi (EAPI.PA):** A European spin-off specializing in active pharmaceutical ingredients, operating in a sector with good competitive sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:03">[01:40:03]</a>.

*   **SAB (SAB):** A niche market company with a good competitive position and predictable, albeit limited, growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:24">[01:54:24]</a>. It has pricing power due to its entrenched position in client processes, making it less affected by inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:52">[01:54:52]</a>.

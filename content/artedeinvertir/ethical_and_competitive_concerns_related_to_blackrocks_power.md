BlackRock is a prominent company often described as the "owner of the world" due to its extensive control over global assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores the ethical and competitive concerns arising from BlackRock's significant influence and power in the financial system and global economy.

## BlackRock's Tremendous Influence

[[blackrocks_influence_on_the_global_economy | BlackRock]] controls over $10 trillion in assets, making it the largest shareholder in major listed companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. To put its size in context, these assets represent more than 10% of the world economy, exceeding the economies of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. The company is led by Larry Fink, whose economic power is considered among the greatest globally, yet he remains largely unknown to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>.

### Client Base and Financial Sector Control
BlackRock's objective, like any private company, is to generate profits for its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>. Its clients primarily include banks, insurers, pension plans, and sovereign funds from wealthy nations, but also small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. BlackRock significantly controls the financial sector, holding majority positions in major global banks such as Wells Fargo, Banco Am√©rica, City Group, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This creates a paradoxical relationship where these banks, which are also BlackRock's main clients, continuously provide it with more funds, allowing BlackRock to increase its controlling stake over them and other key companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It is highly likely that personal savings invested through banks' plans or even held in deposits may end up in [[blackrocks_investment_strategies_and_influence_on_markets | BlackRock]] products, often channeled through its commercial brand, iShares ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>.

### Role in Crisis Management
[[impact_of_blackrock_on_financial_systems | BlackRock]]'s influence extends to critical junctures in the financial system. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve commissioned BlackRock to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Additionally, BlackRock is a major lender to emerging countries, further solidifying its global reach and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

## Ethical Concerns and Conflicts of Interest

BlackRock faces direct accusations of contributing to environmental damage, social inequality, and financial fraud due to its immense power and control over companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

### Auditing and Investing Paradox
A controversial aspect is BlackRock's Solutions division, which audits and controls the risks posed by major global banks to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This is curious because BlackRock is simultaneously a primary investor in these very banks and is tasked with assessing their internal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. The company claims these are entirely separate operations with "Chinese walls" for information control, but this raises questions about impartiality and transparency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

### Concentration of Power and Competition
The rise of passive investment through BlackRock's ETFs (like iShares) concentrates voting rights and control into very few companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This creates circular structures where funds provided by clients empower BlackRock to control key financial and economic entities, which in turn provide more funds, further increasing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

This accumulation of power leads to potential conflicts of interest regarding competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, while BlackRock may not be a top shareholder in McDonald's, it is among the main shareholders of its competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This pattern, where the same company controls major competitors within a sector, is observed in the automotive, airline, and financial sectors, raising questions about the freedom of competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

### Influence over Media and Corporate Behavior
[[blackrocks_control_over_listed_companies_and_banks | BlackRock]] also exerts significant power over the media, with estimations suggesting control over 95% of traditional and new generation media, including platforms like Facebook, through its major shareholdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This influence allows it to shape public opinion. In 2021, BlackRock leveraged its power to pressure companies like ExxonMobil to reduce CO2 emissions, demonstrating its ability to influence corporate policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Market Implications and Risks

The trend of passive investment, particularly through BlackRock's products, raises concerns about market stability and valuation. BlackRock's iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (IVV) is one of the most traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, with a daily volume exceeding $2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Market Valuation Concerns and Passive Investment Bubble
Large investors like Michael Burry, known for his accurate prediction of the 2008 financial crisis, have warned that passive investing and ETFs currently represent a "huge bubble" due to the inflated valuations of many companies, regardless of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

These ETFs operate by forcing automated buying systems to acquire more shares of a stock as it rises and gains relative weight in an index, further driving up its valuation and attracting more passive investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This creates a scenario where sustained high valuations depend on continuous capital inflows, likened to a "hot chairs game" where eventually there won't be enough chairs, leading to losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Individual Investment Responsibility
Given these complex dynamics, it is crucial for investors to take full responsibility for their investments. This includes understanding where money is invested, the commissions paid, and the associated risks and expected returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. The financial system can seem complex, highlighting the importance of continuous education <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While simplifying investments through ETFs might seem appealing, it potentially creates financial imbalances. The speaker believes that individual security selection will gain more importance in the future, as disparities in valuation will emerge between companies included in popular indices and those overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

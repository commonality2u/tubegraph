The dollar, currently considered the world's most important currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>, has begun its [[decline_of_the_us_dollar | decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This shift will affect the value of other currencies, savings, investments, the level of [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]], and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Prominent investors like [[Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmillers views on the dollar | Ray Dalio]] and [[Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmillers views on the dollar | Stanley Druckenmiller]] have warned that the dollar will lose value and have begun selling their dollar holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Current Status and US Privileges
The dollar's status as the world's reserve currency grants the United States significant privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>:
*   **Money Printing without High [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | Inflation]]** The US can print large amounts of new dollars without generating significant [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] because there is constant demand for the most important currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. Currency values are determined by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Historically, during [[challenges_of_economic_recession | economic problems]], the US has simply printed new dollars to solve issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>. For example, to solve the 2020 crisis, 23% of all dollars in circulation were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. While some [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] occurred, it was minor compared to countries like Argentina, which saw 60% annual [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] from an 80% increase in its central bank balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. In contrast, the US Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew over 120% in less than 1.5 years during 2020, yet [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] only reached around 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:28]</a>. This unique ability has allowed the US to prosper after crises, unlike many other nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Lower Interest Rates for Financing** The dollar's status enables the US and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This provides a competitive advantage for their economies to prosper, as investors are reluctant to lend to countries with weak currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This creates a "virtuous circle": a stronger currency attracts more loans, making it cheaper to borrow, further strengthening the currency, and allowing more money printing with fewer consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## Challenges to Dollar Dominance
An alliance led by China, involving the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, China, and South Africa), seeks to end the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This new power group was formed to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a> and holds 43% of the world's population, compared to the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>. More countries are joining BRICS to escape dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

Key aspects of [[Chinas strategy to challenge the US dollar | China's strategy]] include:
*   **De-dollarization Initiative:** BRICS nations openly state their intent to no longer be subject to the dollar's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. The newly elected President of Brazil, Lula da Silva, expressed that one of his objectives is to end dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. At the BRICS Summit in 2022, a roadmap was established to end the dollar's reign <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>.
*   **Currency Movement:** The Chinese renminbi (yuan) is gaining market share; since the conflict in Russia began, its international market share has doubled from 2% to 4%, approaching the Euro's share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The dollar index has plummeted more than 13% in less than 9 months following the BRICS roadmap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.
*   **Trade in Local Currencies:** The BRICS alliance proposes trading within its territory using their own currencies, excluding the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. This would boost the value and international demand for their currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.
*   **Military Superiority:** Historically, a world reserve currency is associated with military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. China recognizes this and is significantly increasing its military spending, estimated to surpass the US within five years, exceeding $500 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. This trend is expected to force the US to also increase defense spending to maintain its hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.
*   **Free Trade Zone:** China's second major strategy is to create a large, tax-free free trade area among all BRICS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Over 60% of the world's population plans to join this area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In contrast, past US attempts at similar trade agreements, like the TPP, have failed due to internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Economic Repercussions
This movement would constitute an "economic earthquake" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
[[The decline of the US economy and the rise of China | Ray Dalio]] notes that while China is in a phase of ascent, the United States is in a phase of [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | decline]], which will eventually lead to the dollar's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. If the dollar's value falls, it would cause an increase in [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. In such a scenario, holding liquidity or traditional bonds not protected against [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] is a poor idea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies to protect against dollar devaluation | Investment Strategies to Protect Against Dollar Devaluation]]

### Gold
[[Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmillers views on the dollar | Ray Dalio]] advises investors to protect themselves from the dollar's fall by investing in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. He considers gold the purest form of money that cannot be printed from thin air, offering protection against currency decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Gold has appreciated by an average of 9% annually over the last 20 years, even when measured against major currencies, and has shown low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>.

Ways to invest in gold include:
*   **Physical gold:** Involves security and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Gold mining companies:** Can face operational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
*   **Gold ETFs:** The method favored by [[Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmillers views on the dollar | Ray Dalio]], representing ownership of the precious metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>. Examples include GLD (ticker: GLD, price: $182) and EGRN (European alternative, price: €35) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities)
[[Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmillers views on the dollar | Stanley Druckenmiller]] suggests investing in TIPS, which are inflation-protected bonds that guarantee a return above [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Their price has recently fallen as markets assume [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] will not increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:27">[00:14:27]</a>.

Ways to invest in TIPS:
*   **Direct bond purchase:** Can be complex <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.
*   **ETFs investing in TIPS:** Easier way, such as Charles Schwab's TIP bond ETF (ticker: SCP, price: $54, annual yield 6.5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. A similar European ETF offered by Blackrock (ticker: ITPE, price: €5) offers a currency-hedged version <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

### Stock Market Investments
In periods of [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]], real estate and stock market investments have historically performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:12">[00:16:12]</a>.
*   **Foreign Exchange (Forex) Market:** One can sell one currency against another, e.g., the US dollar against the Chinese yuan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>.
*   **American Exporting Companies:** Look for US companies listed in dollars with significant export components to non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. When they translate foreign currency profits into dollars, their profits increase, leading to stock appreciation and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. For example, after Brexit, when the pound fell 20%, UK exporting companies like Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline saw their stocks rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>.
*   **Companies with Exposure to the Chinese Economy:** Invest in companies with a high degree of exports to China to benefit from its expected [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | economic boom]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Examples include casino companies like Wynn and Las Vegas Sands, and technology/semiconductor companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
*   **Luxury Sector Companies:** Many luxury companies are denominated in euros or dollars, and Chinese consumers are major buyers of these goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. An [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_the_rise_of_china | economic boom]] in China would increase their sales, translating into higher profits in euros or dollars, providing real coverage against a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Companies like Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Ferrari have historically prospered in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

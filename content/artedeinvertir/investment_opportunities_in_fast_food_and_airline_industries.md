## Investment Opportunities in Fast Food and Airline Industries

Extraordinary liquidity measures have been approved, which are anticipated to positively impact [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock markets]] in the medium and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This environment creates [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | investment opportunities]] in high-quality companies at prices not seen for years due to widespread market sell-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

### Learning from World-Class Investors
Studying successful investors and modeling their techniques is an effective way to learn to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

#### David Tepper
David Tepper, founder of Appaloosa Management, has one of the best track records in the last 30 years, generating an annual return of 25% for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:17">[01:30:17]</a>. He is known for being "one of the bravest investors on Wall Street," similar to Warren Buffett, buying stocks during periods of panic when other investors are hesitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:11">[01:47:11]</a>. His best returns followed these market panics, as he could invest at the most attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:37">[02:15:37]</a>.

In a recent interview, Tepper advised that investors should not buy just "any share," but rather "good companies" with a "solid competitive position" and no debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:48:07">[03:48:07]</a>. Weaker, indebted companies may not survive economic downturns, while stronger ones will increase their market share and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:19">[03:54:19]</a>. He was buying stocks in the healthcare sector and large technology companies like Amazon, Google, and Alibaba <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:10">[04:29:10]</a>.

#### Bill Ackman
Bill Ackman is another legendary Wall Street investor, accumulating a personal fortune exceeding $1.6 billion by generating annual returns of over 16% for his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:48">[05:17:48]</a>. He has a reputation for navigating bearish periods well; in 2008, his fund lost only 13% while the S&P 500 lost almost 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>. Bill Ackman stated he was "super bearish but now I'm bullish" and was aggressively buying shares of Hilton, Restaurant Brands, and Starbucks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:52">[06:14:52]</a>.

### Investment Opportunities in Airlines: Airbus
Airbus (ticker: A&R, listed in France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:07">[07:03:07]</a> is a classic example of a high-quality company currently at the "epicenter of the storm" due to its association with airlines, which are not currently popular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:46">[07:15:46]</a>.

*   **Market Position:** The commercial aviation business is an oligopoly dominated by Boeing and Airbus, a trend that has persisted for the last 50 years and is expected to continue for another 50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:04">[07:33:04]</a>. Attempts by competitors to enter this market have often resulted in bankruptcy or acquisition by Boeing and Airbus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:25">[07:46:25]</a>.
*   **Predictability:** Airbus is a highly predictable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:09">[08:17:09]</a>. Once the current problem subsides, air traffic is expected to grow again, leading to more plane orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:09">[08:03:09]</a>.
*   **Order Book:** Airbus has an order book of 8,000 aircraft, equivalent to 480 billion euros or seven years of income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00">[08:32:00]</a>. If an Airbus aircraft is ordered today, delivery can take up to eight years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:39:56">[08:39:56]</a>.
*   **Balance Sheet:** Airbus has a liquidity surplus of 12 billion dollars (equivalent to 20% of its market capitalization or over 14 euros per share) after discounting its debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:27">[09:39:27]</a>.

#### Valuation
*   **Current Price:** 68 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:43">[07:05:43]</a>.
*   **Earnings:** Last year, Airbus earned around six euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:25">[09:42:25]</a>.
*   **Adjusted Valuation:** Adjusting for excess liquidity, the valuation is a low 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:49:50">[09:49:50]</a>.
*   **Historical P/E:** Historically, high-quality, predictable growth companies like Airbus rarely trade below 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:30">[09:56:30]</a>.
*   **Target Valuation (Current Problem Over):** Valuing at a P/E of 20 times normalized earnings, the target valuation would be 120 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:17:48">[10:17:48]</a>.
*   **Target Valuation (5 Years):** In five years, if earnings reach eight euros per share and applying a multiple of 20 times, the valuation could be close to 200 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:35:56">[10:35:56]</a>.

### Investment Opportunities in Fast Food: Restaurant Brands International
Restaurant Brands International (ticker: USB, listed in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:51:30">[12:51:30]</a> is currently trading at around 40 dollars per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:19">[12:54:19]</a>. The company owns iconic brands like Burger King, Popeyes, and Tim Hortons coffee shops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:47">[13:04:47]</a>. Its shares have fallen 50% from their highs, as restaurant stocks are not popular due to the economic shutdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:13:30">[13:13:30]</a>.

*   **Resilience:** Historically, fast-food stocks like McDonald's and Burger King have been excellent [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | investment ideas]], providing extraordinary returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:23:20">[13:23:20]</a>. Low-priced menus make them resilient during economic crises; McDonald's even increased sales in 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:47">[13:42:47]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** Restaurant Brands International operates on a franchise model, receiving royalties rather than operating restaurants directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:04">[13:55:04]</a>. This requires less investment, making it a "much better business" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:10">[13:59:10]</a>.
*   **Future Outlook:** It is likely that people will resume eating out once the current problem is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:22">[14:04:22]</a>. Fast-food restaurants may even benefit in difficult economic periods by gaining market share from more expensive restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:15:37">[14:15:37]</a>.
*   **Debt & Risk:** While the company has some debt, similar to other companies in the sector like McDonald's, Wendy's, or Domino's Pizza, these businesses can sustain more debt due to their resilience to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:45:00">[14:45:00]</a>. The risk associated with restaurant closures has been partially alleviated by the US government's stated intention to help small business owners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:04:46">[15:04:46]</a>.

#### Valuation
*   **Current Price:** Around 40 dollars per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:54:19">[12:54:19]</a>.
*   **Free Cash Flow (FCF):** The company generated $1.4 billion in free cash flow over the last 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:12:44">[15:12:44]</a>. FCF is similar to profit but with certain adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:18:22">[15:18:22]</a>.
*   **Valuation based on FCF:** Comparing FCF to the company's market capitalization of $11.7 billion yields an adjusted 8 times earnings, which is an attractive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:28:09">[15:28:09]</a>.
*   **Historical Trading:** Fast-food companies rarely trade for less than 15 times earnings; McDonald's traded at 14-15 times earnings during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:43:24">[15:43:24]</a>.
*   **Target Valuation (Economy Recovery):** Once the economy recovers, sales and earnings are expected to return to previous levels of $2.4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:55:03">[15:55:03]</a>. Valuing at 15 times earnings gives a target value of 80 dollars per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:03:36">[16:03:36]</a>.
*   **Target Valuation (Future Growth):** Restaurant Brands International plans to grow from 26,000 to 40,000 restaurants over the next 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:19:18">[16:19:18]</a>. This could increase profits from $1.4 billion to $2.0 billion per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:25:52">[16:25:52]</a>. Valuing these future profits at 15 times could result in a target value of 120 dollars per share in 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:35:46">[16:35:46]</a>.

In periods of [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainty | economic uncertainty]] and potential crises, gold often emerges as a crucial component of [[strategies_for_investing_during_economic_uncertainty | investment strategies]]. Renowned economist and investor Raidalio highlights gold's significance in safeguarding wealth and even profiting from challenging economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

## Raidalio's Perspective on Gold

Raidalio, one of the world's leading experts on the global economy and a top investor, emphasizes gold's unique role <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. He consistently advises investors to allocate a portion of their portfolio to gold-related [[investment opportunities in gold and nonUS stocks | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>.

> "For Raidalio, gold is the purest form of money, since no government can control it. And unlike the euro or the dollar, it can't be printed out of thin air and constantly devalued." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>

He recommends that investors hold between 10% and 15% of their portfolio in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>. This allocation is advised to protect against inflation and geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

## Reasons for Gold's Appeal

Several factors contribute to gold's status as a safe haven:

*   **Immunity to Government Control** Gold is considered the purest form of money because no government can control or devalue it by printing more, unlike fiat currencies such as the euro or dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.
*   **Protection Against Uncertainty** Geopolitical tensions increase demand for gold, causing its value to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>.
*   **Strong Performance in Crises** Gold has proven to provide real protection during economic downturns. For instance, it appreciated by 79% during a period when long-term US bonds, traditionally considered safe, lost 48% of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.
*   **Benefit for Gold Mining Companies** The current situation even benefits gold mining companies, as gold's value continues to rise while extraction costs (like oil and energy) have dropped drastically, creating an ideal economic scenario for them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.

## Current Trends and Accessibility

Recent economic trends underscore the growing interest in gold. There are significant gold imports into the United States, which is closely linked to Raidalio's negative economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>. This is partly due to central banks buying large amounts of gold to protect themselves from the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

### Gold Storage and Trade

*   Although central banks may not trust the United States for dollar [[investment opportunities in uncertain times | investments]], they trust it to guard gold, considering it the safest place in the world to store the metal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.
*   Most of the gold rapidly accumulated by central banks is deposited at the Federal Reserve's New York headquarters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.
*   This underground fortress is estimated to contain over 540,000 gold bars, weighing approximately 7,000 tons, buried more than 24 meters deep <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.

Investing in gold is now very accessible through various means:

*   **ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds)**: Famous gold ETFs like GLD, listed in the United States, make it easy to invest in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Gold Mining Companies**: Investing in companies that extract gold can also be a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

The role of gold in a [[the_role_of_gold_in_a_new_economic_environment | new economic environment]] is becoming increasingly vital for [[investment strategies during economic crises | protecting investments during economic crises]] and navigating periods of extreme uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. As of the time of this information, gold is trading at over $3,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] has been published, revealing an unprecedented accumulation of liquidity [00:00:08]. This significant cash pile could convey a message to investors [00:00:14]. [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] advises looking at his actions rather than just his words [00:00:37]. Currently, he is selling shares, accumulating liquidity, and has only been buying one share en masse [00:00:43].

## Current Portfolio Status: High Liquidity

As of the balance sheet dated September, [[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett's portfolio]] shows liquidity levels around 150-160 trillion dollars [03:01:00]. Berkshire Hathaway is currently the publicly traded company with the most liquidity [03:09:00], surpassing companies like [[Apple]] [[Google]] and [[Microsoft]] in this regard [03:14:00].

Since the fourth quarter of 2008, Berkshire Hathaway has increased its liquidity levels by 60% [03:45:00].

## Historical Context of Liquidity

Historically, significant liquidity accumulation by [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] has coincided with specific market conditions:
*   **Dot-com Bubble (1998-1999)**: As the stock market became expensive, [[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Warren Buffett's]] liquidity level surged from almost zero to 20 billion dollars [03:58:00]. Following this, the S&P 500 experienced problems [04:07:00].
*   **Post-Dot-com Correction**: Liquidity levels were reduced as [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]] began buying cheap shares [04:16:00].
*   **2007-2008 Financial Crisis**: Liquidity levels drastically increased from 2005 to 2008, indicating preparation before the crisis fully unfolded [04:35:00], though he wouldn't publicly declare a bubble [04:47:00]. After the 2008 correction, liquidity levels were again reduced in 2009 and 2010 as he deployed capital into cheap assets [04:59:00].

Currently, liquidity levels are at historical highs [05:20:00], and [[Warren Buffetts market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] is barely buying shares [05:24:00].

## Market Euphoria and Warnings

The current market exhibits high growth expectations for the Standard and Poor's 500, with levels for the 500 largest companies close to 20% [01:46:00]. This is higher than the 15% growth rates discounted during the dot-com bubble in 1999 or 2000 [01:57:00]. Peaks of euphoria and very high expectations have historically coincided with stock market problems [02:02:00].

[[Warren Buffetts market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]] has warned that the current pandemic and its ramifications might not be over [05:38:00]. He stated that society has struggled to prepare for difficult or remote but possible events that eventually happen [06:05:00].

Other reputable investors, like Stanley Druckenmiller, have also issued warnings [06:18:00]. Druckenmiller suggests that a bubble exists not only in the bond market but "everywhere" â€“ including cryptocurrencies, stocks, and speculative assets like art and wine [07:01:00]. He compares the situation to the dot-com bubble, where people discounted 20 years of future growth from the internet and new technologies [07:23:00]. The market tends to discount distant future events in a short period, leading to parabolic rises [08:02:00].

## [[Warren Buffetts 2021 investment portfolio | Warren Buffett's]] "Favorite Stock" in 2021: Berkshire Hathaway

[[Warren Buffetts current investment moves | Warren Buffett's]] favorite stock in 2021, given the money he is investing, appears to be Berkshire Hathaway itself [02:41:00]. In the first six months of 2021, he bought back 13 billion dollars of its shares [02:47:00].

Historically, every time [[Warren Buffetts current investment moves | Warren Buffett]] has bought back Berkshire Hathaway shares, they have shown a positive performance [02:58:00].
*   In 2011, he bought back shares at $70-80 when they fell below 1.2 times book value, and they almost doubled by 2014-2015 [03:09:00].
*   In 2016, shares dropped again, and buybacks were activated [03:09:00]. True Value invested in Berkshire Hathaway at this time, and the shares practically doubled over the next three years [03:36:00].
*   During the 2020 crisis, when shares fell to $160, True Value invested again [03:44:00]. The shares have since evolved to $280 [03:59:00].

Although the stock is at historical highs, [[Warren Buffetts current investment moves | Warren Buffett]] has reactivated share purchases [04:09:00], prioritizing his own company over buying private businesses or other shares [04:16:00].

The book value per share of Berkshire Hathaway is estimated to be around $230 by next year [04:26:00], and it has historically grown at a rate of 10% per year [04:33:00]. [[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Warren Buffett]] has stated that Berkshire shares should be valued at 1.6 times book value for a fair valuation [04:59:00]. Given this, and an estimated future book value of $300 in three to four years, the intrinsic value could reach $480 [05:27:00]. This makes his own stock a logical favorite [05:40:00], as he believes Berkshire is built to be a long-lasting company [05:48:00].

## Other Recent Investments

During the most recent quarter, [[Warren Buffetts current investment moves | Warren Buffett]] (or his sub-managers) largely reduced or sold off most shareholdings [05:59:00]. However, he did add a small amount to Chevron and bought new shares in two companies:

1.  **Royalty Pharma**: This company buys the rights to pharmaceutical drugs, receiving a percentage of sales (5-10%) from laboratories in exchange for financing their development and distribution [06:33:00]. It operates with hardly any expenses [06:53:00]. It grew by about 24% compared to the previous year [07:19:00] and generates significant free cash flow around 2 billion dollars, capitalizing around 17 billion [07:29:00]. Risks include patent expiration, which can cause benefits to drop as generics enter the market [07:48:00]. The company expects a 10-15 year lifespan for its current patents [08:16:00]. [[Warren Buffetts market insights and strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s investment in this type of royalty business is interesting given his past comments on inflation, as these companies have already made investments with "old dollars" and can raise prices with inflation without increasing costs [08:32:00].
2.  **Floor & Decor**: This company is a manufacturer and distributor of various types of flooring, including synthetic and wood [09:03:00]. Their strategy involves opening new stores and an online presence with simulation tools [09:31:00]. They also offer in-house designers or advisors [09:48:00]. The company's turnover grew tenfold from 300 million dollars in 2011 to 3.2 billion in the last 12 months [09:04:00], with pre-tax profits increasing from 20 million to almost 400 million [09:18:00]. The flooring business, contrary to common belief, is largely driven by renovations, not just new constructions, making it less cyclical [09:33:00]. The current valuation of around 60 times earnings is demanding [09:36:00], but [[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Warren Buffett's]] long-term vision anticipates significant earnings growth (e.g., five times more in 7-8 years) [09:50:00].

## Investment Principles from [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett]]

[[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] operates based on three basic premises for investing in a crisis [09:13:00]:
1.  **Quality Stocks**: Investing in good businesses with high confidence that they will continue to earn more money in 5, 10, or 15 years [09:17:00].
2.  **Sensible Valuation**: Buying these quality businesses at a sensible valuation [09:27:00].
3.  **Long-Term Vision**: Taking advantage of moments of panic to buy [09:00:00]. Historically, market drops of more than 10% have shown positive subsequent performance over five years [09:22:00], with the exception of the 1998 dot-com bubble due to extremely expensive starting valuations [09:51:00].

[[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Warren Buffett]]'s approach emphasizes understanding the intrinsic value of a company and letting time allow the market price to align with that value [12:12:00]. He often estimates long-term benefits of a company to determine its value [12:45:00], rather than relying solely on discounted cash flow methods [11:31:00]. His success has largely come from a select group of around 20 "compounder" stocks (e.g., Gillette, Coca-Cola, American Express) that consistently increase their intrinsic value [12:12:00]. These businesses are typically stable, non-cyclical, and were bought at reasonable prices, allowing them to compound value over many years [12:12:00].

## Risk Management and Long-Term Vision

Investing in the stock market involves risks, volatility, and uncertainty [01:04:00]. Peaks of euphoria, where people have very high expectations, often precede market problems [02:02:00]. Similarly, companies showing abnormally high profits compared to historical averages can be risky, as they might be "overearning" [09:39:00].

The average period of owning a stock today is between two and three months, indicating a tremendously short-term focus in the market [11:13:00]. However, for long-term investors, time is often the friend of good businesses [13:23:00]. Even if a mistake is made in valuation, if the business continues to grow, the overvaluation can be "digested" over time, leading to good performance [13:28:00]. This strategy focuses more on predicting the future of the company than being overly demanding about the initial valuation [13:42:00].

When a company publishes results, investors should assess whether the profit-generating power or competitive advantage of the company remains intact in the long term, rather than overreacting to short-term fluctuations [11:38:00]. If the fundamental strategy or value does not change, market volatility should not cause panic [11:51:00]. Instead, it can be an opportunity to expand positions if liquidity is available [11:47:00].

Investing in highly overvalued stocks, like some technology stocks during the dot-com bubble, can lead to significant losses, with many internet stocks falling 98% and the Nasdaq falling 80% from peak to trough [13:52:00]. It's crucial for investors to have a minimum level of knowledge and training to avoid blindly investing in bubbles or making poor decisions [12:06:00].

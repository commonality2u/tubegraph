[[Michael Burrys investment style and achievements | Michael Burry]] is an investor known for his unique approach, combining value investing with significant macroeconomic bets. He is not a typical market commentator, but rather someone who "puts his money on the table" with his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:48">[04:57:48]</a>. His investment approach focuses on finding asymmetric investments, where the potential loss is small, but the potential gain is large <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:32:04">[06:32:04]</a>.

## Key Predictions and Achievements

[[Michael Burrys stock market predictions | Michael Burry]] has a notable track record of predicting major market events:
*   He predicted the dot-com bubble in the early 2000s, even warning about it on internet forums as a small investor before managing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:04:17">[05:04:17]</a>.
*   He famously warned of the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis, which was later depicted in the movie "The Big Short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:15">[05:17:15]</a>. He benefited significantly in both instances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.
*   His returns during his public period with Scion Capital demonstrate his quality as an investor; he practically doubled his capital in the first three years while the S&P 500 fell by 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. In 2007, he achieved a 166% return from the subprime mortgages bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:09:07">[06:09:07]</a>.

## Current Investment Portfolio and Market Predictions

[[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | Burry's current portfolio]] reflects his recent [[Michael Burrys stock movements and market predictions | market predictions]] and macroeconomic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>. His portfolio is highly concentrated, with 70% of his positions being new in the latest report <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:00">[09:52:00]</a>.

### Inflation Bet
[[Michael Burrys market predictions and their implications | Burry]] has publicly warned about an impending period of high inflation over the coming months or years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:36:00">[05:36:00]</a>. He has structured his portfolio to benefit from assets that will go up and those that will go down in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:00">[05:47:00]</a>.

He draws an analogy between the current inflation and that of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s, noting that the period of money printing has been ongoing since 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:05:00">[15:05:00]</a>. Unlike previous quantitative easing, where money did not reach the real economy, current stimulus checks mean people are spending, driving up demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:26:00">[16:26:00]</a>. Additionally, supply chain problems are causing raw material prices (steel, copper, aluminum, wood) to skyrocket <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:51:00">[16:51:00]</a>. This leads to companies raising prices, followed by wage increases, creating a cycle of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>. Eventually, central banks will have to raise interest rates to control inflation, which will cause bond prices to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a>.

His significant bets against inflation include:
*   **Put options on TLT (iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF)**: This represents a $170 million position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:53:00">[14:53:00]</a>. When inflation rises, interest rates typically increase, causing bonds to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:37:00">[11:37:00]</a>. This strategy uses put options to leverage the bet with limited risk (the premium paid for the options) and high upside potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:47:00">[11:47:00]</a>.
*   **Inverse ETF on bonds (TBT)**: This is an inverse ETF that goes up when bonds go down, leveraged by two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:13:00]</a>. He has further leveraged this with options, which is a "negative carry trade" as it costs money to maintain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:22:00">[13:22:00]</a>.

### Bearish Bet on Tesla
[[key_stock_investments_by_michael_burry | Michael Burry]] has made a "massive" bearish investment in Tesla, amounting to about $500 million, or 40% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00">[01:27:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:12:00">[10:12:00]</a>. He believes the entire automobile industry earning $100 million would not justify Tesla's valuation of 20-30 trillion dollars, which is almost 95% less than its current capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. He argues that other manufacturers will also develop autonomous car software <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:51:00">[10:51:00]</a>. This bet is structured through put options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:00">[11:15:00]</a>, specifically mentioning January 2023 contracts with a strike price of $400, where there is significant open interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:37:00">[27:37:00]</a>.

### Bullish Bets on Google and Facebook
Despite being bearish on many high-growth technology stocks, [[Michael Burrys significant stock picks | Burry]] has made massive bullish bets on Facebook and Google shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:30:00">[12:30:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:34:00">[12:34:00]</a>. He made an investment of $300 million in these companies, also structured with call options to benefit from leveraged upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:39:00">[32:39:00]</a>.

His rationale for these investments includes:
*   **Operational Leverage**: Both companies are in a phase where sales are increasing significantly, but costs remain almost the same due to their established technological infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:03:00">[34:03:00]</a>. This leads to disproportionate growth in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:36:00">[34:36:00]</a>.
*   **Market Share Gains**: Google has taken market share from traditional television and newspapers, a process accelerated by the recent crisis and confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:06:00">[35:06:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Google is described as having "probably the company with the greatest competitive advantage worldwide" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:54:00">[35:54:00]</a>.
*   **Reasonable Multiples**: Unlike some tech companies trading at very high earnings multiples, Google and Facebook are considered to have a "cheap multiple" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:01:00">[36:01:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:04:00">[36:04:00]</a>.

## Regulatory Scrutiny and Public Commentary

[[Investment strategies and advice from Michael Burry | Michael Burry's]] Twitter account, which he used to issue warnings about market bubbles and inflation, no longer exists <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. He received a visit from the American regulator (SEC) regarding his social media activity, as they believed it was causing "financial panic" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>. This led to his decision to stop tweeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.

## Broader Investment Principles

*   **Identifying Bubbles**: Burry warns about "euphoria" in various assets, including meme stocks like GameStop and AMC, cloud software companies, and disruptive technology firms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:44:00">[43:44:00]</a>. He compares the current market speculation to the Weimar Republic era when even "the elevator operator" was playing in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:38:00">[41:38:00]</a>. He highlights that Robinhood's app crashing due to high trading volume is a powerful signal of excessive speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:23:00">[42:23:00]</a>.
*   **Caution with Cryptocurrencies**: While not outright bearish on Bitcoin, Burry warns about the significant leverage involved in the crypto market, the risk of government regulation, and the lack of regulation akin to the "wild west" in early stock markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:13:00">[47:13:00]</a>. He notes the presence of "frauds" and speculative behavior in the crypto space <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:20:00">[46:20:00]</a>.
*   **Importance of Informed Decisions**: He advises investors to avoid being "tourists" in the stock market and to make informed decisions by understanding risks, valuations, and company debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:34:00">[44:34:00]</a>. He stresses learning how to analyze stocks and avoiding "smoke sellers" who promise high benefits without real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:49:00">[44:49:00]</a>.
*   **Value Investing in Commodities**: He holds a positive view on certain raw materials due to inflation, recommending Canadian Natural Resources (oil and gas producer) due to its high reserves, low debt, and low valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:50:00">[50:50:00]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="55:07:00">[55:07:00]</a>. He also notes that mining companies like copper producers could benefit significantly from rising prices as costs remain stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:21:00">[11:21:00]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Sector**: Burry is invested in the healthcare sector, which he believes performs well during inflation as it is an essential service allowing price increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:32">[01:03:32]</a>. An example is DaVita, a dialysis clinic company, which he has significantly increased his position in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:48">[01:03:48]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks**: He sees share buybacks as a strong signal that a company believes its shares are cheap and a good investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:58">[01:08:58]</a>.

### Reporting Requirements
Large investors managing over $100 million in the US are required to report their holdings quarterly via a 13F filing to the SEC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This information becomes public six weeks after the quarter ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>.

The global economy is entering a "new world economic order" that is anticipated to bring significant economic and social reforms with serious implications for both the [[stock_market_crisis | stock market]] and the economy [00:00:07]. Renowned investor Ray Dalio has warned that this new scenario could lead to a major crisis in the U.S. and globally [00:00:23]. This article outlines the nature of this new order and [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | strategies to protect investments]] and savings, drawing from Ray Dalio's recommendations.

## Ray Dalio: The "Steve Jobs of Financial Markets"

Ray Dalio is a prominent figure in the investment world, managing $100 billion through his company, Bridgewater [00:01:01]. He is often called the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the high reliability of his economic and [[stock_market_crisis | stock market]] predictions [00:01:06]. Dalio is also a respected author and speaker, participating in key events such as the World Economic Forum in Davos [00:01:14].

## The Coming New World Economic Order

Dalio identifies a "great cycle" in global economics, noting that the current world order began in 1945 after World War II, establishing the dollar as a world reserve currency and a dominant power [00:01:31]. This period led to peace and prosperity, but it is now "about to change" [00:01:48]. Political extremism in the U.S. is expected to accelerate this shift towards a new economic order [00:01:53].

### Phases of Economic Decline
Through historical study, Dalio has identified that every dominant economy, like the U.S. for the past 70 years, undergoes phases of economic rise and decline [00:02:20]. The U.S. is reportedly entering a phase of decline, characterized by:
*   High levels of debt in the system [00:02:44]
*   Alarming quantities of money printing [00:02:47]
*   Increased economic and social inequality [00:02:50]

Conversely, China is currently in an upward phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation [00:02:54].

### Consequences of Money Printing
Since the 2008 [[investment_strategies_during_a_financial_crisis | financial crisis]], the U.S. Federal Reserve has printed record amounts of money, increasing its balance sheet from $1 trillion to over $7 trillion [00:03:13]. This growth far surpasses that of the general economy [00:03:26].

This "economic experiment" has led to:
*   Inflation levels not seen in decades [00:03:30]
*   Significant increases in the price of raw materials, products, goods, and services [00:03:38]

The concept of "helicopter money," where large amounts of new bills are printed and distributed to stimulate consumption after an [[investment_strategies_in_an_economic_downturn | economic recession]], was implemented in 2020 through $1,200 checks to American citizens [00:03:57]. However, Dalio argues that simply printing money is not a sustainable solution, as countries like Zimbabwe demonstrate; this recipe has historically led to ruin in nations such as Germany, Argentina, Venezuela, and Spain [00:04:24].

### Economic Inequality and Societal Impact
Ray Dalio highlights an "extreme level of economic inequality" in the U.S. [00:05:10]. For example, three individuals (like Jeff Bezos) hold more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) [00:05:15]. The richest 1% of the American economy has continuously prospered over the last 40 years, accumulating more wealth [00:05:27].

Historically, such social inequality leads to three major [[investment_strategies_during_economic_instability | economic problems]] affecting savings and investments [00:05:37]:
1.  **Increased Taxes**: Taxes are expected to rise globally, negatively impacting the [[stock_market_crisis | stock market]] by decreasing company profits [00:05:44].
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions**: The Federal Reserve has indicated future interest rate hikes, which would negatively affect highly indebted companies [00:06:00].
3.  **New Regulations and Wealth Redistribution**: Increased regulations and measures to redistribute wealth would adversely affect nearly all types of investments [00:06:13].

## [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | Investment Strategies for Economic Crises]]

In this [[investment_strategies_in_an_economic_downturn | economic environment]], the worst approach is to sell everything and hold liquidity, as the value of money will decrease due to inflation [00:06:28]. Instead, it is crucial to remain invested in the "correct investments" [00:06:37].

### Ray Dalio's Portfolio Philosophy
Ray Dalio suggests having at least 40% of an [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | investment portfolio]] in stocks, as they tend to perform well in this new economic scenario [00:06:47].

### Promising Investment Sectors
A Bank of America study covering 50 years of [[stock_market_crisis | stock market]] data indicates that in a scenario of rising inflation, the best-performing sectors are:
1.  **Energy Sector** [00:07:37]
2.  **Raw Materials Sector** [00:07:41]

### Recommended Investment Opportunities

#### 1. Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)
This company is one of Canada's largest oil and energy producers, listed on the U.S. [[stock_market_crisis | stock exchange]] under the ticker CNQ at $32 per share [00:07:45]. It produces over one million barrels of oil daily from high-quality lands with low extraction costs [00:07:56]. Despite sideways performance in recent years due to low inflation, the company has an attractive valuation [00:08:05]. It has a track record of increasing dividends for the last 20 years, even through the 2008 [[investment_strategies_during_a_financial_crisis | financial crisis]] [00:08:17]. CNQ currently trades at only four times EBITDA, compared to a historical sector average of around six times [00:08:26]. If Dalio's scenario materializes, increased inflation could boost profits and valuation multiples, potentially raising the intrinsic value significantly [00:08:47].

#### 2. Gold (GLD, IGSG.DE / ISHARES GOLD GN)
Ray Dalio considers gold an investment that will "always perform well" if the new world order materializes [00:09:16]. He recommends allocating at least 10% of a portfolio to gold investments [00:09:22]. The printing of money consistently decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth towards financial assets, historically raising the price of gold and stocks [00:09:32]. Since March 2020, gold has risen from $1,500 to $1,800 an ounce [00:09:43].

Ways to invest in gold:
*   **Gold ETFs**: The easiest method is to buy a gold ETF that tracks the metal's performance [00:09:59]. The largest globally is GLD, trading at $169 per share [00:10:04]. For European investors, iShares trades under the ticker GN at â‚¬30 per share [00:10:24].
*   **Gold Mining Companies**: Investing in gold mining companies is more complex due to operational risks (floods, landslides, strikes) [00:10:31]. However, if gold prices rise, these investments can appreciate significantly more than gold itself [00:10:46]. To mitigate individual company risk, one can invest in a gold mining ETF like GDX [00:10:51].

#### 3. Personal Defense Products (AXON)
One stock that could perform well in a scenario of social inequality and potential conflict is companies manufacturing personal defense products, such as Axon Enterprise Inc. (AXON) [00:12:04]. Since 2008, as social inequality increased, Axon's shares have appreciated from $6 to over $75 due to high demand for its products [00:12:17]. These shares trade at a valuation of 11 times this year's earnings, compared to a historical average of 16 times, suggesting potential for appreciation [00:12:29]. If Dalio's scenario materializes, their potential could be "much, much higher" [00:12:42].

## Ray Dalio's Biggest Risk: Government Bankruptcy

Ray Dalio's greatest concern is the risk of government bankruptcy following economic shocks, especially when coupled with high economic inequality and class differences [00:11:28]. He emphasizes that historically, the "single most important advanced indicator of wars and revolutions is the bankruptcy of governments" [00:11:38]. While not an immediate threat, he warns that if the economy continues its current trajectory, it could reach an inflection point with severe consequences [00:11:56].

Inflation has become a significant concern, with figures reaching around 4-5% in recent months, climbing faster than in previous periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This drastically alters the investment landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. [[Warren Buffetts perspectives on inflation and economic crises | Warren Buffett]] has explicitly warned that inflation could be more prolonged than anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>, noting that they are seeing significant inflation and rising prices which consumers are currently accepting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>. Other prominent investors like [[Warren Buffetts perspectives on inflation and economic crises | Charlie Munger]] and [[Warren Buffetts perspectives on inflation and economic crises | Ray Dalio]] have also raised similar warnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] emphasizes that inflation acts as an "additional tax" on investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. If inflation is 5% and safe investments yield 5%, it's effectively a 100% tax rate, confiscating all profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Money held in fixed-term deposits or liquidity loses value over time due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. For instance, the U.S. dollar has lost 80-90% of its value over 40-50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

## Key Investment Principles During Inflation

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] provides clues on how to invest effectively during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. His core philosophy, based on his experience investing in times of high inflation, is generally considered valid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>.

### The "Toll Bridge" Metaphor
[[Warren Buffetts investment principles | Warren Buffett]] famously uses the "toll bridge" metaphor to describe ideal investments in an inflationary environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This refers to companies that:
*   **Have already made the bulk of their investment:** They've built their infrastructure or brand with "old dollars" (i.e., at historical costs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **Do not require continuous significant reinvestment:** They don't need to constantly replace or upgrade their core assets to maintain or grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>.
*   **Can raise prices easily:** Their products or services are essential, ensuring continuous demand, allowing them to increase prices in line with or above inflation without losing customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>.

This leads to a disproportionate increase in profits because income rises while costs remain relatively stable or grow slower than inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[01:11:52]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities

The following are five examples of investment opportunities that align with [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights | Warren Buffett's]] recommendations for inflationary environments:

### 1. Moody's (Rating Agency)
*   **Fits "Toll Bridge"**: Moody's has already built its brand image and reputation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. It's a recurring business that requires minimal ongoing investment, allowing it to raise prices at or above the pace of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Provides debt ratings, a necessary service regardless of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Financials**: Operating cash flow has significantly increased (from $1 billion to an estimated $2.5 billion by next year), while capital expenditures have risen minimally (from $74 million in 2014 to $94 million in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. This disparity leads to soaring free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>.
*   **Market Position**: Part of an oligopoly, providing significant value (e.g., saving companies $15 million in interest over a 10-year bond life for a $2.5 million fee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Performance**: The stock has nearly tripled since 2016, demonstrating robust performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### 2. Gold Royalty Companies (e.g., Franco-Nevada)
*   **Fits "Toll Bridge"**: These companies finance gold mining projects and receive a percentage of future gold production (royalties) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:20">[00:24:20]</a>. They've made their primary investment in the past by financing the mine's setup <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:46">[00:24:46]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Gold mining companies often struggle with traditional financing, so royalty companies fill a niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:41">[00:24:41]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**: As gold prices rise with inflation, their income increases, but their costs (already invested) remain fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:07">[00:25:07]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Franco-Nevada has given a 20% annual return since its inception in 2007, outperforming Nasdaq, S&P 500, gold itself, and even other gold mining companies which showed negative returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>.

### 3. MTEN (Restaurant Franchise Royalties)
*   **Fits "Toll Bridge"**: MTEN owns the rights to fast-food franchises, collecting a percentage of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:08">[00:28:08]</a>. Their core investment (buying franchise rights) was made in "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:37">[00:29:37]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Fast food performs well even during crises or high inflation because it's a competitive and often cheaper alternative to cooking at home or more expensive restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:40">[00:27:40]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**: If restaurant menu prices rise due to inflation, MTEN's revenue automatically increases, while their central costs remain largely fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:19">[00:29:19]</a>. The burden of rising food and labor costs falls on the franchisee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>.
*   **Efficiency**: The company can support 50% more sales with the same central staff <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Despite an average annual growth of 15% in recent years, it's trading at a relatively low 11 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a>.

### 4. Residential REITs (Real Estate Investment Trusts)
*   **Fits "Toll Bridge"**: REITs have already acquired or built their properties with "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: Residential apartments offer very predictable and recurrent income, with high occupancy rates (e.g., 95%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:19">[00:34:19]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**: Rental contracts are often linked to the Consumer Price Index (CPI) or inflation, allowing rents to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. Additionally, property values appreciate with inflation, while fixed-rate debt remains constant, providing a double benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Strategy**: Companies like the one discussed have a low debt-to-equity ratio (below 50%) and use interest rate hedges to protect against rising rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a>.
*   **Performance**: Rents are being raised by 6% on renewals and 15% on new rentals, outpacing U.S. inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:50">[00:36:50]</a>.

### 5. Financial Companies (e.g., Automotive Loan Providers)
*   **Fits "Old Dollars" Principle**: Financial companies extend loans, which are their primary "investment" made with "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:56">[00:52:56]</a>.
*   **Inflation Hedge**: In inflationary environments, interest rates tend to rise, benefiting banks and financial companies as their income from new loans increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:03">[00:53:03]</a>. Additionally, as clients' cash flow increases with inflation, loan repayment solvency may improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Banks were among the best-performing sectors during the inflationary period of the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>.

## Conclusion on Investment Strategy

The current market is characterized by high valuations and zero interest rates, with expectations of rate hikes in 2022 or 2023, suggesting potential market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:46">[00:32:46]</a>. The best solution is to be sensitive to valuation, invest in high-quality businesses, and consider how inflation might affect them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:35">[00:38:35]</a>. The goal is to choose companies that can perform well in any economic environment, with or without inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

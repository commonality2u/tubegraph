A new risk for the stock market, termed the reverse crisis, is becoming increasingly possible, potentially impacting capital and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. This scenario is closely linked to inflation and the decisions made by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. Some prominent investors, including Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, and Stanley Druckenmiller, have already issued warnings about this evolving market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:00">[00:24:00]</a>.

## Understanding the Reverse Financial Crisis

A reverse financial crisis is fundamentally connected to inflation and the monetary policies implemented by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. In this scenario, just like the prices of products and services, investments begin a rapid escalation that appears to have no end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:00">[02:07:00]</a>. While this might initially seem positive, it carries significant dangers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>.

### Causes

The primary drivers of a reverse financial crisis include:
*   **Monetary Expansion** The Federal Reserve and other central banks have been flooding the financial system with new currencies (euros, dollars, pounds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:00">[01:05:00]</a>. Since 2008, printing new money has been a consistent solution to financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>. For instance, in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars currently in circulation were printed, a remarkable figure for a currency with 200 years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.
*   **Government Fiscal Deficits** Governments are increasingly spending more money than they collect through taxes, necessitating increased borrowing and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:00">[01:33:00]</a>. This weakens a currency and fuels inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>. The United States deficit, for example, stands at 8%, nearing levels seen during the [[comparison_of_current_market_conditions_with_historical_financial_crises | 2008 crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. Warren Buffett has also commented on this issue, stating that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:01:00">[07:01:00]</a>.
*   **Negative Real Interest Rates** These crises are strongly correlated with [[negative_interest_rates_and_their_implications | negative real interest rates]], which occur when the inflation rate surpasses the interest rate set by a country's Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:11:00">[05:11:00]</a>. Argentina experienced a negative average real interest rate of at least 6% over 12 years, leading to severe inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:23:00">[05:23:00]</a>. Europe and the United States also saw negative real rates of 3-4% during 2021-2022, albeit for a shorter 12-24 month period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>.

### Consequences

The widespread printing of money and rising deficits have led to one of the largest inflation crises in the last 40 years, radically transforming the economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.

*   **Loss of Purchasing Power** In a reverse crisis, the price of services and products increases faster than the value of money, resulting in a loss of purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This is a "silent problem" often ignored until it is too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Nominal vs. Real Returns** An investment's nominal return may appear positive (e.g., 10% gain), but if inflation is higher (e.g., 15%), the real return is negative (e.g., -5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. For example, from 2021 to now, accumulated inflation is 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:00">[03:56:00]</a>. The S&P 500, to compensate for this, would have needed to rise to 5700 points but is currently at 5200 points, representing a 10% loss in purchasing power for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>. Those who did not invest at all experienced a total loss of 20% in purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Highs** This environment causes main stock market indices to rise very strongly, with most reaching historical highs due to the reverse crisis effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.
*   **Future Inflation Waves** Many large investors fear a second, higher wave of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:00">[05:55:00]</a>. A study by the Apollo Group suggests that inflation moves in waves, and when the Fed lowers rates, it tends to raise inflation, as seen in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. The Apollo Group estimates a new increase in inflation and negative real interest rates could occur within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:26:00">[06:26:00]</a>. Business Insider magazine notes that "extreme inflation is always a possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:11:00">[07:11:00]</a>.

## Historical Examples

This type of [[historical_examples_of_reverse_financial_crises_in_global_markets | reverse crisis]] has already occurred in the main stock markets of countries like Germany, Argentina, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>.
*   **Argentina (Merval Index)**: Multiplied by 60 times in the last 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>.
*   **Turkey**: Rose 700% in just 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>.
*   **Germany**: Saw an 800% rise in less than 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:00">[02:39:00]</a>.

## Protecting Capital and Savings

[[preparing_for_market_crises | Managing Risks in Economic Downturns]] and [[preparing_for_market_crises | preparing for market crises]] requires strategic investment choices. During a reverse financial crisis, investing in stocks is generally preferred over bonds, as bonds tend to suffer in negative real rate environments, leading to a reduction in purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:00">[07:35:00]</a>.

### Investment Strategies

*   **Inflation-Benefiting Sectors**: If high inflation is anticipated, sectors like gold miners and real estate (REITs) tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>. Bonds are the only investment category with a negative return in relation to inflation, while other sectors offer varying degrees of protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:03:00">[08:03:00]</a>. However, these sectors can have poor performance relative to the market average in non-inflationary periods due to their lower quality and higher volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

*   **Warren Buffett's Approach: Pricing Power**: Warren Buffett advocates for businesses with strong brands and competitive advantages that allow them to raise prices at a rate equal to or greater than inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a>. This "pricing power" is crucial in inflationary environments as it ensures profits rise faster than inflation, reflecting value creation in the stock market and protecting against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:02:00">[09:02:00]</a>. These businesses also tend to perform well even outside of reverse crisis scenarios, offering consistent and predictable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. This strategy allows investors to prepare a portfolio for many economic environments without needing to predict future economic or central bank decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a>.

Credit Suisse has compiled a list of 25 large-cap stocks known for their significant pricing power, including iconic names like Walmart, Microsoft, Campbell, Philip Morris, and Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Many of these companies have been invested in by Warren Buffett and have performed well over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:21:00">[10:21:00]</a>.

Warren Buffett, considered the greatest investor of all time, revealed seven basic principles he used to achieve tremendous success in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00"></a>. A core piece of his advice, particularly for beginners, is to [[Investment Opportunities in Quality Stocks | invest in good companies]] and avoid mediocre businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:00"></a>.

## Characteristics of Exceptional Businesses

Exceptional businesses are those that generate significant long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00"></a>. They are capable of multiplying their shares by 8, 10, 20, or even 50 times in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:00"></a>. Key indicators include:
*   **Constant Growth in Earnings per Share** They consistently show growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00"></a>.
*   **Strong Stock Performance** If a company's stock has not multiplied several times on the stock market over the last 10 or 20 years, it is likely not a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00"></a>.
*   [[Understanding companies before investing | Understanding the Business Model]] It is easy to understand how the company makes money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:00"></a>.
*   **Few Risks** They have few risks that could lead to the company's downfall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00"></a>.
*   **Predictable Future Profits** It can be estimated that the company will generate increasing and stable profits in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00"></a>.
*   **Stable Sector with Tailwinds** They operate in stable sectors that often have positive tailwinds, such as the medical equipment sector benefiting from an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:16:00"></a>.

## Benefits of Investing in Exceptional Businesses

Investing in exceptional businesses, even if they are trading at a slightly higher valuation, offers two major advantages:
*   **Efficiency in Analysis** Investors perform the analysis work only once and can theoretically benefit from returns for many years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:00"></a>.
*   **Compounding Returns** Investors tremendously benefit from the compound capitalization effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:00"></a>.

## Avoiding Mediocre Businesses

Warren Buffett advises against getting interested in stocks of low-quality businesses, even if they appear cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00"></a>. While such stocks might offer a quick 30-40% gain, they do not generate long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00"></a>. Consequently, they do not allow investors to benefit from the compound capitalization effect, as these shares typically need to be sold quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:00"></a>. Filling a portfolio with such situations usually results in mediocre long-term performance because relying on always buying at the bottom and selling quickly is not sustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00"></a>.

### Examples of Mediocre vs. Exceptional Performance

*   **General Motors (Mediocre Example)**: Over the last 10 years, General Motors' stock price has shown little movement, offering only short periods of 30-40% gains that require prompt selling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00"></a>. It is not a stock that multiplies several times in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00"></a>.
*   **Moody's (Exceptional Example)**: Moody's (ticker: MC) has multiplied by more than 10 times on the stock market in the last 10 years, demonstrating its status as an extraordinary company that generates significant long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00"></a>.

## How to Identify Good Businesses

To [[Identifying good investment opportunities | identify good businesses]], two main methods are suggested:
1.  **Studying Company Fundamentals**: This involves understanding the company's operations, its profit and loss account, and its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00"></a>. A key focus should be on companies that have demonstrated constant growth in terms of earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:00"></a>.
2.  **Analyzing Stock Performance**: A more accessible method for beginners is to observe a stock's historical performance. If a company has not multiplied its value several times on the stock market over the past 10 or 20 years, it is likely not a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00"></a>.

### Examples of Exceptional Companies as Investments

*   **McDonald's (MCD)**: Warren Buffett favors McDonald's as an investment because technological changes do not affect basic human needs like eating. It's easy to understand how the company makes money, has few risks, and is expected to generate increasing long-term profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:00"></a>. Its shares have multiplied by over three times in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00"></a>.
*   **Stryker (SYK)**: As a leading medical equipment manufacturer, Stryker operates in a stable sector with tailwinds from population aging. It is estimated to generate increasing and stable profits in the future, with potential for 10% annual profit growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:38:00"></a>. Despite market corrections, its fundamental business strength remains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00"></a>.
*   **Other Examples**: Other companies like Apple (AAPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00"></a>, Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00"></a>, American Express <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:09:00"></a>, Tesla (TSLA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:32:00"></a>, Disney (DIS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00"></a>, and Amazon (AMZN) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:03:00"></a> have also demonstrated characteristics of exceptional businesses through their long-term performance and fundamental strength.

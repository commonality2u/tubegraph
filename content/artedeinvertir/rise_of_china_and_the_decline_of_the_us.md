Ray Dalio, a renowned economist and investor, predicts that the "new world order" will usher in an unprecedented economic recession [00:00:04]. He identifies three major challenges, which he considers the most significant of our lives [00:00:17]. According to Dalio, an economic war is brewing that will lead to the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | decline of the United States]] and its allies in favor of [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] [00:00:21]. He has even specified that the economic outlook will drastically change within the next five years [00:00:28], [00:03:54]. This shift will have significant consequences on the value of money, investments, and currencies like the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | dollar]] [00:00:33].

## Ray Dalio's Influence and Predictions

Ray Dalio holds substantial global economic power and influence [00:01:13]. He is a regular attendee at the Davos forum and founded the world's largest hedge fund, managing over 100 trillion dollars in assets [00:01:17]. His opinions are highly respected due to his successful navigation of major economic crises, such as those in 2000 and 2008 [00:01:28]. His insights into this new economic scenario are detailed in his book, *The New World Order* [00:01:48].

### The Three Forces Driving Economic Change

Dalio highlights three critical forces that, when occurring simultaneously, have historically led to economic recessions, the fall of empires, and the decline of major world currencies [00:02:00]:

1.  **Class Struggle:**
    *   There is a growing "class struggle" between capitalism and communism, and between those who have and those who do not [00:02:15].
    *   The social gap between classes is widening [00:02:27].
    *   In the United States, the wealthiest 1% increasingly own more wealth, while the poorest 50% own less [00:02:33].
    *   Recent inflation has exacerbated this gap, disproportionately affecting those without assets like stocks or real estate [00:02:43].

2.  **Enormous Debt:**
    *   The United States and Europe carry an enormous amount of debt [00:03:16].
    *   There is diminishing demand for United States debt, and American bonds are considered a very risky investment [00:03:21].
    *   Dalio suggests two potential outcomes: either the interest rate for the debt increases, or the state will be forced to print more money [00:03:28].
    *   Printing more money to solve recessions will generate higher inflation, further increasing the gap between classes [00:03:40].

3.  **Rise of China and Decline of the US:**
    *   Dalio warns of the [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | rise of China]] and the [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | United States entering into decline]] [00:04:35].
    *   This shift will significantly affect the value of the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | dollar]] and its status as a [[decline_of_the_us_dollar_as_world_reserve_currency | global reserve currency]] [00:04:41].
    *   For the past 70 years, the United States has dominated the international political landscape by controlling institutions such as the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, but this is poised to change [00:04:46].
    *   The United States is entering a "decline phase" characterized by high levels of debt, social struggles, and currency devaluation [00:04:59].
    *   Meanwhile, [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] is in an "ascending phase" of wealth creation and debt accumulation [00:05:10].

### Investment Recommendations

Given this complex environment, Dalio offers two key recommendations for investors:

1.  **Invest Globally to Combat Inflation:**
    *   Investors must look at their investments globally [00:05:25].
    *   The primary goal should be to prevent money from losing value due to inflation, and the only way to do this is to invest [00:05:29].
    *   The value of assets like stocks and gold has risen due to the creation of new debt and money [00:05:35].
    *   Dalio advises against holding "safe" assets like liquidity or fixed income, as their value typically decreases in inflationary scenarios [00:05:43].
    *   Real assets with consistent demand, such as stocks, real estate investments, or gold, are expected to perform much better [00:06:10].

2.  **Diversify Without Reducing Performance Expectation:**
    *   In a world of uncertainty and risk, it is crucial to learn to diversify effectively [00:06:21].
    *   Good diversification can reduce risk by 80% [00:06:31].
    *   Dalio typically recommends investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks [00:06:35].
    *   He popularized the "four seasons" portfolio management theory for powerful diversification [00:06:43].

#### Ray Dalio's Current Investment Preferences

Dalio's current portfolio reflects his views:
*   **Preferred Sector:** Technology, with holdings in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa [00:06:57].
*   **Reduced Holdings:** The banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, likely to avoid issues sensitive to the economic cycle [00:07:07].
*   **Shift from Bonds:** While typically holding a significant portion of his portfolio in debt or long-term bonds, his main positions are now in stocks [00:07:33].
*   **Stable/Defensive Consumer Companies:** Businesses like Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, or Pepsi are also favored [00:07:50].
*   **Small-Cap Stocks:** He has invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF (IWM), which tends to perform better than the market average when interest rates drop and liquidity increases [00:08:21].

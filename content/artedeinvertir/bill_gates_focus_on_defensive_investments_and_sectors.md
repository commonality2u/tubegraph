[[Bill Gates investing strategies | Bill Gates]] has adopted a significantly more conservative stance in his investment portfolio, shifting towards defensive sectors and divesting from many high-risk assets. This strategy is influenced by his concerns about future economic conditions and potential global threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>. His investment movements are closely observed globally due to his high percentage of success in investments and deep knowledge of economic and technological sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

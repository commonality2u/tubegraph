This article examines the recent [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | portfolio]] changes made by renowned investor [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]], focusing on his significant sell-off of shares and the underlying market theory influencing his decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. It also explores the rationale behind the few holdings he has maintained or recently acquired.

## Background of [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]]
[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]] is a famous investor, known for predicting the 2007-2008 subprime mortgage crisis, an event dramatized in the movie "The Big Short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:54">[02:20:54]</a>. He started as a Value Investor, focusing on undervalued small-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:53">[02:40:53]</a>. He grew a small fund of $1 million to $600 million before the subprime crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>. After spending years out of the public eye, he returned to managing his assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:05">[03:03:05]</a>.

Since his [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | portfolio]] became public (required for professional investors with over $100 million in US assets), it has generated annual returns of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>. Early in his career, he extensively shared his [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | investment philosophy]], techniques, and stock valuation methods on forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:00">[03:36:00]</a>.

## Recent [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | Portfolio]] Changes and Warnings
[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]] has been vocal about market dangers, warning about bubbles in areas like technology stocks, renewable energy, and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:15:00">[04:15:00]</a>. His recent public [[Michael Burrys stock movements and market predictions | stock movements]] show a significant reduction in his [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | portfolio]], with most positions being sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. His public [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | portfolio]] value dropped from $150-$300 million in previous quarters to just $41 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

He has liquidated various positions, including:
*   **Tesla (Put Options)**: He undid all his put options against Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:00">[02:17:00]</a>.
*   **Bullish Bets**: Sold bullish bets on companies like Facebook and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
*   **Bearish Bets**: Liquidated bearish bets against the Cathie Wood fund and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.

This move indicates a shift towards liquidity and a cautious stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>. It is speculated that he is even shorting the entire market through derivatives, which are not required to be reported publicly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:00">[02:59:00]</a>.

## Theory of Inelastic Markets
[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]] frequently tweets about his "markets without elastic" theory, which is crucial for understanding current market behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:55:00">[04:55:00]</a>.

This theory suggests that:
*   A dollar of new money invested in the market can increase market value by 3 to 8 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>. This occurs because when the market is rising, sellers are reluctant, leading to higher prices for available shares due to limited supply and high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:00">[05:56:00]</a>.
*   **Passive Investment**: The rise of passive investment (e.g., index funds) accelerates this effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:36:00">[06:36:00]</a>. Index funds are obligated to buy shares to maintain specific weights, regardless of price, forcing prices up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. Unlike traditional funds that rotate out of expensive shares, passive funds are price-agnostic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:00">[01:17:00]</a>.
*   **Share Buybacks**: Aggressive share buybacks by companies also benefit from this effect, reducing available supply and pushing prices up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **Leverage**: New money entering the market is often leveraged (e.g., 1 to 2, 1 to 10), amplifying the multiplier effect. A single new dollar can effectively become $20 of market value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>.
*   **Market Behavior**: This inelasticity leads to more pronounced market movements, both upward and downward. Rapid increases are followed by equally rapid corrections when emotional selling begins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a>. This was observed in 2015, 2018, and March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:00">[01:52:00]</a>.
*   **Accelerated by Information**: Increased access to information makes market reactions faster, requiring investors to act more decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:00">[02:14:00]</a>.

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]] believes that the market's current overvaluation, combined with record capital inflows in the past 1.5 years (more than the previous 19 years combined) and the increasing percentage of passive investing, creates a dangerous environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>.

## Key [[overview_of_michael_burrys_significant_stock_picks | Stock Investments]] in the Reduced [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | Portfolio]]
Despite his cautious stance, [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]] made some interesting purchases or retained positions in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:81:00">[02:81:00]</a>. The few remaining significant positions include Lockheed Martin and CVS Health, along with DistributionNOW.

### Lockheed Martin (LMT)
Lockheed Martin is a defense contractor known for manufacturing sophisticated defense pieces like the F-18, F-22 Raptor, F-35, helicopters, and missile defense systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: The company benefits from manufacturing unique and essential defense technology that few others produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Non-Cyclical Nature**: Unlike consumer goods or cyclical industries, Lockheed Martin's revenue is largely predictable and less affected by general economic cycles, as its primary customers are governments and allies whose defense spending tends to be stable or increase due to geopolitical realities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:00">[03:52:00]</a>.
*   **Recent Performance**: The company recently issued a profit warning, expecting a slight revenue decrease in 2022 and low single-digit growth in subsequent years, which led to a stock decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. However, it plans to use its strong balance sheet for share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:00">[03:46:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Lockheed Martin is currently trading at a historically low valuation range of 12-13 times earnings, compared to its historical average of 16-18 times and peak of 22 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:00">[05:59:00]</a>. This suggests it might be undervalued given its stable business model and essential products.

### CVS Health (CVS)
CVS Health is a large healthcare company with diverse business lines, including health plans and insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:12">[01:04:12]</a>.
*   **Defensive Business**: The healthcare sector, especially private insurance in the US, is very lucrative and predictable, as people continue to pay for medical expenses and insurance regardless of economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:24">[01:04:24]</a>.
*   **Financial Health**: CVS Health has historically been a good business with high returns on investment, strong cash flow generation, and the ability to buy back shares, contributing to its positive stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:50">[01:04:50]</a>.
*   **Growth and Valuation**: The company recently increased its profit outlook for 2021 to almost $8 per share and is trading at 11-12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>. Its profits have consistently grown year-over-year, even during challenging periods like 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:01">[01:06:01]</a>. Its valuation is considered a medium range historically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:31">[01:11:31]</a>.

### DistributionNOW (DNOW)
DistributionNOW is a distributor of components and consumables for the oil and gas sector, including valves, storage tanks, and gas compression stations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:29">[01:17:29]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: It acts as an intermediary, connecting numerous suppliers with numerous clients (oil companies, pipelines), which makes the intermediation model efficient and valuable in a fragmented industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>. This model, often benefiting from a "network effect," requires little capital investment and generates high cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:11">[01:21:11]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality**: The main challenge for DistributionNOW is its ties to the cyclical oil and gas sector. When oil prices are high, investment and demand for components increase, but a collapse in oil prices leads to decreased orders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:11">[01:22:11]</a>.
*   **Recent Performance**: The company lost money in 2020 when oil prices were low but rebounded to profitability in Q3 as oil prices recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:27">[01:23:27]</a>.
*   **Investment Rationale**: [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]]'s interest might be linked to his inflationary outlook, where higher oil prices would necessitate increased capital expenditures in the sector, benefiting DistributionNOW <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:16">[01:24:16]</a>. When oil was at $100, the company earned around $100 million, making its current valuation (around $600 million enterprise value) appear cheap at 6 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:37">[01:24:37]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies and advice from Michael Burry | Investment Strategies and Advice]]
[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]]'s [[Michael Burrys investment style and achievements | investment style]] emphasizes understanding the intrinsic value of a business and how it evolves, rather than focusing solely on current stock prices or market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a>.

Key tenets of his approach include:
*   **Understanding the Business**: It's crucial to understand a business's core operations, its competitive advantages, and its ability to generate future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>.
*   **Intrinsic Value**: This is a subjective opinion, not a fixed target, but it serves as a guide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:24">[01:42:24]</a>. Investors should aim to buy a business below its estimated intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Focus**: The stock market is not a straight line; volatility creates opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:35:10">[01:35:10]</a>. Time is the friend of good businesses and the enemy of bad ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:24">[01:30:24]</a>.
*   **Psychological Biases**: Investors must control emotions, avoid herd mentality, and not be swayed by short-term market euphoria or panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Continuous Learning**: [[Investment strategies and advice from Michael Burry | Professional investment tools]] involve continuous learning, questioning assumptions, and refining one's method <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:17">[01:52:17]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: Studying historical market behavior and how companies perform in different economic scenarios provides valuable insights for evaluating businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:52">[01:43:52]</a>.

[[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Burry]]'s recent actions reflect a belief that the market is in a dangerous, overvalued state, prompting him to largely exit positions and maintain a highly liquid or short-biased [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | portfolio]], while selectively investing in fundamentally strong, defensive businesses that may offer value despite the overall market environment.

## Introduction to Investment Strategy
This article delves into current [[Investment Strategies and Portfolio Management | investment strategies and portfolio management]], examining the recent adjustments made by prominent investors like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett in response to evolving economic scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. It also provides insights into how to approach [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | managing investment portfolios]] effectively, particularly during periods of market volatility.

## Ray Dalio's Defensive Shift
Ray Dalio, renowned as the manager of the world's largest [[Investment Funds and Asset Management | investment fund]], has issued a significant warning about the future, predicting a major shift in the global economic landscape <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His recently published portfolio reveals a strategic move towards a more defensive stance, involving the sale of a large portion of his shares and a reduction in exposure to nearly 300 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

### Market Outlook and Portfolio Adjustments
Dalio's warnings stem from several factors, including:
*   **Political Polarization in the U.S.:** A "tremendous political polarization" between Republicans and Democrats, even hinting at a risk of civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Shift in Global Power:** The rotation of world power from the United States to China, potentially leading to future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **End of Easy Money:** Central banks, including the Fed, are abandoning "easy money" policies (low interest rates, money printing), which Dalio believes will have serious market consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Market "Madness":** Concerns about the speculative "madness" in the crypto world and certain technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.

Investors, according to Dalio, must adapt to an environment where central banks will no longer provide free money, coupled with periods of high inflation and more challenging financial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. A Fed member, Mr. Vilar, suggested interest rates in the U.S. could reach 1% by July, implying four rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>. This has contributed to recent market volatility and significant drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Dalio also predicts significantly lower future returns for markets and investments, potentially falling from 8-10% to as low as 3-4%, accompanied by a much higher level of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. He specifically warns that the world could change "in a quite alarming way" in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Ray Dalio's right-hand man, Mr. James, suggests the Fed will not intervene ("Fed's put") until the S&P 500 sees drops of 15-20%, viewing such corrections as healthy to adjust overvaluation, especially in technology sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

### Dalio's Portfolio Changes
Dalio has sold almost all shares from emerging countries and reduced weight in around 300 others, considering them risky assets that correct more in volatile markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. His purchases, though smaller in percentage, have been in defensive stocks like Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which are expected to perform better during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. This demonstrates his clear defensive positioning based on actions, not just words <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

## Impact on Valuations and Investment Philosophy

### Tech Stock Corrections
Many popular technology companies that previously experienced significant overvaluation have seen severe falls of 50% to 80% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>. This correction is attributed to the "new dose of reality" from the Fed and central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. Examples include Sofi (-61%) and Block (-60%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Mark Leonard's Approach to Tech Valuations
Mark Leonard, CEO of Constellation Software, a highly successful tech holding company, offers valuable advice for [[Investment Strategies and Portfolio Management | investing]] in technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. He advocates a value-oriented approach similar to Warren Buffett's, applied to the tech sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. Leonard states that good tech businesses should "never trade above five times their sales," and considers multiples below two times sales as a "good deal" for quality companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. Many currently popular tech stocks, despite significant drops, still trade above these recommended multiples, indicating remaining overvaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.

> [!tip] Mark Leonard's Valuation Rule <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>
> "Good businesses in the technology sector should never trade above five times their sales... Multiples below 2 times, if the company is good, is recurrent, has some growth, etc., it is a good deal or a good investment."

### Importance of Independent Thinking
The speaker emphasizes the critical need for [[psychology_of_investing | independent thinking]] in [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>. Investors should always verify information, analyze investment theses, and understand how to monitor their investments, taking personal responsibility for outcomes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

## Notable Investor Moves

### Michael Burry's Defensive Plays
Michael Burry, known for "The Big Short," has bought several interesting shares:
*   **General Dynamics:** A defense sector company manufacturing military equipment like nuclear submarines, which has high competitive advantages and non-cyclical demand. Burry sees it as a defensive stock that typically performs well when the broader market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:21">[00:25:21]</a>. The stock has historically been undervalued, trading around 7 times earnings at times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:20">[00:27:20]</a>.
*   **Fidelity National Financial:** The leading company in the U.S. mortgage title insurance niche. This is a very lucrative business with few competitors. Burry likely sees value in its historically low valuation (8 times earnings) at a time when home sales are recovering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.

### Bill Miller's Portfolio Additions
Bill Miller, a legendary investor known for beating the S&P 500 for nearly 20 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:47">[00:30:47]</a>, has added positions in XC Technology. This company, while suffering on the stock market due to deteriorating business and high initial valuation, now trades at a much lower multiple (8 times earnings), offering potential for recovery if it can stabilize or slightly grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:09">[00:32:09]</a>.

### Concentrated Portfolio's Focus
A highly effective, lesser-known fund maintains a hyper-concentrated portfolio of only eight stocks, all recognized as "exceptionally good businesses" with huge competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:17">[00:34:17]</a>. These include Google, Microsoft, Visa, Facebook, and Mastercard. The fund has recently increased its positions in Visa and Mastercard, viewing their recent falls as temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:10">[00:35:10]</a>. Mastercard, for example, reported spectacular results, with profits up over 40% and strong future growth guidance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>.

## True Value Fund's Investment Philosophy
The True Value fund adheres to a philosophy of [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio | investing]] in stocks with a clear intrinsic value, aiming to buy them below that value and ensuring that value is expected to increase in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. The fund actively increases its positions during market downturns, viewing discounts as good investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:42">[00:40:42]</a>.

### Case Studies from True Value Portfolio
*   **Humana (UMAN):** This company recently published strong results, exceeding market expectations, and increased its profit outlook for the future. The company itself is actively repurchasing shares, indicating their belief that the stock is trading below its intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
*   **MT Group:** A defensive business in the restaurant sector, which has been impacted by pandemic restrictions but is now showing signs of recovery, particularly as Canada lifts restrictions. It is trading at a reasonable valuation (around 9-10 times earnings) and has good growth prospects as the acquisition environment normalizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:08">[00:50:08]</a>.
*   **Facebook (Meta):** Despite recent profit warnings and a significant drop, Facebook is trading at historically low valuation levels (around 13-14 times future profits, excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. The online advertising industry is still expected to grow, but the market currently focuses on negative aspects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:48">[00:58:48]</a>.
*   **Nordic Real Estate (Entra):** This company, a "Nordic king" in real estate, is highly valued due to the strength of the Nordic economies. Despite a recent drop due to fears of rising interest rates, the company's strong profits and ability to benefit from inflation (as rising rates indicate inflation) make it an attractive long-term investment. Its valuation is currently around its book value, while historically it should be much higher given its return on equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:45">[01:13:45]</a>.
*   **PayPal:** Despite recent profit warnings and drops, PayPal is now trading at around 20 times earnings for a company still growing at 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:40">[01:31:40]</a>. Large volume spikes during panic selling can indicate a short-term market bottom, offering an opportunity for private investors to optimize entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.

## Conclusion: The Importance of Education and Patience
The current market environment, characterized by volatility and fear, is an "ideal time" for investors to train and develop their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>. Learning to identify exceptional investments, understanding how to value companies, and developing [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | portfolio management]] concepts are crucial for long-term wealth generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>. Successful investors capitalize on market fear and short-termism, buying when others panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>.

> [!quote] The Market's Wisdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>
> "They take advantage of the fact that people are afraid, panicking, they pocket it, that people are tremendously short-term... that's why you make money in the stock market because volatility, in fact, if these falls that have occurred recently don't excite you, you're not prepared to invest in the stock market."

Investors are encouraged to adopt a long-term perspective, focusing on a company's fundamentals and intrinsic value rather than short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:55">[01:03:55]</a>.

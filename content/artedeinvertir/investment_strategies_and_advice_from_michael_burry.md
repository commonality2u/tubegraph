[[Michael Burrys investment style and achievements | Michael Burry]] is renowned as one of the best investors, notably for his accurate prediction of the [[Michael Burry and the 2008 financial crisis | 2008 financial crisis]], which allowed him to amass a significant personal fortune <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His story gained widespread recognition through the film "The Big Short" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>, produced by Brad Pitt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, which was nominated for five Oscars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. After years out of the public eye, Burry warned of a potential new crisis in an interview with the *O Barnes* newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Professional Journey
Surprisingly, [[Michael Burrys investment style and achievements | Michael Burry]] is a doctor by profession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. In the late 1990s, he began to combine his medical work with his passion for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:52">[00:00:52]</a>, actively sharing his investment ideas and results on various internet forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. His early success led some investors to offer him a million dollars to establish his own investment fund, leading to the creation of Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

During its first five years, Scion Capital primarily invested in stocks, achieving impressive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. For instance, in its inaugural year, the fund generated an 8% return while the S&P 500 fell 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The second year saw a 55% return, with the S&P 500 declining by 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. By 2002, it achieved a 16% return while the S&P 500 dropped by 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. These exceptional results attracted significant capital, with Burry managing over $500 million for clients within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

In 2006, as depicted in "The Big Short," Burry's [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | investment style]] underwent a radical shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. He moved from buying stocks to betting his entire fund against the impending 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Although initially challenging due to the bet not paying off immediately, the crisis became evident by 2007-2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. This bold move yielded enormous profits, including a 160% return in 2007 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. Scion Capital generated over $700 million in profits for its investors and an accumulated return of 700% annually, making it one of the most successful funds of its time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. Burry's personal fortune quickly rose to over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. His story of an ordinary person succeeding in finance through sheer effort and dedication has inspired many <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | Michael Burry's Current Investment Portfolio]] (Scion Asset Management)
[[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | Michael Burry's current investment portfolio]] is highly concentrated, consisting of just six stocks, with a net worth of approximately $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>. This portfolio reflects his recent strategic positioning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

### Key Holdings:
*   **GameStop (28% weighting)**: GameStop is the leading retailer of video games and entertainment products in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Despite a significant share price drop (from $45 to $5) due to a shift towards online sales, Burry is an active shareholder, proposing management changes to benefit shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>. This is considered a risky but daring investment, typical of Burry's style, with potential for significant long-term performance if online sales issues are resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>.
*   **Tailored Brands (22% weighting)**: This company sells men's fashion and accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. After strong growth in the 2000s, it has stagnated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. Burry's investment here again shows his preference for the retail sector and shares trading at historical lows, currently with an attractive P/E ratio of five times next year's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
*   **Google (16% weighting)**: Google represents a different type of investment in Burry's portfolio: a high-quality company at historically good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. He likes to mix "contrarian" stocks (ignored, distressed) with high-quality companies that are trading at reasonable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Google falls into this latter category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.
*   **Forman Warehouse (14% weighting)**: This is another retail company selling outdoor sports items like climbing, camping, hunting, and firearms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. The company shows solid growth driven by the outdoor sports market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Burry reportedly invested around $4 per share, and despite the stock rising to $8, he maintains the position due to its attractive valuation of only 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.
*   **Bed Bath & Beyond (13% weighting)**: This company sells household items and is another retail investment in a currently out-of-fashion, beaten-down sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. Despite risks, such as competition from Amazon and online sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>, it appeals to Burry's style due to its attractive valuation of seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Canadian Natural Resources (8% weighting)**: This is Canada's largest oil producer, with a production of one million barrels per day and a market capitalization over $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. It is a pioneer in oil sands technology, an innovative process to extract oil from sand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. The company has seen its stock rise from $4 to $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. It is considered one of the most solid companies in raw materials, having increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years, yielding 4% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. Despite negativity surrounding the energy sector, the market offers these shares at a very attractive valuation of only seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and portfolio changes | Michael Burry's Investment Strategy]] Principles
Based on his extensive activity in early investment forums and blogs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>, [[Michael Burrys investment strategy | Michael Burry]] offers three core pieces of advice that encapsulate his successful [[Michael Burrys investment style and achievements | investment style]]:

### 1. Contrarian Investing
Burry's primary strategy is to buy shares in ignored companies that appear to be on the verge of bankruptcy and then sell them once they show slight improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. He emphasizes that portfolio management is as crucial as company selection for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. This approach explains his strong focus on the retail and energy sectors, which are currently out of favor and abound with undervalued companies that could see significant regularization if fears subside or conditions improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### 2. Concentrated Portfolio
Burry prefers to hold between 12 and 18 stocks in his portfolio, specifically in "depressed industries" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This concentration allows him to capitalize on his best ideas while smoothing out volatility, avoiding confusion between portfolio volatility and risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Anything under 25 stocks is typically considered a concentrated portfolio, a style shared by other great investors like Warren Buffett and Peter Lynch, who favor investing heavily in high-conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Quality Companies
In addition to his contrarian bets, Burry is open to adding companies favored by Warren Buffett to his portfolio: those with a competitive advantage and high return on capital, provided they are offered at good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. His investment in Google exemplifies this principle, as it is a classic high-quality company with a competitive advantage trading at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:19">[00:11:19]</a>. This highlights Burry's flexibility; he can quickly enter both contrarian ideas and more popular companies as long as he identifies them as being reasonably priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:28">[00:11:28]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:32">[00:11:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

In essence, [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and portfolio changes | Michael Burry's strategy]] combines deep value investing in overlooked sectors with a disciplined, concentrated approach, always willing to embrace quality growth when available at fair prices.

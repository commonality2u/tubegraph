According to a recent live stream, [[Michael Burrys market predictions | Michael Burry]], a professional fund manager known for his past predictions and strong track record, has offered a detailed roadmap regarding when he believes the current economic crisis might end and how it could evolve in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. He has rarely been so clear and explicit in his outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>.

## Historical Warnings
[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] stated that the last time he warned, referring to the 2008 crisis, people claimed he didn't warn, but he did, only nobody was listening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. He noted that he predicted the 2008 crisis as early as 2005-2006 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Similarly, in early 2021, he warned about factors like inflation causing stock market problems, which eventually materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>. He is now issuing another important warning, which he feels is going unnoticed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.

## The Bullwhip Effect and Deflation
[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] highlighted a tweet he posted regarding "excess inventories in the retail sector" and the "bullwhip effect" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. He stressed the importance of understanding this concept for investment efforts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. He linked this to a CNN news report indicating that major retail chains like Walmart and Target were asking customers not to return purchased items due to massive inventory excess <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

The "bullwhip effect" explains that during periods of supply problems, like recent economic conditions where consumers over-purchase due to shortages, retailers, distributors, and manufacturers all over-order to compensate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. For example, if 10 units are expected to be sold, a merchant might order 15, a distributor 20, and a manufacturer 40, leading to a significant oversupply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>. This oversupply, according to [[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]], will lead to disinflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

### Disinflation and Fed Policy
[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] predicts a period of disinflation, a deceleration in the rate of price increases, which is currently unexpected by many who anticipate continued inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. He suggests this disinflation will occur in the latter part of the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>.

This predicted disinflation, driven by excess inventories and a looming recession, will compel the Federal Reserve (Fed) to reverse its aggressive policy of raising rates and quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. He anticipates the Fed will halt rate hikes or even lower them, and end quantitative tightening, which involves withdrawing money from the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This change in policy, he believes, will be bullish for stocks, investments, and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

## Recession and Market Sentiment
[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] mentioned that a recession is practically evident, with final data for the second quarter still pending but expected to show contraction, officially marking the beginning of a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. The Atlanta Federal Reserve's tracker predicts a 2% contraction for the second quarter, following a minus 1.4% in the first quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

Market sentiment reflects extreme negativity, with searches for "recession" on Google reaching historic highs, even surpassing levels seen in March 2020 or 2008-2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Historically, such peaks in public interest often coincide with the easing of problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>. Positioning of asset managers in futures is at an all-time low (2%), even lower than in March 2020, suggesting widespread risk aversion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:38">[00:29:38]</a>.

## The Roadmap for the Next Six Months
[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] proposes a roadmap that suggests the "theater" (speculation and high asset prices) that took over a decade to fill won't empty in less than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>. While many speculative stocks and assets have seen significant drops (70-90%), a lot of speculation remains across various markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:06">[00:16:06]</a>.

He compares the current period to 1968-1982, which were "14 lost years" for the stock market, characterized by extreme volatility with both selling and buying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:42">[00:16:42]</a>. He explains that history repeats itself, noting parallels to 1969-1970, which saw a market fall of almost 30% (similar to the current 22-25% drop) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:31">[00:17:31]</a>. In that period, inflation alleviated, leading to a strong market rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:08">[00:19:08]</a>.

[[Michael Burrys market predictions | Burry]] predicts that the central banks will pause or lower rates due to fears of inflation stopping and a recession, causing an initial market rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:31">[00:19:31]</a>. However, he cautions that after the "bullwhip effect" passes, inflation could return with more virulence if money withdrawal from the system isn't continued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.

His prediction suggests a period of calm and buying opportunities in the next three to six months due to strong disinflation forcing central banks to change policy, which would be bullish for the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:18">[00:22:18]</a>. However, he warns that this doesn't mean the long-term problems are over, and in 1-3 years, inflation could potentially accelerate further if policies are not managed correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:39">[00:21:39]</a>. This implies a potentially tricky period after the initial rebound.

The current economic landscape is characterized by significant shifts, leading to increased [[stock_market_volatility_and_the_impact_of_global_events | stock market volatility]] and affecting [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | stock valuations]]. Influential investors like Ray Dalio and Michael Burry are adjusting their portfolios defensively in anticipation of a challenging future economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Warnings and Portfolio Adjustments

Ray Dalio, renowned as the manager of the world's largest investment fund, is closely watched for his market insights, especially given his accurate prediction of the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. He has successfully navigated numerous market crises over the past two to three decades with minimal losses, making his statements highly influential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### The "New World Order" and Economic Shifts
Dalio has warned of a "new world order" marked by:
*   **Political Polarization**: Tremendous political polarization within the United States, even mentioning a risk of civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.
*   **Shifting Global Power**: A rotation of world power from the United States to China, potentially causing future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **Dollar's Role**: The possibility of the U.S. dollar ceasing to be the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.

Coupled with this, Dalio anticipates a significant policy change from central banks, moving away from "easy money," low interest rates, and excessive money printing, which he believes will have serious market consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>. He also pointed out the "madness" observed in the crypto world and certain technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. Investors, he states, must prepare for periods of high inflation and much more difficult financial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

In a recent interview (February 10th), Dalio predicted that future market returns will be significantly lower than in the past (potentially 3-4% compared to 8-10%) and accompanied by much higher risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He specifically warned that the world could change in an alarming way in the next five years due to these financial, geopolitical, and internal U.S. struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

### Defensive Portfolio Adjustments
Ray Dalio's recent portfolio publication reveals a defensive shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. He sold approximately 90% of his shares and reduced weight in nearly 300 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>. Notably, he sold almost all emerging market and technology ETFs, considering them risky assets that tend to correct more during [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. His purchases were primarily in defensive stocks, such as Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which are expected to perform better during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Federal Reserve Actions and Market Response
An emergency Fed meeting and subsequent statements by Fed members, such as Mr. Waller, suggest that interest rates could reach 1% in the U.S. by July, implying four rate hikes from the current zero rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. This unexpected acceleration of rate hikes, driven by higher-than-expected inflation (the highest in 40 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>, has led to a reappearance of [[market_volatility_and_how_to_navigate_it | volatility]] and significant market drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

Ray Dalio's right-hand man, Mr. James, explained that the Federal Reserve's "Fed put" (market intervention) will likely not occur until the S&P 500 experiences falls of 15-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The Fed views such corrections as healthy for adjusting to the new reality and correcting [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | overvaluation]], particularly in certain market sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. While the S&P 500 has only dropped 9% from its maximum, the Nasdaq and small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 have corrected by around 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:43">[00:06:43]</a>.

## Valuation and Investment Strategies Amidst Volatility
The new economic scenario highlights the enormous risk of holding "expensive shares" that are trading at very high multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:31">[00:10:31]</a>. Recent disappointing earnings reports from many technology companies have led to drops of 20-30% in just a few days, even after significant accumulated declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>. This indicates a structural change in the market over the past month and a half <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### Mark Leonard's Valuation Philosophy
Mark Leonard, CEO of Constellation Software, a highly successful technology holding company, offers practical advice on [[the_importance_of_understanding_stock_valuation | stock valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:47">[00:11:47]</a>. He, an admirer of Warren Buffett, has built a robust company that has multiplied its value by 100 times in 15 years and has remained stable during crises, unlike many other tech stocks that have fallen 50-60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Leonard's key insights for the technology sector include:
*   Good businesses should **never trade above five times their sales** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>. This implies profit multiples above 30-40 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>.
*   He considers multiples **below two times sales** a good investment for good companies with recurring revenue and some growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

Many popular tech stocks, even after plummeting over 60-70% from their highs, still trade above Leonard's recommended five times sales threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Examples include Traders (23x sales) and Snowflake (46x sales), highlighting the significant [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | overvaluation]] that previously existed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:01">[00:15:01]</a>.

## Insights from Other Investors

### Michael Burry's Defensive Plays
Michael Burry, known for "The Big Short," has recently bought several defensive shares:
*   **Bristol Myers**: A biotechnology company trading at 10 times earnings, below the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics**: A defense contractor manufacturing military equipment like nuclear submarines, with virtually no competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. Its products offer significant military supremacy, and demand is non-cyclical, depending on defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:59">[00:25:59]</a>. This stock is considered defensive as defense budgets are less affected by economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:24">[00:27:24]</a>. It trades at its historical average (around 15x earnings when Burry bought it) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Fidelity National Financial**: A leader in mortgage title insurance in the U.S., a lucrative niche where practically all home buyers purchase this insurance to cover potential hidden debts or building issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>. The company benefits from recovering home sales and its valuation is at historic lows (8x earnings compared to a 10-year average of 14-15x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

### Bill Miller's Notable Moves
Bill Miller, a legendary investor known for consistently beating the S&P 500 for nearly 20 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>, has recently added positions in **XC Technology** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:10">[00:32:10]</a>. This IT services company suffered significantly due to outdated engineers and a high starting [[the_importance_of_understanding_stock_valuation | valuation]] that deteriorated with the business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. Now, with a more reasonable valuation (8x earnings compared to rivals at 18x), Miller likely sees potential for recovery if the business stabilizes or grows modestly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>.

### Hyper-Concentrated Fund's Strategy
A lesser-known but highly successful fund manages a hyper-concentrated portfolio of only eight stocks, all considered exceptionally good businesses with significant competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. These include Google, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, and Moody's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>. The fund often capitalizes on market fears to buy good businesses at discounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:17">[00:35:17]</a>.

**Mastercard** is a prime example: despite recent fears related to alliances with Amazon and "buy now, pay later" trends, Mastercard published spectacular results, with profits growing over 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a>. Its cross-border business (international payments) is still recovering from pre-pandemic levels, suggesting further future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:14">[00:36:14]</a>. The company projects 15-19% profit growth over the next three to four years, with earnings per share expected to grow 20-23% annually due to expanding operating margins and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:40">[00:36:40]</a>. While previously trading at 45x earnings (high), recent drops have brought its valuation to around 31x earnings, aligning with its historical average during periods of more normalized interest rates (e.g., 2018) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:34">[00:37:34]</a>.

## True Value Fund's Approach to Volatility
The True Value fund adheres to a philosophy of investing in stocks with a clear intrinsic value, aiming to buy them below that value and expecting that value to increase over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>.

### Examples of Portfolio Companies:
*   **Uman**: Published strong results, exceeding expectations, and continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>.
*   **Google (Alphabet)**: Despite good results, the stock price has fallen, a typical behavior in a bear market where positive news might not lead to price increases or even result in declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:56">[00:45:56]</a>. The company has increased its profit expectations and introduced a new 20% growth guidance for 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:38">[00:46:38]</a>. Google's shares are trading at 7-8 times future earnings based on this guidance, significantly below its historical average of 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.
*   **MT Group**: A defensive business with good growth prospects, trading at a reasonable valuation of 9-10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. Despite the challenges faced by the restaurant sector during the pandemic, MT Group is recovering its EBITDA to 2019 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:52">[00:50:52]</a>.
*   **SBB (Samhällsbyggnadsbolaget i Norden AB)**: A Nordic real estate company that has issued bonds with negative interest rates, reflecting the strength and safety of the Nordic real estate sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. Despite strong profit growth, SBB's shares have fallen due to concerns about rising interest rates affecting real estate valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:37">[01:16:37]</a>. However, the speaker argues that inflation (which often accompanies rising rates) benefits the real estate sector, as properties revalue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:08">[01:18:08]</a>. SBB is valued by its book value, and currently trades at around 1x book value, which is considered low given its historical role and growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:51">[01:25:51]</a>.

### Negative Real Rates and Market Implications
The speaker discusses the potential for a "negative real rates" environment, where prevailing interest rates are lower than inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:38">[01:22:38]</a>. This scenario can occur if central banks cannot raise rates too much without collapsing consumer economies (due to high mortgage burdens) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:00">[01:23:00]</a>. In such an environment, financial investments (like stocks) and real estate investments tend to perform exceptionally well, as investors seek to protect their capital from inflation, even potentially leading to market rallies and bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:10">[01:24:10]</a>.

## Psychology and Learning in Volatile Markets
Market volatility, characterized by fear and panic, creates opportunities for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. The speaker encourages investors to welcome these downturns as times to acquire assets at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:49">[01:00:49]</a>. He compares it to pulling a bad tooth: painful in the short term, but beneficial for long-term health and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:10">[01:01:10]</a>.

### The Importance of Training and Independent Thinking
The current environment is described as ideal for investor training, as it allows individuals to learn how to identify undervalued assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:15">[01:42:15]</a>. Students who trained during the March 2020 crisis, for instance, achieved exceptional returns by applying their knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:34">[01:42:34]</a>.

Key takeaways for effective investing in volatile markets include:
*   **Independent Thinking**: Investors should always check information and form their own opinions, rather than blindly following others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **Understanding Business Fundamentals**: It's crucial to understand a company's business and its long-term earnings potential, not just short-term price movements or external perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>.
*   **Optimizing Entry Points**: Observing trading volumes can help identify potential "valleys" in stock prices after large drops, allowing private investors to optimize their entry points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:05">[01:32:05]</a>.
*   **Avoiding "Market Tourism"**: Successful investors distinguish themselves from "market tourists" by making informed decisions based on fundamental understanding, not just reacting to price changes or media narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:51]</a>.

The speaker emphasizes that wealth generation in the long term stems from taking advantage of market fears and short-termism, consistently earning good rates of return over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.

Warren Buffett, widely regarded as the greatest investor of all time, has achieved tremendous success in the world of investments, turning an early $1,000 investment into over $34 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. He revealed seven basic principles during a university lecture that he uses to achieve this success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article explains these principles, especially for those just starting to invest or with limited capital, illustrating them with real-world stock examples recommended by Buffett for beginners <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Principle 1: Invest in Good Companies and Avoid Mediocre Businesses

Buffett's primary advice for beginners is to invest in good companies and avoid mediocre businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He states that it's generally a bad idea to invest in low-quality businesses, even if they appear cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>. While such stocks might offer quick gains of 30-40%, they don't generate long-term value, preventing investors from benefiting from the [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies | compound capitalization effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

Investing in exceptional businesses that generate substantial long-term value offers two major advantages:
1.  **Single Analysis, Long-Term Returns**: Investors do the analytical work only once and can theoretically benefit from returns for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Compound Capitalization Effect**: Exceptional shares can multiply by 8, 10, 20, or even 50 times in the stock market due to the [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies | compound capitalization effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Examples of Mediocre vs. Exceptional Businesses

*   **Mediocre Example: General Motors (GM)**
    General Motors is cited as a bad stock that has not generated value and constantly struggles in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Its price has shown little movement over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. While a novice investor might be tempted to buy it during negative periods for short-term gains (30-40% rises), it's not a stock that will multiply multiple times in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Filling a portfolio with such situations often leads to mediocre long-term performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

*   **Exceptional Example: Moody's (MCO)**
    In contrast, Moody's, a debt rating agency, is an example of an exceptional business that generates significant long-term value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Over the last 10 years, Moody's has multiplied its value by more than 10 times on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>, and it is likely to continue giving good returns in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

### Identifying Good Businesses

To identify good businesses, Buffett suggests two main methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>:
1.  **Study Company Fundamentals**: Understand the company's operations, profit and loss account, and balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. Focus on consistent growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>.
2.  **Observe Stock Market Performance (Accessible for Beginners)**: If a company's stock has not multiplied several times in the last 10 or 20 years, it's probably not a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. After identifying good performance, one must also assess the company's valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Principle 2: Understand Companies Before Investing

Warren Buffett emphasizes the importance of understanding companies before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. This means having certainty that the company will generate profits in ten years, and those profits will be greater than current production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. A key secret to his success is avoiding investments in very new or rapidly changing sectors because he cannot analyze their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Examples of Understandable vs. Unpredictable Businesses

*   **Understandable Example: McDonald's (MCD)**
    McDonald's is a favorite investment of Buffett's because it's easy to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. Technological changes like the internet won't stop people from eating hamburgers or drinking Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:34">[00:04:34]</a>. The company's revenue model is clear, it has few risks that could end it, and its long-term profit growth is predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. This predictability has led to its stock multiplying by more than three times in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. This aligns with the concept of [[predictable_businesses_in_investment | predictable businesses]].

*   **Unpredictable Example: Intel (INTC)**
    The semiconductor sector, exemplified by Intel, is much more volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Buffett has never invested in Intel until recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. The rapid shifts in competition (e.g., NVIDIA or Jaime De Bruyne's success) have made Intel's profit and revenue outlook much more complicated, leading to poor stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>.

## Principle 3: Act Decisively on Opportunities

When a good investment opportunity is found and understood, Buffett advises not to be afraid to take a high position in your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>. This decisiveness has been a key factor in his long-term success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

*   **Apple (AAPL)**: Buffett's current portfolio shows high conviction in Apple shares, representing 47% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. When he saw the opportunity in 2016, he invested over $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. Since then, Apple's shares have multiplied by more than six times, yielding profits close to $100 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Historical Pattern**: Historically, Buffett's top five positions have consistently represented over 50% of his total portfolio, demonstrating high conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola (KO)**: When Buffett identified Coca-Cola as a good opportunity, he invested decisively, and the shares have since multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.
*   **American Express (AXP)**: Early in his career, he allocated 20% of his portfolio to American Express, which has since multiplied by over 200 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Buffett also advises not to feel bad for missing opportunities you don't understand, but to regret missing those you *were* capable of analyzing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. For example, he doesn't regret not investing in Bitcoin as he couldn't analyze it, but he regrets missing Netflix, whose business he could have understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

## Principle 4: Do Not Sell Unless the Business Fundamentally Changes

Extraordinary stocks that multiply over the long term often experience periods of significant drops (30% or even 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. During these moments of panic, Buffett recommends ignoring market price fluctuations and focusing on whether the company's ability to generate profits or its competitive position has fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. If nothing has changed, the best action is to either do nothing or increase your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.

*   **Tesla (TSLA)**: Tesla shares, one of the best performers in the last decade, have multiplied by over 90 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. However, they experienced eight market corrections with falls of over 30% during the last 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. A novice investor who panicked and sold during these drops would have missed out on long-term returns, as the underlying business had not changed as much as the stock market suggested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
*   **Selling When Changes Occur**: Conversely, Buffett advises selling shares without hesitation when new risks emerge or the business fundamentally changes, even if the shares haven't fallen in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. He did this recently with IBM shares, selling them entirely despite their lateral stock market behavior, because the business had changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

### Example of a Stable Business: Stryker (SYK)

Stryker, a leading medical equipment manufacturer, operates in a stable sector with tailwinds due to population aging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Its profits are estimated to be increasing and stable in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. Despite its strong long-term rise, Stryker shares experienced ten occasions where they fell more than 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. Currently, Stryker trades at a reasonable valuation, and its future prospects remain strong, with estimated annual profit growth of at least 10% for the next 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. This implies a future valuation of over $400, compared to its current $240 price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>.

## Principle 5: Invest Using Facts, Not Emotions

This is considered one of the best tips, as emotions often cause investors to lose in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>. Buffett noted that investors get excited during bull markets, buying more of the stocks that are already rising, but ignoring those that haven't gone up, which creates "giant opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

*   **Disney (DIS)**: For five years, Disney's stock performed sideways while the rest of the market surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. However, in recent months, it has more than doubled, despite being the same business with the same assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This exemplifies the tremendous opportunities that arise when investors react emotionally to sideways movements rather than fundamental value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.

## Principle 6: Invest in Companies with Talented and Integral Managers

It's crucial to remember that behind every share is a business run by people whose talent and integrity play a fundamental role in the business's future and stock market evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

*   **Amazon (AMZN)**: Buffett's recent investment in Amazon is an example <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, has enormous business talent and has consistently treated shareholders with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>.
*   **Aligned Interests**: Buffett also recommends investing in companies where management owns many shares of the company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This ensures their interests are aligned with other shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>. Ideally, the value of the shares they own should be ten times higher than their salary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. This alignment makes a positive long-term evolution of the company very likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Principle 7: Always Buy Shares Below Their Intrinsic Value

Perhaps the most important piece of advice is to always buy shares below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. Intrinsic value is a subjective value calculated by the investor through a process of stock valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. This involves making a conservative estimate of future benefits and applying valuation methods to arrive at the intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>.

*   **Coca-Cola (KO) Example**: Using Coca-Cola shares as an example, the blue line represents the intrinsic value, and the red line is the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. When the market price was above the intrinsic value (e.g., 2003-2004), it was not a good time to invest, and shares subsequently went down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>. Conversely, when the price was below the intrinsic value (e.g., 2009 or 2012), the subsequent stock market performance was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>. This highlights the importance of [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | undervalued stocks]].

Valuing shares is a simple process that requires learning, and resources are available to help investors master it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

By adhering to these seven principles, investors can learn from Warren Buffett's success and navigate the stock market more effectively, focusing on exceptional businesses and long-term value creation.

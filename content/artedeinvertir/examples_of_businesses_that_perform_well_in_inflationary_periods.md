Inflation, currently hovering around 4-5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, has become a significant concern for investors. Influential figures such as [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategies_during_inflation | Warren Buffett]], Charlie Munger, and Ray Dalio have warned that this inflationary period could be more prolonged than initially anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. They suggest that inflation acts as an "additional tax" on investments, diminishing the value of liquid assets and fixed-term deposits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

The speaker highlights [[investment_strategies_during_inflation | Warren Buffett's investment strategies during inflation]], emphasizing his "toll bridge" metaphor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. This concept suggests investing in businesses that have already made the bulk of their capital [[investment opportunities in inflationary environments | investment]] with "old dollars" and do not require continuous significant reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. These "toll bridge" companies are also characterized by predictable consumer demand, allowing them to raise prices in line with or above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

## Key Characteristics of "Toll Bridge" Businesses

Companies that fit the "toll bridge" profile generally possess the following traits:
*   **Low Capital Expenditure (Capex)**: They do not need to invest heavily to maintain or grow their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power**: Ability to pass on increased costs to consumers without losing demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
*   **Recurring Revenue**: Predictable income streams from essential goods or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   **Strong Brand or Market Position**: Established brand or oligopoly position, reducing the need for new brand building or heavy advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.
*   **Fixed-Rate Debt**: Ideally, debt is at a fixed rate, so rising interest rates do not increase servicing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:28">[00:41:28]</a>.

## Examples of Businesses Performing Well in Inflationary Periods

Here are five examples of companies that align with [[investment_opportunities_in_inflationary_environments | Warren Buffett's investment philosophy during inflation]]:

### 1. Moody's (MCO)
*   **Why it fits**: Moody's, a credit rating agency, operates in a predictable business where bonds require ratings regardless of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>. It has already built its brand and reputation, so it doesn't need significant new investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:19">[00:14:19]</a>. This allows it to raise prices disproportionately to its costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>.
*   **Performance**: From 2015 to the next year (estimated), its operating cash flow increased by 150%, while capital investment only rose by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>. Its free cash flow nearly tripled in 6-7 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:43">[00:16:43]</a>. Moody's has a low debt level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:23">[00:17:23]</a>, and its revenue growth is described as a "hyper straight line" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:08">[00:18:08]</a>. Companies pay for Moody's ratings to reduce interest costs on their bonds, providing an immediate value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### 2. Franco-Nevada (FNV)
*   **Why it fits**: Franco-Nevada is a gold royalty company that finances gold mining projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:09">[00:23:09]</a>. Instead of owning and operating mines (which have high capital costs), it receives a percentage of future gold production as royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:07">[00:24:07]</a>. The initial investment in financing these projects is made with "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:43">[00:24:43]</a>; the company doesn't have to bear the rising costs of building new mines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:58">[00:24:58]</a>.
*   **Performance**: The company's stock rose from $25 to $140 over 10 years, plus dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:46">[00:23:46]</a>. It has achieved a 20% annual return since its listing in 2007, outperforming Nasdaq, S&P 500, gold itself, and traditional gold mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:47">[00:25:47]</a>. Its revenue grew annually at 11%, and normalized profit at 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:56">[00:26:56]</a>.

### 3. MTEN (Restaurant Brands International â€“ Master Tenant)
*   **Why it fits**: MTEN owns the rights to fast-food franchises, collecting royalties based on restaurant sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>. Fast food performs well even during crises or high inflation because it's an affordable and essential product category <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:43">[00:27:43]</a>. When restaurants raise menu prices due to inflation, MTEN's income automatically increases without a proportional rise in its own operating costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:18">[00:30:18]</a>. Its central office staff can support significantly more sales without additional hiring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:30">[00:30:30]</a>.
*   **Performance**: MTEN reported record results in the last quarter, partly due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. The company has grown at an average of 15% annually in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:03">[00:31:03]</a> and is trading at 11 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">[00:31:05]</a>.

### 4. Residential Real Estate (REITs/Socimis)
*   **Why it fits**: Real estate [[investment opportunities during inflation | investment]] companies (REITs) have already invested "old dollars" in buying or building properties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:16">[00:33:16]</a>. Residential properties, like apartment buildings, provide predictable, recurring income, as people always need housing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:29">[00:33:29]</a>. Leases often have clauses linking rent increases to inflation (CPI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:37">[00:33:37]</a>. This allows income to rise without increasing investment levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:50">[00:33:50]</a>.
*   **Performance (Example: Residential REIT)**: One example mentioned (not held in the speaker's fund) started trading at $12 in 2015 and rose to $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:29">[00:34:29]</a>. Properties in favorable US states (Texas, Tennessee, Florida, Nevada, Arizona) are appreciating, with strong demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:02">[00:35:02]</a>. The company maintains a low debt leverage (below 50%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:39">[00:35:39]</a> and uses interest rate hedges to mitigate risk from rising rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:17">[00:36:17]</a>. It is raising rent for renewals by 6% and for new rentals by 15% annually, exceeding the 4-5% US inflation rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:52">[00:36:52]</a>. The company's adjusted earnings have doubled from 2015, and its net asset value is projected to grow due to property price increases, while debt remains fixed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:09">[00:41:09]</a>. It also pays an interesting dividend of 3% annually, which has been growing at 18% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:07">[00:42:07]</a>.

### 5. Financial Companies
*   **Why it fits**: Banks and financial companies, especially those providing loans, can perform well during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:07">[01:24:07]</a>. They have made their initial investments (loans) with "old dollars" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:58">[00:52:58]</a>. As interest rates rise with inflation, their income from new or adjusted loans increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. Clients often become more solvent as their cash flows increase in an inflationary environment, which can help maintain or even reduce delinquency rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:17">[01:24:17]</a>.
*   **Historical Context**: In the 1970s, a period of high inflation, banks were among the best-performing sectors, alongside mining and raw materials companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:45">[01:24:45]</a>.
*   **Example (Stone Company)**: Stone Company, a payment solutions provider in Brazil, benefits from the historically high commissions charged by traditional banks, allowing it to offer competitive rates to small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:00">[01:34:00]</a>. It also offers financing and advances cash flow, a valuable service for SMEs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:49">[01:01:49]</a>. It has grown its billing tenfold (from 170 million to 1.8 billion Brazilian reals) and operating profit tenfold (from 10 million to 1 billion Brazilian reals) in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:45">[01:02:45]</a>.

These examples illustrate how certain businesses, by their fundamental structure and market positioning, can navigate and even thrive in periods of high inflation, aligning with principles espoused by successful investors like Warren Buffett.

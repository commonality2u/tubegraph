One of the most crucial pieces of advice for beginners from Warren Buffett is to [[psychology_of_investing | invest]] using facts and not emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>. The primary reason many investors fail in the stock market is due to being dominated by their emotions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Insight

Warren Buffett noted that investors often get overly excited during bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. They tend to look at past performance, seeing significant gains, and are driven to continue buying stocks that are increasing in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>. Conversely, if a stock has not performed well during a bull market, people tend to dismiss it as a poor business and don't bother to analyze it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. This emotional response, according to Buffett, creates "giant opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>. This observation is particularly relevant in current bull markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.

## Case Study: Disney (DIS)

An illustrative example of this principle is Warren Buffett's favorite [[investing_in_bear_markets | investment]] in Disney <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Disney (listed in the US under the ticker IESE at $170 per share, as per transcript) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a> experienced sideways performance for five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a> while other stocks and the market were rising steadily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. However, in recent months, Disney's stock has more than doubled <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This surge occurred despite the business and its underlying assets remaining the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Such scenarios generate the "tremendous opportunities" that Warren Buffett highlights <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

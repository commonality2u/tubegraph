[[Bill Gates Economic Predictions and Concerns | Bill Gates]], one of the world's wealthiest and most influential individuals, has recently begun divesting shares from his stock market portfolio, a move potentially signaling economic concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. He has also stated that a new crisis is "practically certain" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article explores his reasons for selling shares, his negative outlook on specific economic sectors, and the investment opportunities he remains optimistic about <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Investment Acumen
[[Bill Gates Economic Predictions and Concerns | Bill Gates]] has amassed a fortune exceeding $120 billion, placing him as the fourth richest person globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>. While widely known as the co-founder of Microsoft, he is also an accomplished investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. His investments in Microsoft shares constitute only 40% of his assets, with the remaining 60% diversified across a stock portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. His deep understanding of the economy and stock market makes his recent portfolio changes and statements noteworthy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

## Past Predictions and Current Outlook
[[Bill Gates Economic Predictions and Concerns | Bill Gates]] played a significant role during a recent global crisis. He previously warned of a likely pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>, predicted which company would first develop a vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>, and even provided an approximate date for the end of the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>.

### Certainty of a New Economic Crisis
During a live Q&A session, when asked about the possibility of an economic crisis similar to 2008, [[Bill Gates Economic Predictions and Concerns | Bill Gates]] responded that it is "certain that we will have a crisis similar to that of 2008 in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This prediction has led many investors to question if his current accelerated selling of shares is linked to this vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>.

### Pandemic Duration and Economic Consequences
In a February interview with CNN, [[Bill Gates Economic Predictions and Concerns | Bill Gates]] warned that the current global health issue could persist longer than anticipated, leading to severe economic repercussions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:03">[00:03:03]</a>. He emphasized that insufficient global action to end the pandemic, particularly the uneven distribution of vaccines to rich countries, increases the risk of new variants spreading and returning, posing the main economic risk for the coming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.
[[Bill Gates prediction on crisis resolution | Bill Gates]] projects that the economy will return to normal by the end of 2022, a more conservative outlook than the widespread belief of late 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>. This perspective likely influences his current [[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio | investment strategy and portfolio]] adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

## Investment Strategy Shifts
Based on transparency rules for professional investors managing over $100 million, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation's recent report indicates significant portfolio changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. [[Bill Gates selling shares and reasons behind it | Bill Gates]] has begun selling 11 of his 18 holdings, purchasing only one new stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

### Divesting from Technology and High-Valuation Stocks
[[Bill Gates investment strategy and portfolio | Bill Gates' investment activity]] shows three key trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>:
*   **Selling Technology Stocks**: He has sold all his technology stocks, including Amazon, Google, and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. These companies were major beneficiaries of recent global issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Selling Uber Shares**: All shares of Uber were sold due to high valuation and the company's fragility during an economic downturn, as it does not produce profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.
*   **Selling Alibaba Shares**: Shares in Alibaba, listed under the ticker "BABA" at $225 per share, were sold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>. Despite Alibaba being a strong company, regulatory issues in China caused panic among investors and a sharp fall in share price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. While a delisting from US exchanges or profitability-affecting actions are unlikely ("tail risk"), [[Bill Gates investing strategies | Bill Gates]] has opted for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Positioning for "The Great Rotation"
[[Bill Gates Investment Strategy and Portfolio Changes | Bill Gates' portfolio]] appears to be positioning for "the great rotation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. While technology, disruptive companies, and startups have seen strong revaluations over the past three years, more traditional and conservative companies have lagged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>. These traditional companies now trade at attractive valuations due to low recent interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. [[Bill Gates Focus on Defensive Investments and Sectors | Bill Gates]] seems to be anticipating a shift of capital from disruptive/technological companies to traditional, and specifically, more defensive or crisis-resistant companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

## Optimistic and Defensive Investments
[[Bill Gates Focus on Defensive Investments and Sectors | Bill Gates]] remains optimistic about certain investments, concentrating in traditional and defensive sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

### Berkshire Hathaway
His primary investment is in [[Warren Buffett]]'s business holding company, Berkshire Hathaway (NYSE: BRK.A), with a 43% weighting and over $9 billion invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. This reflects the strong friendship between [[Bill Gates]] and [[Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway is positioned to withstand any economic environment, providing acceptable returns to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>. Its profits and book value per share are estimated to grow between 7% and 12% annually, potentially reaching over $400 per share from its current $250 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:30">[00:07:30]</a>. It is considered a very conservative and safe investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.

### Waste Management
[[Bill Gates]]' second favorite stock is Waste Management (NYSE: WM), representing 10% of his portfolio with an investment of over $2 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. As the leading US waste collection and recycling company, it is a traditional business highly resilient to crises and predictable in any economic climate, aligning with [[Bill Gates]]' new portfolio vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. The recycling market is projected to grow well above GDP, at 9% annually, especially in North America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>. Waste Management, currently trading at a fair valuation of 25 times its annual earnings, has historically grown earnings per share at 10% per year, with a potential future value of $200 per share from its current $115 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.

### Walmart and Canadian National Railway
[[Bill Gates]]' portfolio also includes Walmart (NYSE: WMT), the largest global supermarket chain, representing 9% of his portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Walmart is a conservative company that performs well in any economic environment, offering moderate profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.
He also invests in Canadian National Railway (NYSE: CNI) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. Railroad companies are among the safest transportation investments due to the difficulty of rivals building parallel lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. Rail remains a cost-competitive technology for transporting goods like raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. Canadian National Railway, also fairly valued, could see its profits grow by 10% annually, potentially reaching $200 per share from its current $115 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.

### Other Blue-Chip Companies
[[Bill Gates Focus on Defensive Investments and Sectors | Bill Gates]] maintains high-quality "blue-chip" companies in his portfolio, such as FedEx, UPS, and Caterpillar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. These are large-cap companies that provide stable and adequate returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>.

## New High-Growth Investment: Schrödinger
The only new stock [[Bill Gates]] has recently purchased is Schrödinger (NASDAQ: SDGR), investing over $500 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. Schrödinger is a highly innovative company that assists pharmaceutical companies in developing new drugs and vaccines more quickly and effectively through its technological platform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:56">[00:11:56]</a>. This company holds high growth potential, with the US medical research and clinical trials market valued at $47 billion annually, while Schrödinger currently bills only $150 million per year, despite growing at over 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. The main challenge is its demanding valuation, trading at over 40 times sales and not yet producing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. This investment likely reflects [[Bill Gates]]' very long-term vision, anticipating significant value if the company captures even 10% of this vast market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

[[Bill Gates Investment Strategy and Portfolio Changes | Bill Gates]]' more conservative view on the future of the economy and his extended timeline for normalcy appear to be the primary drivers behind these strategic shifts in his investment portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:12">[00:13:12]</a>.

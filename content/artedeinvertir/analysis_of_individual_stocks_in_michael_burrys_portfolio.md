After years away from public appearances, Burry recently shared his portfolio composition and investment philosophy in an interview with an O Barnes newspaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. His current stock portfolio is highly concentrated, consisting of just six stocks, valued at approximately $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Investment Philosophy

[[michael_burrys_investment_strategy_and_theories | Michael Burry's investment strategy]] is characterized by its contrarian nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. He aims to acquire shares in companies that are "ignored" or appear to be on the verge of bankruptcy, then sells them once they show slight improvement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. He emphasizes that portfolio management is as crucial as company selection for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>.

Burry's portfolio often mixes:
*   **Contrarian Stocks**:: Companies that are out of fashion, significantly undervalued, or "crushed by the market," but trading at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   **High-Quality Stocks**:: Companies with strong competitive advantages and high returns on capital, which he's willing to invest in if offered at reasonable prices, reminiscent of [[analysis_of_warren_buffetts_stock_recommendations | Warren Buffett's]] preferences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

He prefers a concentrated portfolio, typically holding between 12 and 18 stocks, with anything under 25 stocks considered concentrated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. This approach allows him to focus on his best ideas while managing volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>. His current portfolio heavily favors the retail and energy sectors, which are currently out of fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>.

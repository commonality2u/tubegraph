Central banks have directly stated that an [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | economic recession]] is imminent in the first quarter of 2023, signaling a new era for investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Specifically, the eurozone is anticipated to enter a [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recession]] in Q1 2023, with the United States also facing a "quite imminent" danger of [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:00">[00:01:00]</a>. This shift is expected to change investment strategies significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>.

## Central Bank Forecasts and Actions
The Central Bank surprised the market by indicating that [[predictions_on_interest_rates_and_economic_trends | rate hikes]] are not yet over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>. They plan to increase rates by 0.5% in probably each of the next three meetings, aiming to reach 4% for now <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This expectation had not been priced in by the market and is now influencing downward valuations in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Furthermore, a monthly withdrawal of 15 billion in liquidity from the system is set to begin in March, effectively reversing previous actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. The [[federal_reserve_report_on_economic_forecasts | Federal Reserve's last meeting]] did not offer many surprises, and the most significant market influence has been the Central Bank's statements from a Thursday meeting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

## Leading Economic Indicators
Historically, the number of new industrial orders in the United States has been a reliable indicator of [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recessions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. When this indicator crosses a certain orange line, [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recessions]] have followed, as seen in 2000-2001, 2008, and 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>. Currently, this indicator is again in the "danger zone," suggesting high probabilities of a [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>.

Leading economic activity indicators are considered very powerful, unlike lagging indicators such as unemployment or GDP, which normally act in advance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. The ease of purchasing housing in the United States, significantly impacted by rising [[predictions_on_interest_rates_and_economic_trends | interest rates]], is currently at levels seen prior to the 2007-2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. The real estate and construction sectors carry significant weight in the economy, and conditions in Europe are also expected to become more complicated due to rising [[predictions_on_interest_rates_and_economic_trends | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:36">[00:03:36]</a>.

## Howard Marks' Perspective on Market Changes
Howard Marks, an investor highly regarded by Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>, views the current economic environment as a "transcendental change" in investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He states that in his 53 years of investing, he has only witnessed two such "transcendental changes" that altered the market structure and what strategies worked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. He believes we are now experiencing the third such change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. Marks, through his investment fund manager, Oaktree Capital Management, has surpassed [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_recession | Ray Dalio]]'s investment fund, accumulating $160 trillion in assets with solid, predictable double-digit returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

The previous theme of recent years was the massive printing of money by central banks, which was closely correlated with the S&P 500's rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. This money reached the economy through easy credit and government aid, creating short-to-medium term economic booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. However, forecasts now indicate this money will be withdrawn, with the balance normalizing over the next two to three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>. This means the investment environment will not be the same as in the past, hence the new paradigm shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. Marks believes strategies that worked over the last 13 years (the second phase of change) will no longer be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>.

## Key Investment Themes in a New Paradigm
Howard Marks identifies four strategies that have fundamentally worked well in the past 13 years but are now changing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>:

### 1. Passive vs. Active Investment
The 2008 crisis marked a significant shift towards passive or indexed investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. While active investment involves selecting individual shares, passive investment, like buying into the S&P 500, gained immense capital inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>. This trend was fueled by easy money and a market where everything was rising, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. However, there's a warning about this, as performance expectations may not be met in the short term, leading to disappointment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>.

### 2. Growth vs. Value Investing
Recently, the "growth style" of investing, often in unprofitable companies that issued shares to finance losses, has been dominant, peaking in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. This includes companies like Beyond, Peloton, Palantir, Shopify, and Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. This unsustainable growth contrasts with "value investment," which focuses on buying companies with solid profits and rational growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>. Value investing is currently quite cheap compared to historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

### 3. Small Caps vs. Large Caps
Historically, small-cap companies have provided higher returns due to being less followed, having less liquidity, and greater growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. However, since 2008, large companies, such as those in the S&P 500, have significantly outperformed small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>. The S&P 500 doubled in this period (9-10% annually), while the Russell 2000 only rose 50% (4-5% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Small caps are currently much cheaper than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>, suggesting a potential recovery of lost ground.

### 4. US vs. International Markets
In recent years, the United States market has performed exceptionally well compared to the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>. The S&P 500 had a 230% return over 12 years (until 2020-2021), while European or emerging markets had a poor performance, gaining only 50% (around 4% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:31">[00:13:31]</a>. Howard Marks now suggests the opposite, expecting international stocks to outperform the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>. Currently, the rest of the world is trading at a significant discount (25-30%) compared to the United States market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

## Consumer Savings and Debt
Central banks are confident about the [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recession]] because consumption, which drives 70% of the economy, is impacted when people lack savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>. The COVID-19 pandemic led to a large excess of savings, but inflation has eroded these savings, and people are now facing indebtedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>. Personal savings have returned to 2008 crisis levels, while credit card, personal loan, and mortgage debt are quite high, especially with rising [[predictions_on_interest_rates_and_economic_trends | interest rates]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>.

## Sector Performance During Recession and Recovery
During a [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recession]] and subsequent recovery, certain sectors tend to perform differently:
*   **Recession Phase (Economy Contracting)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>:
    *   **Poorly performing:** Technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:41">[00:17:41]</a>.
    *   **Potentially well-performing:** Energy (due to energy inflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Recovery Phase** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>:
    *   **Strongly performing:** Discretionary consumption (e.g., cars), as the market anticipates recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>. Most sectors tend to do well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Less beneficial:** Safer sectors like health, energy, and utilities, which typically do not suffer in crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.

## Real-world Examples of Paradigm Shifts

### Small Caps vs. Large Caps: Grupeguillin vs. J. Maki
Grupeguillin, a small company making packaging for the food sector, is not included in major indices and has low liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:31">[00:22:31]</a>. Despite consistent, predictable growth (averaging 5% annually) and low debt, it is often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.

In contrast, J. Maki, a larger Finnish company also making plastic containers, is ten times larger, has more liquidity, and is included in more indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:31">[00:24:31]</a>. While it has grown similarly (6% annually), it trades at a 60% higher valuation than Grupeguillin, despite having twice the debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>. This illustrates a valuation divergence where larger, indexed companies are more favored <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:37">[00:25:37]</a>. Historically, small companies were valued similarly or even higher due to their growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:16">[00:26:16]</a>.

### Indexed vs. Non-Indexed Companies: GDI vs. Compass Group
GDI, a Canadian company providing building maintenance services, is resistant to crises, has grown 20% annually, and has a controlled debt level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:27">[00:28:27]</a>. However, its low trading volume and absence from major indices like the Toronto 30, MSC, or S&P 500 mean it's often overlooked <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">[00:29:08]</a>.

Compass Group, one of the largest building service companies globally, is much larger and included in main European and UK indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:35">[00:30:35]</a>. Despite growing less (6% annually compared to GDI's 20%), people are willing to pay a double valuation for Compass Group simply because it's in the indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.

### US vs. International Markets: Globan vs. Nagarro
Globan, a large US digital engineering company, has seen strong growth (30% average annual revenue growth, 25% profit growth) and was included in many growth indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:13">[00:34:13]</a>. However, its valuation has become very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>.

Nagarro, a smaller German-listed company in the same sector, is not in major US indices, giving it a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:50">[00:34:50]</a>. Despite Nagarro growing more than Globan this year (40% vs. 35%), Globan still trades at double the valuation (nearly 30 times earnings compared to Nagarro's estimated 12-13 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:54">[00:35:54]</a>.

### Value vs. Growth Investing: Berkshire Hathaway vs. Ark Innovation ETF
The "growth at any price" strategy, valuing companies by sales instead of profits, led to a bubble in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:16">[00:36:16]</a>. This involved unprofitable businesses issuing many shares (stock-based compensation) at "stratospheric prices" to enrich directors, often at the shareholder's expense <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:01">[00:37:01]</a>. Companies like Carvana and many crypto-related stocks have lost 90-95% of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:38">[00:37:38]</a>. Many of these stocks, despite huge drops, remain expensive, indicating the scale of the past bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:33">[00:38:33]</a>.

The Ark Innovation ETF, representing this disruptive technological investment, has lost 64% this year, making recovery very difficult <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:46">[00:38:46]</a>. In contrast, Berkshire Hathaway, led by Warren Buffett (a proponent of [[investment_strategies_during_economic_recessions | value investing]]), has remained sideways in a difficult market year, neither gaining nor losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:00">[00:39:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the struggles of highly speculative growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:17">[00:39:17]</a>.

Berry Global, a company in the industrial packaging sector, demonstrates the value approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:31">[00:39:31]</a>. It has consistently grown sales (11% annually) and profits (17% annually) with good capital management, expanding margins, and generating free cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:50">[00:39:50]</a>. Despite its strong performance, its valuation has compressed "brutally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:27">[00:41:27]</a>. It is currently trading at only eight times earnings, half its normal PER of 15, indicating it is significantly undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:00">[00:41:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategy in a Downturn
In [[recession_predictions_and_impact | bear markets]], especially those affecting small and medium-sized companies, forced sales occur as liquidity is withdrawn and panic spreads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>. This creates "ridiculous situations" where high-quality companies with low debt and good management trade at very low valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:34">[00:21:34]</a>.

For instance, companies like GDI published record results in a quarter where [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recession]] was discussed, yet their stock went down due to liquidity withdrawal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:00">[00:58:00]</a>. When a company's stock falls due to market fear unrelated to its fundamental business performance, the risk of permanent loss is significantly reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[00:59:58]</a>.

Investors should focus on "cockroach business models" that are resilient and can survive economic shocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:08">[01:04:08]</a>. Examples include Go Easy and Berry Global, which demonstrate stable performance even with some variability during [[recession_predictions_and_impact | recessions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>. The current environment is seen as an ideal time to train and take advantage of opportunities, as significant money is often made in the stock market during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:18">[01:19:18]</a>.

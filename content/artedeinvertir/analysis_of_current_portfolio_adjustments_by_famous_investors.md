This article examines recent portfolio adjustments made by prominent investors like Ray Dalio, Warren Buffett, and Michael Burry, as well as the investment strategies of notable funds. The analysis focuses on how these investors are positioning their portfolios in response to the current economic climate and future forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Defensive Positioning

Ray Dalio, manager of the world's largest investment fund, has issued a new warning about significant future changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His portfolio shows a shift towards a more defensive stance, with significant selling of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Dalio gained fame for predicting the 2008 financial crisis and has successfully navigated market downturns over the past 20-30 years with minimal losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>.

### Warnings and Economic Outlook
Dalio's warnings are based on several factors:
*   **Political Polarization:** A tremendous political polarization in the United States between Republicans and Democrats, with some even mentioning the risk of civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.
*   **Shift in World Power:** The center of world power is rotating from the United States to China, potentially causing future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
*   **End of "Easy Money":** A change in policy by central banks, moving away from easy money and low interest rates, which could have serious market consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.
*   **Market Excesses:** "Madness" in the crypto world and certain technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>.
*   **Future Financial Conditions:** Investors must adapt to central banks no longer providing free money, coupled with periods of high inflation and more difficult financial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

He anticipates much lower rates of return in markets and investments in the future, possibly 3-4% annually compared to the past 8-10%, with a much higher level of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

### Portfolio Adjustments
Ray Dalio has sold 90% of his shares and reduced his weight in almost 300 other shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:19">[00:07:19]</a>.
*   **Sales:** He sold almost all of his shares in emerging countries and technology ETFs, considering them risky assets that tend to correct more during volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>.
*   **Purchases:** His purchases have been in defensive shares, which are expected to perform better if the market corrects significantly. Examples include Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. These stocks tend to fall much less when the market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

## Market Trends and Overvalued Stocks
The current economic scenario, driven by central bank policy changes, has led to significant drops in many overvalued technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. Companies that were trading at very demanding multiples have experienced severe falls of 50% to 80% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:25">[00:09:25]</a>.

### Mark Leonard's Approach to Tech Valuations
Mark Leonard, CEO of Constellation Software, a highly successful technology holding company, offers insights into valuing tech businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:08">[00:12:08]</a>. Constellation Software has grown from less than $20 to over $2,000 in 15 years, multiplying its value by 100 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. Leonard, an admirer of [[investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]], advises that good technology businesses should never trade above five times their sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>. He considers multiples below two times sales as a good investment if the company is strong and has growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Many popular tech stocks, despite recent drops, are still trading above these recommended multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Portfolio: Activison Blizzard Acquisition
Recent reports show [[popular_stocks_among_prominent_investors | Warren Buffett]]'s Berkshire Hathaway initiated a position in Activision Blizzard in the fourth quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:16">[00:17:16]</a>. This led to speculation that his long-standing friendship with Bill Gates, founder of Microsoft (which acquired Activision Blizzard), influenced the purchase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

However, several points debunk this:
*   **Buffett's Stance on Microsoft:** Buffett has stated he never invested in Microsoft due to his friendship with Bill Gates, specifically to avoid misunderstandings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:26">[00:19:26]</a>. Microsoft's value has multiplied by over 100 times since their friendship began in the early 90s, and it would have been a perfectly legal and logical investment for Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:42">[00:19:42]</a>.
*   **Sub-Manager Decisions:** Operations under $2 billion-$5 billion are typically handled by Buffett's sub-managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs, not Buffett directly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:24">[00:20:24]</a>.
*   **Past Holdings:** Berkshire Hathaway has owned Activision in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:43">[00:20:43]</a>.
*   **Circle of Competence:** The argument that Activision is outside Buffett's "circle of competence" because he doesn't play video games is flawed. Understanding a business doesn't require personal consumption of its products; it's about understanding its earning potential and franchise value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:01">[00:21:01]</a>.
*   **Bill Gates's Role:** Bill Gates is no longer on the board of directors of Microsoft or Berkshire Hathaway, acting merely as an external shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.

This highlights the importance of [[analysis_of_investment_strategies_for_private_investors | independent thinking]] and checking facts rather than succumbing to conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:06">[00:18:06]</a>.

## Michael Burry's New Buys
Michael Burry, known for "The Big Short," has recently acquired interesting shares:
*   **Bristol Myers:** A biotechnology company trading at a multiple of 10 times earnings, below the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics:** This company manufactures military equipment like nuclear submarines, facing virtually no competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:31">[00:25:31]</a>. It possesses a high competitive advantage with non-cyclical demand due to defense budgets. Burry also invested in Lockheed Martin recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:24">[00:25:24]</a>. Trading at its historical average of 15 times earnings, it's considered a defensive stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:02">[00:28:02]</a>.
*   **Fidelity National Financial:** This company is a leader in mortgage title insurance in the US, a very lucrative niche where practically everyone buys insurance to cover hidden debts or building permit issues when buying a house <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:49">[00:28:49]</a>. It's currently trading at historical lows (8 times earnings compared to a typical 14-15 times) while home sales are increasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:05">[00:30:05]</a>.

## Bill Miller's Portfolio Additions
Bill Miller, a legendary investor known for beating the S&P 500 for nearly 20 consecutive years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:49">[00:30:49]</a>, has recently added positions to DXC Technology. This company suffered significantly on the stock market due to an initial high valuation and business deterioration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:13">[00:32:13]</a>. It is currently listed at only eight times earnings, which is very low compared to rivals, suggesting a potential undervaluation if the business stabilizes or grows slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:31">[00:33:31]</a>. Miller has also made significant gains from investments in Bitcoin and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.

## Hyper-Concentrated Portfolios
Some lesser-known but highly successful funds maintain hyper-concentrated portfolios, often with less than ten stocks, all chosen for their exceptional quality and competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:18">[00:34:18]</a>. These funds often hold positions in large tech companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook, along with financial giants like Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a>.

### Visa and Mastercard
Visa and Mastercard have recently seen increased positions due to a temporary scare in the market. Despite initial fears about alliances with Amazon and "buy now, pay later" companies, these concerns were found to be temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:14">[00:35:14]</a>.
*   Their recent results were spectacular, with profits growing over 40% and billing exceeding 2019 levels, even before a full recovery in tourism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:03">[00:36:03]</a>.
*   They project annualized earnings per share growth of 20-23% for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:04">[00:37:04]</a>.
*   Valuation: After recent drops, they are trading at levels (around 31 times earnings) consistent with their historical average during more normalized interest rate environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:03">[00:38:03]</a>. This suggests a potential for significant intrinsic value appreciation in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:47">[00:38:47]</a>.

## True Value Fund's Investment Strategy
The speaker's own True Value fund emphasizes investing in companies below their intrinsic value and focusing on long-term value creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:17">[00:44:17]</a>. This fund uses a strategy rooted in [[stock_analysis_and_investment_strategies | in-depth analysis]] and [[investment_strategies_of_successful_investors | proven methodologies]] .

### Key Holdings and Performance
*   **Humana (Uman):** Published strong results, beating market expectations, and continues to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:30">[00:44:30]</a>. The company itself is buying back shares because they believe they are trading below intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:38">[00:48:38]</a>.
*   **Google (Alphabet):** Despite good results, the stock price has fallen due to current bear market behavior, presenting a cheaper entry point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:00">[01:13:00]</a>.
*   **MT Group:** A defensive business with good growth prospects, trading at a reasonable valuation of 9-10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>. The company's management has been buying back shares and has expressed optimism about normalizing acquisition environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:25">[00:54:25]</a>.
*   **Facebook:** Experienced a significant drop, but the fund views its current valuation (around 13-14 times future profits, excluding cash) as historically low, presenting a buying opportunity despite market negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:36">[00:56:36]</a>.
*   **Nordic Kings (Real Estate like SBB):** These companies operate in the stable Nordic real estate sector. Despite fears of interest rate hikes impacting valuations, inflation simultaneously increases property values, making them strong assets in such an environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:18">[01:18:18]</a>. SBB is trading at one times book value, which is historically low for a company with a high return on equity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:26">[01:26:26]</a>.

### Lessons from Past Mistakes
The fund acknowledges past mistakes, such as selling high-growth stocks like Constellation Software and Heico too early, even when they appeared expensive compared to historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:36">[01:02:36]</a>. This demonstrates the importance of adapting portfolio management concepts to different types of investment themes (cyclical, high-growth, low-growth, special situations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:00">[01:07:00]</a>.

### Market Volatility and Opportunities
The speaker emphasizes that volatility and market downturns are ideal times for investors to train and find exceptional investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:13">[01:42:13]</a>. The fund actively uses capital inflows to buy during these periods, viewing price drops as opportunities to increase positions in fundamentally strong companies that are trading below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:17">[01:00:17]</a>. The fund practices [[rebalancing_investment_portfolios | rebalancing]] by considering selling safer shares to take advantage of new opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:03">[01:02:03]</a>.

> [!info] Investment Philosophy
> The core philosophy is to buy good businesses at reasonable valuations, focusing on their intrinsic value generation in the long term, rather than short-term market fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:16">[01:46:16]</a>. This contrasts with common market behavior where people only look at valuation when stocks are rising and fundamentals are ignored when prices fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.

For individual investors, it's crucial to cultivate independent thinking, learn to value shares, and understand market structures to make informed decisions and avoid being "stock market tourists" who suffer losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

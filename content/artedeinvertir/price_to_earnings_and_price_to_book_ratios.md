To succeed in the world of finance and investment, one should strive to pay less than what an asset is truly worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The challenge lies in accurately calculating this worth, academically known as intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. For a stock like Microsoft, the goal is to buy when the stock price is below the estimated intrinsic value; a greater difference often leads to a greater potential return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. If [[Valuation and growth potential of companies | valuation]] is done well, the market will eventually align with the estimated value within one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. However, many investors lack the patience for this time horizon, leading to suboptimal returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

The academic definition of intrinsic value is based on [[Understanding Financial Metrics and Valuations | discounted cash flows (DCF)]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. This method involves discounting a company's projected lifetime earnings at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. However, investing is considered an art rather than an exact science, making it difficult to predict a company's earnings 10 to 15 years into the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. A significant problem with the DCF method is that the profits from the next five years have a very small impact on the final [[Evaluating company valuations and market conditions | valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. For example, if a share trades at 30 euros, the next five years might only influence 10-20% of that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>. Although scientifically rigorous, this method often lacks practical utility in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

Due to the unreliability of DCF, [[Valuation by multiples | valuation by multiples]] emerged as a more practical approach <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. This involves predicting what a business will earn in the more visible future (e.g., 3-5 years) and updating the [[Valuation of stocks and market dynamics | valuation]] over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

## Price to Earnings (P/E) Ratio

The Price to Earnings (P/E) ratio, often referred to as PER, is the most common method for [[Stock Analysis and Investment Strategies | valuing shares]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

### Formula and Calculation

The P/E ratio is calculated by dividing the company's price (or market capitalization) by its earnings (or net accounting profit) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>
> Price / Earnings per share
> OR
> Market Capitalization / Net Accounting Profit

Market capitalization is obtained by multiplying the number of shares by the current stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

### Example: Inditex

If Inditex is listed at 27 euros and is expected to earn approximately one euro per share this year, its P/E ratio would be 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. This is considered a high P/E, as the stock market typically trades at an average of 15-16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. The current American market averages around 18 times, while the European market is at 13-14 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.

### Interpretation and Caveats

The P/E ratio is a static multiple, measuring today's price against today's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. However, investors often estimate future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. If Inditex's earnings per share are expected to double to two euros in three to five years, the P/E ratio would effectively reduce to 13 times (27/2), making it a more attractive investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>. A high P/E ratio for a stock often indicates that investors anticipate significant future earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>.

Conversely, a low P/E ratio can sometimes signal a "value trap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. If a company's earnings are expected to decline in the future (e.g., from 1 euro to 0.5 euro), then the seemingly low P/E of 27 could effectively become 50 (27/0.5), leading to a downward adjustment in the stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. Low P/E in large-cap companies often suggests the market is anticipating future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>.

Different industries require different P/E multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. For example, automotive companies or airlines may rarely trade above 8-10 times P/E <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>, while high-quality companies may trade above 18-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>. The P/E also incorporates expectations of future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:32">[00:07:32]</a>.

A P/E ratio of 10 might suggest an equivalent annual return of 10% (recovering your investment in 10 years), but this is only true if the company's profits remain stable or do not grow, and if it pays out all profits as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. A P/E of 20 implies a 5% annual return under the same conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>. This inverse relationship (1/P/E) gives the earnings yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.

Historically, buying companies with a low P/E has yielded an average return of 12-13%, compared to the market average of 9-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. This highlights why [[Valuation techniques for stocks and investment strategies | value investing]] (buying assets for less than their market price) is effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.

### Limitation: Debt

A key limitation of the P/E ratio is that it does not account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. When using P/E, only the equity or net worth of the company is valued, disregarding its liabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>. Companies with significant debt may appear to have very low P/E ratios (e.g., 4-5 times) due to this omission <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. Other [[Valuation by multiples | valuation by multiples]] methods, such as Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA), do incorporate the full capital structure (equity and debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.

## Price to Book (P/B) Ratio

The Price to Book (P/B) ratio, or Price to Book Value, is another [[Valuation by multiples | valuation multiple]] based on a company's accounting records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>.

### Concept

The P/B ratio compares the company's market price to its book value, which represents the net assets (assets minus liabilities) as recorded in the company's books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:45">[00:19:45]</a>. It's a straightforward method that involves simply looking at how much the company's books say it's worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.

### Example: Inditex

If Inditex's book value was approximately 10 billion, but its market capitalization was 80 billion, its P/B ratio would be roughly 8 times its book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:02">[00:20:02]</a>.

### Interpretation and Caveats

A high P/B multiple often indicates that a business's competitive advantage (e.g., brand reputation) is based on intangible assets that are not fully captured in its accounting books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:21">[00:20:21]</a>. For companies like Coca-Cola or Procter & Gamble, whose value derives from brand trust and consumer loyalty, the book value may not reflect their true worth, leading to high P/B ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:33">[00:20:33]</a>.

Conversely, companies with tangible assets and more transactional businesses, such as a maritime transport company that owns ships, tend to list closer to their book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. Similarly, banks or mining companies often trade at 1.5 to 2 times their book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:28">[00:21:28]</a>.

To calculate the P/B per share, divide the total book value by the number of shares in circulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:44">[00:21:44]</a>. As with P/E, different industries command different P/B ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:56">[00:21:56]</a>.

While buying below book value offers a margin of safety, it's crucial to understand the true quality of the underlying assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>. Accounting rules might require valuing assets in a certain way, but their real market value could be lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>. Therefore, the P/B ratio is not as commonly used as other [[Valuation and performance of specific stocks and sectors | valuation methods]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:32">[00:22:32]</a>.

## Other Related [[Valuation by multiples | Valuation Methods]]

While P/E and P/B are fundamental, other methods complement them:

*   **Enterprise Value to EBITDA (EV/EBITDA):** This method explicitly incorporates a company's debt, unlike the P/E ratio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a>. It's often considered more robust for comparing similar companies across different industries, as it provides a broader view of the company's total value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:31">[00:11:31]</a>. Historically, buying companies with a low EV/EBITDA multiple has yielded higher returns than buying companies with low P/E ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

*   **Net Asset Value (NAV):** Used for companies that own other easily valued assets (e.g., shares in other listed companies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:45">[00:22:45]</a>. The NAV is calculated by summing the value of all individual assets and dividing by the number of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:15">[00:23:15]</a>. Such companies typically trade at a discount (e.g., 20%) to their NAV, as the market anticipates a potential price drop if those assets were to be liquidated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:28">[00:23:28]</a>.

*   **Sum of the Parts (SOTP):** Similar to NAV but for companies with different business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:53">[00:23:53]</a>. It involves valuing each distinct business segment separately with appropriate multiples (e.g., a lower multiple for a "bad" business, a higher multiple for a "good" business) and then summing these individual valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:17">[00:24:17]</a>.

*   **Price to Free Cash Flow (P/FCF):** A variation of the P/E ratio, using free cash flow instead of net profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. Free cash flow is a more refined measure of profit, taking into account depreciation and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:28">[00:26:28]</a>. Like P/E, it does not account for debt or leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:42">[00:26:42]</a>.

These [[Company earnings and stock market trends | valuation metrics]] provide different lenses through which to assess a company's worth, with each having its own strengths and weaknesses. Selecting the appropriate method depends on the specific characteristics of the company and industry being analyzed.

Float, a term popularized by [[Warren Buffett]] (Warren Buffett), refers to the money an insurance company holds that does not belong to it but can be invested for its own benefit before being paid out as compensation [00:04:08]. This unique financial characteristic is a primary reason why the insurance sector has been exceptionally profitable for investors like [[Warren Buffett]] (Warren Buffett) throughout history.

## How Float is Generated

When a policyholder pays an insurance premium at the beginning of the year for policies such as car, house, or life insurance, the insurer receives this money upfront [00:04:17]. The insurer knows that, on average, they will only need to pay a portion of this collected money in compensation over the next 6, 12, 24 months, or even longer (e.g., receiving $1,000 but only paying out $900) [00:04:31]. During this period, before claims are settled and compensation is paid, the insurer has the legal right to invest this "free money" [00:04:49].

## Investment Strategies for Float

Traditional banks typically have to pay interest to depositors for the money they hold, but insurers do not have this obligation for their float [00:04:56]. This gives insurers a unique advantage, as they earn profit not only from selling the insurance itself (the "technical result" or "combined ratio") but also from investing the float [00:05:05].

However, the law regulates how this float can be invested to ensure solvency and liquidity for paying claims. Typically, insurers invest the vast majority of their float in low-risk assets like treasury bills, fixed income, and short-term bonds (maximum 3-5 years), with only a small portion (10-15%) potentially allocated to the stock market or real estate [00:05:25].

### Warren Buffett's Approach to Float

[[Warren Buffett]] (Warren Buffett) recognized the immense potential of float. Being highly skilled in stock investing, he strategically acquired insurance companies with longer compensation payout periods (1-4 years) [00:06:02]. This extended timeframe allowed him to invest a larger portion of the float more aggressively in stocks than traditional insurers, balancing market volatility and accelerating wealth generation [00:06:09]. Studies suggest that 40-50% of [[Berkshire Hathaway]]'s historical performance can be attributed to this intelligent utilization of float [00:06:21].

As of March 2024, [[Berkshire Hathaway]] (Berkshire Hathaway) held an impressive $168 billion in float from its insurance businesses [00:06:49]. Even a conservative annual return of 5-7% on this float could generate over $20 billion in pre-tax profits, underscoring its significant contribution to the company's value [00:07:04]. This float has shown consistent growth over time [00:07:26].

## Key Examples

*   **Geico:** One of [[Warren Buffett]]'s (Warren Buffett's) most successful investments in the insurance sector, Geico (a low-cost auto insurer) has seen its income skyrocket to nearly $20 billion, significantly contributing to [[Warren Buffett]]'s (Warren Buffett's) fortune [00:02:18].
*   **Chap (CB):** [[Warren Buffett]] (Warren Buffett) recently invested an estimated $7 billion in Chap, an insurer focused on property and casualty insurance for corporations [00:01:14]. Chap's strong profitability is evident, with almost 60% of its $9 billion profit in a recent year stemming from its float investments [00:10:20]. Chap manages a float of $120 billion [00:33:56] and maintains a conservative investment philosophy, with 84% of its portfolio in debt instruments with a maximum duration of five years [00:31:03].

## Profitability and Competitive Advantage

The insurance business model, particularly with the strategic use of float, is highly profitable. Companies like Chap consistently achieve higher profit margins compared to their rivals due to their discipline in underwriting and managing risk [00:28:59]. This deep understanding of risk, often supported by extensive data (Big Data), creates a competitive advantage, making it difficult for new entrants to profitably compete by simply lowering prices [02:06:09].

## Impact of Interest Rates

Interest rates significantly influence the profitability of float. During periods of low interest rates, insurance companies' investment returns from their float tend to be lower, impacting overall profitability [00:34:57]. Conversely, when interest rates are high, as seen since 2022-2023, insurers can achieve higher returns by investing their float in instruments like treasury bills, which offer improved yields (e.g., 5.5% in the U.S.) [00:35:00]. This dynamic means that higher interest rates generally increase the profitability of insurance companies.

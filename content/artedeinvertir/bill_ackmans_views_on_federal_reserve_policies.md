The renowned investor [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Bill Ackman]], known for his accurate market predictions, has articulated a potential "significant collapse" in the market unless specific actions are taken by the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Federal Reserve]] (Fed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. He has also shared his recommended investment strategies for the current economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Inflation Concerns

According to [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Bill Ackman]], the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] must adopt a much more aggressive stance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This urgency has been highlighted by significant market falls due to unexpected inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Key indicators reflect a challenging economic climate:
*   **Consumer Confidence** is at historic lows, even worse than during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This is critical given that 70% of the American economy relies on consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.
*   **Mortgage Applications** in the U.S. have plummeted to a 22-year low, impacting the housing market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>. The interest rate on typical 30-year mortgages has reached 62%â€”a level not seen in decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Inflation Concerns** are high among consumers, particularly due to rising gasoline prices, which severely affect consumer confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The University of Michigan's consumer confidence survey, a crucial indicator, had a notably negative impact on the market upon its release <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>.

[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Ackman]] highlights that while unemployment is at a low point (which is generally positive), the *expected change* in unemployment is negative for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. More critically, people are beginning to perceive inflation as permanent rather than temporary, which alters market psychology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>. Inflation expectations for the next three years have risen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>.

Even excluding car prices (which were heavily impacted by microchip shortages), inflation remains high at 6.6%, nearing 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>. This situation, where the economy is slowing down with inflation near 9%, is unprecedented in history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>, forcing the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] to act, potentially accelerating an economic slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>.

## Influence on the Federal Reserve

There is a select finance club in New York, sponsored by the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Federal Reserve]] Bank of New York, which provides informal advice to [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] members <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:25">[00:03:25]</a>. This committee, though independent, includes influential figures like [[ray_dalio_and_stanley_druckenmillers_views_on_the_dollar | Ray Dalio]] and [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Bill Ackman]], as well as other investment fund managers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. These individuals articulate their visions in conferences, influencing the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Federal Reserve]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>.

## Ackman's Recommendations for the Fed

[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Bill Ackman]]'s recommendations to [[federal_reserves_secret_meeting_and_its_impact_on_monetary_policy | Fed]] officials include:
*   Keeping the **neutral interest rate significantly higher** than the expected 2.75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Accelerating the contraction of the Fed's balance sheet** (reducing the money supply printed during crises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>.
*   **Raising interest rates more aggressively**, including multiple 0.5% increases, and potentially even 0.75% or 1% increases in upcoming meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>.

## Ackman's Rationale: Why Aggressive Action is Good

[[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Bill Ackman]] holds a view contrary to common market sentiment: he believes that aggressive rate hikes, if decisive, will ultimately lead to a strong market recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a>.

His reasoning is as follows:
*   **Preventing Permanent Inflation**: If the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] does not act decisively, inflation could become permanent and ingrained in the economy, similar to situations seen in Argentina, Venezuela, or Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. The market, particularly the bond market, fears this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:01">[01:10:01]</a>.
*   **Market-Induced Recession**: If the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] doesn't do its job, the market will. Significant stock market falls lead to losses, causing a recession in the real economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>. The current market declines are evidence of this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.
*   **Two Paths to Stopping Decline**: The only ways to halt the current economic decline are either through aggressive rate increases by the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] or an economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
*   **Market Confidence**: If the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] raises rates faster than expected and "nips the problem at the root," it will instil confidence that inflation will not become entrenched, thus ensuring long-term economic prosperity with low inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>. This decisive action, while potentially causing a short-term recession, would lead to a long-term benefit of not needing constantly high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:11">[01:29:11]</a>.
*   **Long-Duration Assets**: Historically, low interest rates favor long-duration assets like stocks, especially technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:36">[01:10:36]</a>. When [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | central banks]] act early, they aim for a predictable inflation environment (2-3%), which can cause initial market distortions but ultimately benefits equity markets in the long term by nipping inflation at the root <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. [[bill_ackmans_investment_strategy | Ackman]] argues that if the [[federal_reserves_position_on_market_intervention | Fed]] acts decisively, the market will gain confidence that inflation won't become structural, like in hyperinflationary economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:56">[01:11:56]</a>. This decisive action acts like applying a "band-aid now to avoid a bigger wound in the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:01">[01:13:01]</a>.

The global economy has recently experienced a significant downturn, marked by events such as "Black Monday" on March 9th, with stock market falls comparable to the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This period has also seen oil prices suffer their largest fall in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. These events, combined with a widespread "problem that we all know," have led some media outlets to predict a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>.

## Characteristics of Affected Companies and Sectors

The current crisis is largely a consumer crisis, with 70% of the economy based on consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. If people are confined to their homes, the consequences for consumption-driven businesses can be severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

Companies that have been most impacted in the stock market are those that:
*   Had significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   Have high fixed costs in their businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.
*   Are very sensitive to the economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   Are cyclical raw material companies, due to the dual difficulty of predicting raw material prices and company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>.

## Specific Affected Sectors and Companies

Several sectors and specific companies have been particularly hit:

*   **Aviation, Cruises, and Tourism**
    *   Air traffic and world tourism have come to a complete halt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
    *   Companies directly related to these sectors include hotel companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
    *   Examples of significant declines include:
        *   Norwegian Air SAD: fallen more than 75% in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.
        *   American Airlines: fallen more than 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.
        *   Cruise companies: fallen 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.
    *   **Aena**: This Spanish company holds a monopoly over Spanish airport management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. Its shares fell from 200 euros to around 100 euros due to the current problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.
    *   **Autogrill**: An Italian company that manages restaurants in airports and highways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Its shares fell from ten euros to five euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>, partly due to being listed on the Italian stock exchange and its direct relation to the airline sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>.
    *   **Amadeus**: A Spanish company with a monopoly on the IT infrastructure for flight sales and reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:10">[00:14:10]</a>. Its shares, which had risen to 70 euros, fell vertically to just over 40 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

*   **Oil Sector**
    *   Oil prices collapsed by close to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:50">[00:00:50]</a>, triggered by Saudi Arabia's decision to increase production after Russia refused to cut it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
    *   Stocks in the oil sector have fallen very significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.
    *   This collapse is seen as negative because it will cause bankruptcies among the weakest companies in the sector, especially as producing oil below 40 dollars is unprofitable in many regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>.
    *   Many of these companies already have debt, leading to concerns about instability in the financial sector due to banks' exposure to their debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

## Government and Central Bank Response

Governments and central banks, learning from the 2008 crisis, have recognized the need to inject liquidity into the economy and rescue troubled companies to prevent a chain reaction of bankruptcies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. The Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB) are injecting significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Governments are offering aid; for example, the Norwegian government declared it would not let its airlines fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>, and the American government pledged to help the tourism industry, airlines, and cruises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

## Investment Considerations for Affected Companies

For investors, it is crucial not to panic and avoid selling at the worst possible moment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. Reviewing portfolios for companies with debt risk is advised, specifically checking for debt maturities in the near future (three to six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Companies with access to liquidity, such as cash or credit lines, are better positioned to meet debt repayments even if they don't generate profits for a few months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>.

[[Investment strategies during economic downturns | Warren Buffett]]'s [[investing_strategies_for_economic_downturns | investment strategy]] during such crises is to invest in directly affected companies that possess higher quality or better solvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. He exemplified this by purchasing shares of Delta Airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>, a company known for one of the most solid balance sheets in the airline industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Similarly, in the 2008 crisis, he invested in Bank of America, a well-positioned bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>.

While the market experiences volatility, it is important to remember that the stock market has historically survived numerous challenges, including world wars, hyperinflation, deflation, and financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:04">[00:15:04]</a>. The collapse in oil prices, despite initial negative market reaction, ultimately benefits most Western economies by providing consumers with greater disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. As JP Morgan famously stated, "in bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:18">[00:15:18]</a>.

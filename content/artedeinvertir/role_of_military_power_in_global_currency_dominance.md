The status of a world reserve currency is intricately linked to military supremacy, a historical pattern observed across different eras <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:44">[07:43:44]</a>. This military strength guarantees the security and prosperity of an economy and its currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:50:50">[07:50:50]</a>.

## Historical Precedent

Throughout history, countries whose currencies held the status of world reserve currency have consistently possessed military superiority:
*   **Spain (1500-1700)** The Spanish currency was the world reserve during a period of Spanish military dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:48">[07:54:48]</a>.
*   **United Kingdom (1800-1900)** The British pound gained prominence as the world reserve currency due to the UK's military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:53">[08:00:53]</a>.
*   **United States (Last 100 years)** The US dollar's status as the undisputed international king for the past century is tied to its army's military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:55">[08:06:55]</a>.

## Current US Military Hegemony

The United States maintains global leadership in many aspects, with a key factor being its military prowess, symbolized by assets like the F-22 Raptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:43">[07:33:43]</a>. This military strength provides the dollar with its global hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:23">[07:38:23]</a>. The US military's power is no longer solely measured by troop numbers but by key elements that confer military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:24">[08:51:24]</a>.

Key US military assets and their manufacturers include:
*   **Lockheed Martin** Manufactures the F-22 Raptor (exclusively for the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:32">[09:05:32]</a> and the F-35 (sold to the US and G7 allies) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:02">[09:12:02]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics** Manufactures advanced nuclear submarines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:07">[09:19:07]</a>.
*   **Northrop Grumman** Known for the B2 spy bomber <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:44">[09:23:44]</a>.
*   **Raytheon Technologies** Specializes in long-range Tomahawk missiles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:02">[09:30:02]</a>.

These companies have seen formidable stock market results due to high demand from G7 governments, manufacturing critical elements for maintaining military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:35:10">[09:35:10]</a>. They are often insulated from traditional economic crises, as defense spending budgets tend to be linear and constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:52:16">[09:52:16]</a>.

## China's Challenge to Dollar Dominance

[[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China]], leading the [[impact_of_brics_alliance_on_global_currency_dynamics | BRICS alliance]], seeks to end the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China]] is keenly aware of the link between military power and currency status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:47">[08:11:47]</a>. This understanding explains [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China's]] significant investments in its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:14:49">[08:14:49]</a>.

Military spending trends:
*   [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China's]] military spending is rapidly approaching that of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
*   It is estimated that within five years, [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China's]] annual military expenditure will surpass $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:31">[08:25:31]</a>.

This increased investment by [[chinas_strategy_to_challenge_the_us_dollar | China]] will likely compel the United States to increase its own defense spending to maintain its hegemony, benefiting private government contractors in the defense sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:54">[08:38:54]</a>. This dynamic suggests continued strong performance for defense-related stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:31:36">[08:31:36]</a>.

[[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett]], often referred to as the greatest investor of all time and nicknamed "The Oracle of Omaha" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>, manages a portfolio of listed shares valued at over $240 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. After several months of caution, where he had been selling shares, he has regained confidence and is making significant purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Tracking Warren Buffett's Investments

The stock market transparency rules in the US mandate that [[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett]] periodically declares his stock purchases, sales, and main investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This is because the American regulator (SEC) forces large investors or institutions with over $100 million in investments to declare their holdings quarterly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

There are two primary ways to access this information:
*   **Official Way**: Directly on the SEC website, searching for Berkshire Hathaway (the holding company through which [[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett]] invests) and locating document 13FE <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. This document, however, can be difficult to understand for new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Processed Websites**: Utilizing websites like WayWisdom.com, which process and present this information in a more understandable format <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## Recent Investment Moves

Based on WayWisdom.com, [[warren_buffetts_latest investment moves|Warren Buffett]] has significantly reduced his investments in American banks such as Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and PNC Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This suggests he is not optimistic about the banking sector for 2021, though he maintains a substantial investment in one American bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

Conversely, his recent purchases have focused primarily on pharmaceutical companies like Bristol Myers, Merck, and AbbVie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. These new investments exemplify his characteristic approach: waiting for good companies with predictable, increasing income to trade at attractive valuations due to temporary issues or market oversight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. The pharmaceutical sector, previously under pressure from regulatory threats during the Trump administration, became attractive after the defeat of Donald Trump and the new democratic administration's plan to invest heavily in health <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

A notable [[warren_buffetts_recent stock acquisitions|recent stock acquisition]] includes a purchase of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway, for over $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>. This buyback strategy is driven by his belief that Berkshire Hathaway shares are trading below their real value, and by reducing outstanding shares, he increases the value for remaining shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. Historically, aggressive buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway shares have led to good performance on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Portfolio for 2021: Major Investments

[[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett's]] portfolio for 2021 is heavily concentrated, with his top six investments representing 80% of its total value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.

### 1. Apple (AAPL)
Apple shares constitute 47% of [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|his current portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $109 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett]] first invested in Apple in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:06">[00:12:06]</a>. This move resembled his recent pharmaceutical investments, as Apple, a high-quality company with good market position, was not fully appreciated by investors due to concerns about its growth potential given its large size <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He invested an impressive $20 billion when the stock was trading at only $25 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Since then, the shares have multiplied fivefold, generating over $80 trillion in profit for him and his shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>. While Apple's current valuation of 30 times earnings is demanding, it is considered justified for a company of its quality with future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.

### 2. Bank of America (BAC)
Bank of America represents over 10% of [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|his portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $24 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>. As one of the four major American banks, it controls an oligopoly in the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:19">[00:13:19]</a>. Despite recently reducing his exposure to other American banks like Wells Fargo and J.P. Morgan, [[warren_buffetts_investment principles|he maintains a high conviction]] about Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment principles|Warren Buffett]] has stated he is comfortable with the banks in his portfolio, finding them attractive compared to other market shares. He believes banking is a good business if "you don't do absurd things with the assets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. The banks in his portfolio earn between 12% and 16% on their tangible book value, which is favorable compared to a 30-year bond yielding only 2% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:08">[00:14:08]</a>. Bank of America shares are currently trading below their historical average at just 12 times earnings, making it an attractive valuation with good future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

### 3. Coca-Cola (KO)
Coca-Cola accounts for over 8% of [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|his portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $19 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment strategy and secret stock purchase|His investment in Coca-Cola]] is another example of buying a good company experiencing a temporary, solvable problem, similar to his Apple investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>. More than 20 years ago, the "New Coke" launch was a fiasco, leading to a decline in sales and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>. During this period of uncertainty, [[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett]] reinvested in the company, which had good long-term prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:20">[00:15:20]</a>. Since his initial investment, Coca-Cola shares have multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:29">[00:15:29]</a>. His confidence is so high that he has publicly declared he will never sell a share of Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Coca-Cola shares currently trade at a valuation of 25 times their historical average earnings, justified by the business's quality and growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. These shares are ideal for conservative investors due to low debt and crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

### 4. American Express (AXP)
American Express accounts for over 6% of [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|his portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:21">[00:16:21]</a>. It is characterized by high profit margins, a high return on invested capital, and good future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. It operates in an oligopoly dominated by Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:49">[00:16:49]</a>. American Express is trading at an attractive valuation; it is estimated to earn over $10 in earnings per share in the next 35 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. Historically, it has traded at over 20 times earnings, suggesting a potential target price above $200 per share in five years, which would mean doubling his money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This aligns with [[warren_buffetts_investment principles|Warren Buffett's minimum target return]] of over 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>.

### 5. Kraft Heinz (KHC)
Kraft Heinz represents over 4% of [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|his portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:48">[00:17:48]</a>. This is one of the few investments where [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|Warren Buffett]] has suffered losses, having invested over five years ago at $80 per share, which has since dropped over 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. [[warren_buffetts_investment advice|Warren Buffett]] has publicly stated that his main mistake was paying a very high price based on the company's production capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:19">[00:18:19]</a>. This highlights a crucial [[warren_buffetts_investment advice|investment lesson]]: no matter how good a company is, one cannot invest at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Kraft Heinz also faces challenges with high debt and declining popularity of its products due to new healthier eating trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>. However, [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|Warren Buffett]] maintains his position, likely because the company is now trading at a more attractive valuation. Using the EV/EBITDA ratio (which accounts for debt), Kraft Heinz is currently trading below its historical average of 14 times EBITDA, at around 10 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. With reduced debt and stabilized revenue, it could return to its historical average, implying a target value of $50 per share from its current $32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

### 6. Moody's (MCO)
Moody's accounts for over 3% of [[warren_buffetts_current investment moves|his portfolio]], with an investment exceeding $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:19">[00:20:19]</a>. Moody's represents the ideal investment type for [[warren_buffetts_investment strategies and insights|Warren Buffett]]: a company with a dominant market position, little affected by crises, high profit margins, and predictable earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It controls the oligopoly of debt rating agencies alongside Standard & Poor's and Fitch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. These companies can raise prices annually due to a lack of competition in an unregulated sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:07">[00:21:07]</a>. Moody's has historically traded around 25 times earnings, its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. With a 15% annual earnings per share growth rate over the last five years, Moody's could reach $20 per share in 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Multiplied by its historical 25 times valuation, this suggests a target price of $500 per share from its current $270, representing a 100% return or 15% average annual compound return, aligning with [[warren_buffetts_investment principles|Warren Buffett's investment goals]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:48">[00:21:48]</a>.

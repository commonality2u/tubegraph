One common question for investors is how the collection of dividends works, particularly concerning tax payments [00:08:02].

## General Dividend Taxation

In most countries, dividends are typically taxed at a rate between 20% and 25% [00:17:25].

## International Dividend Taxation (Withholding Tax)

A significant issue arises when receiving dividends from outside your country of tax residence [00:17:31]. This scenario often involves a "withholding tax" (or "wheat holding tax"), which can result in a double payment of taxes [00:17:35].

> [!CAUTION]
> Recovering this double taxation can be a complex and bureaucratic process in many countries [00:17:40].

## Reducing Double Taxation

For dividends received from the United States, a specific form, the W8BN form, can help avoid this double taxation [00:17:48]. Many reputable brokers, such as Interactive Brokers, offer an easy way to fill out this form with a simple click [00:17:53]. This process helps ensure that the dividends received in your account do not incur that capital loss due to double taxation [00:17:59].

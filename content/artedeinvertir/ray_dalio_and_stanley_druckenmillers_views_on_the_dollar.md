The U.S. dollar, considered the global foreign exchange reserve, is beginning its decline, a process that central bank and government decisions are expected to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. What happens to the dollar significantly affects economies and stock markets worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. Since the onset of a recent crisis, the dollar has devalued more than 10% against the Euro in just nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. This devaluation is despite the fact that Europe is also creating a substantial amount of new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>.

Currently, 62% of all the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars, and factoring in dollarized economies, the real percentage could exceed 70% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. A striking fact is that in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Since the Bretton Woods Agreement in the early 1970s, the Federal Reserve has had the power to print as many dollars as it wishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Historically, this tool was used cautiously, as drastically increasing the supply of new dollars can lead to a fall in currency value, increased inflation, and economic collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>. However, 2020 marked a shift, with the amount of new dollars in circulation getting "out of control" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>.

Adding to concerns, Federal Reserve President Jerome Powell declared they would be comfortable with a higher level of inflation, indicating an intention to increase the money supply and further devalue the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Historically, such monetary experiments have not worked, with examples like the Roman Empire, Germany in the early 20th century, Venezuela, and Zimbabwe experiencing disastrous economic consequences due to aggressive currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | Ray Dalio]]'s Perspective

[[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | Ray Dalio]], often called the "Steve Jobs of financial markets" for his ability to foresee economic events, manages Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

In a recent Bloomberg interview, [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | Dalio]] warned that the dollar's value could decrease and it might cease to be the world's primary foreign currency reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>. To protect against this, [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] is investing in:
*   Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>
*   Inflation-protected bonds (TIPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>
*   Stocks outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>

Specifically, his most recent portfolio showed an investment of $200 million in an ETF for emerging markets, which focuses on stocks from countries outside the U.S. that are less indebted and do not need to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

## [[stanley_druckenmillers_economic_predictions | Stanley Druckenmiller]]'s Perspective

Legendary investor [[stanley_druckenmillers_economic_predictions | Stanley Druckenmiller]], known for average annual returns over 30% for more than three decades without any annual losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, also warned about the dollar's future. In a CNN interview, he stated he is "aggressively selling dollars" and has a high conviction that the currency's value will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.

[[stanley_druckenmillers_economic_predictions | Druckenmiller]] noted that the Federal Reserve's union with the Treasury, occurring during the crisis, sets a precedent unseen since the Federal Reserve's independence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. He predicts increased inflation over the next five or six years due to this dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>.

To counter these effects, [[stanley_druckenmillers_economic_predictions | Druckenmiller]] is:
*   Investing in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>
*   Selling dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>
*   Buying mining companies expected to benefit from future inflation increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>

## Protecting Capital and Savings

Even for those outside the U.S. without dollars, this economic phenomenon is likely to have an impact, as other central banks and economies are replicating the U.S.'s actions, increasing the amount of new Euros, Yen, or Pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. Money held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to inflation, and fixed-income investments or bonds will also be negatively affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

The video outlines five ways to protect capital and savings from this accelerated devaluation:

### 1. Sell Dollars
This strategy, used by [[stanley_druckenmillers_economic_predictions | Druckenmiller]], involves operating in the forex market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. While the dollar may devalue, it's important to consider the performance of the paired currency (e.g., Euro or Pound) as other major currencies are also being printed in significant amounts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

### 2. Invest in Gold
Gold acts like a currency but cannot be created out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. The price of gold is denominated in dollars, meaning if the dollar's value falls due to increased circulation, the price of gold tends to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Investors can buy physical gold through ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) to avoid storage and security costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>. Examples include the iShares Physical Gold ETF (EGLN) on the London Stock Exchange and the SPDR Gold Shares ETF (GLD) in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>.

### 3. Invest in Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)
As [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | Ray Dalio]] suggests, TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) appreciate in value as inflation increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>. The iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP) in the U.S. is a way to invest in these bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>. This ETF appreciated over 10% in the first part of 2020 due to dollar devaluation and high inflation expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.

### 4. Invest in Stocks Outside the U.S.
Investing in U.S.-denominated stocks might negate gains from share appreciation if the dollar devalues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_prediction_and_its_impact_on_the_global_economy | Ray Dalio]] utilizes this channel, investing in emerging markets ETFs that hold stocks from countries less reliant on printing currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. An example is the iShares Core MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (IEMG) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### 5. Invest in Large U.S. Exporting Companies
These companies benefit because they sell products abroad, theoretically receiving more valuable foreign currency, while their costs remain denominated in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This process automatically increases their income and earnings per share during devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.

*   **Rolls Royce (UK example):** After the pound plummeted by over 10% following Brexit in 2016, Rolls Royce, a UK company that manufactures locally but exports globally, appreciated by more than 30% in a few weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline (UK example):** Similarly, this pharmaceutical exporter saw its stock rise by over 20% immediately after the pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.

**U.S. Examples:**

*   **ExxonMobil (XOM):** As the world's largest oil company, ExxonMobil benefits from both raw material production (oil prices tend to rise when the dollar falls) and significant exports (over half its products are sold outside the U.S.) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. Its stock price dropped due to current low oil prices, but it's expected to recover as oil returns to historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Historically, ExxonMobil has traded at 15 times earnings, suggesting a target value of $60 per share based on normal oil levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Valuing based on its historical 4% dividend yield suggests a target of $75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.
*   **Pfizer (PFE):** A leading biotechnology company, Pfizer exports over 50% of its sales outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a>. The company has strong returns on equity (ROEs) consistently above 20% and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>. With expected earnings of around $3 per share and a historical sector valuation of 18 times earnings, Pfizer's target value for the next year is $54 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. [[bill_ackmans_views_on_federal_reserve_policies | Warren Buffett]] has also invested over $135 million in Pfizer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

Other large U.S. exporting companies that could perform well in this environment include Apple, Facebook, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

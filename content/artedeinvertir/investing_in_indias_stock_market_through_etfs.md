Ray Dalio, one of the world's most successful investors and fund managers, often described as the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:20">[01:18:20]</a>, has recently shown interest in the Indian stock market through an Exchange Traded Fund (ETF) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:53">[00:09:53]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment in India
Ray Dalio's firm recently purchased an ETF that replicates the performance of the Indian [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. This particular ETF, listed in the US under the ticker YND, trades at approximately $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

### Why India?
As a "macro investor" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>, Ray Dalio not only selects individual stocks but also invests in broader [[investment_strategies for_stocks_and_bonds | investment themes]], such as gold, bonds, or the economies of specific countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. ETFs enable him to execute this thematic [[investment_strategies for_stocks_and_bonds | investment strategy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>.

There are two primary reasons for his interest in India:

1.  **Market Accessibility**
    India is considered a very closed market, with limited openness to foreign investors. This makes it challenging to open a securities account and select individual companies directly in the country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>. Investing through an ETF offers an easier way to gain exposure to the Indian market without significant bureaucratic complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>.

2.  **Economic Prospects**
    India is identified as one of the countries with the best economic prospects for the next decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. Many analysts suggest it could achieve similar success to what China has experienced in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>.

    India's impressive economic growth rate has surpassed 7% per year, outperforming China and the average 3% growth of other economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. The nation possesses several key ingredients to become a world power in the coming decades, including <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>:
    *   A young population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>
    *   Pro-capitalist reforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>
    *   Cheap labor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>
    *   Low national debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>
    *   Its proximity to major global powers like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>

### Potential Returns
While estimating the future performance of an ETF is more complex than individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, if we consider the US [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]]'s historical average annual return of 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>, India's greater growth and promising outlook suggest it could yield returns higher than 8% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>.

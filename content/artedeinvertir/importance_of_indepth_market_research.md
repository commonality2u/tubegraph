[[importance_of_analyzing_stock_market_and_investment_opportunities | In-depth market research]] is crucial for investors, particularly those starting with smaller capital, as it enables the discovery of undervalued companies and the potential for extraordinary returns. Warren Buffett has consistently emphasized that a limited amount of capital can be a significant advantage, allowing for higher percentage returns [00:00:19].

## Warren Buffett's Perspective on Small Capital

Warren Buffett stated in 1999 that he believed he could achieve a 50% annual return if he managed less than a million dollars [00:00:22]. This contrasts sharply with his current returns, which have decreased from 50% to around 10% annually due to his fortune of 80 billion dollars [00:01:06]. With large amounts of capital, finding suitable investment opportunities becomes challenging, as investing 100 trillion dollars offers fewer alternatives than investing ten thousand dollars [00:01:34].

To achieve high returns with small capital, Buffett advises:
*   **Expanding Your Universe** The investment universe expands significantly when dealing with smaller sums, offering "thousands of possibilities" [00:01:30].
*   **Searching for Anomalies** Investors must "move a lot of rocks" to find anomalies [00:01:38]. These often involve companies that are "off the map," including small, local businesses [00:01:40].
*   **Example: Western Insurance** Buffett cited finding Western Insurance, which was trading at three dollars a share but earning twenty dollars a share [00:01:49]. He sought to buy as much as possible, noting that such opportunities are not typically advertised; "you have to find them" [00:01:57].

## Key Takeaways for Market Research

Two significant lessons emerge from Buffett's insights [00:02:03]:

1.  **Invest Time and Effort** Investors must dedicate time and effort to actively search for opportunities, as they will not simply appear on their own [00:02:07]. Diligent research, such as analyzing five companies, can lead to finding exceptional investments [00:02:13].
2.  **Focus on Small-Cap Companies** The ideal area for research is in small companies, often known as "small caps" [00:02:21].
    *   Out of over 30,000 listed companies in the US, only about 500 are in the Standard and Poor's index [00:02:24]. These larger, well-analyzed companies typically offer annual returns below 15% [00:02:37].
    *   The remaining 29,500 companies are where investors are likely to find "local businesses" that are not globalized or international, often overlooked by larger investors [00:02:43].

### Real-Life Example: Humanice

A real-life example demonstrates the effectiveness of this approach. The True fund, when managing only 9 million euros, invested in Humanice [00:03:05].
*   **Company Profile** Humanice was a micro-company with a capitalization of just 30 million euros, barely followed by analysts and off the radar of many investors [00:03:16]. It was a sound business with low debt, simply ignored by the market [00:03:22].
*   **Valuation** Humanice was trading at one euro fifty per share, with projected earnings of one euro per share for the following year, resulting in a P/E (price-to-earnings) ratio of less than two times [00:03:31].
*   **Investment Strategy** Following Buffett's advice to "buy as much as possible" [00:03:45], the fund bought Humanice shares daily for four months, accumulating a position of approximately one million euros at 1.50 euros per share [00:03:48].
*   **Result** Three years later, those shares were trading at 6 euros per share, quadrupling the purchase price and generating significant profit [00:04:01].

## The [[importance_of_knowledge_in_investing | Importance of Knowledge and Preparation]]

When asked about advising a young Warren Buffett today, Buffett responded by saying he would do "exactly the same thing that I did 40 years ago, which is to learn as much as possible about all kinds of American stocks" [00:04:37].

> "In the stock market, luck does not exist; it is simply the combination of opportunity and preparation" [00:05:07].

Without preparation, one cannot identify or seize opportunities as they arise [00:05:13].

### How to Conduct Research

Historically, Buffett used "Moody's manuals," thick books containing detailed information on listed companies, allowing him to investigate shares and build mental models of different industries [00:05:28].

Today, similar information is freely available on platforms like Yahoo Finance and Morningstar.com, providing access to historical sales, profits, shares in circulation, and ownership details [00:06:12]. The advice remains to "investigate, learn and scan the market" [00:06:29].

The Humanice investment was successful not only because the investor was prepared and knew the sector but also because enough time was dedicated to seeking opportunities within small or lesser-known companies in that sector [00:06:35].

### Modern Tools and Strategy

Today, "screens" — computer tools — can scan the entire stock market, allowing investors to filter stocks by parameters like a low P/E, specific growth rates, or profit margins [00:07:04].

For beginners, it's advisable not to feel overwhelmed [00:07:20].
1.  **Choose an Industry:** Select an attractive industry, such as health, IT, technology, or transportation [00:07:22].
2.  **Learn the Sector:** Study the chosen sector thoroughly, starting with reports from larger companies, as they often provide the most detailed information on how the sector functions [00:07:28].
3.  **Identify Smaller Companies:** Once a foundational knowledge is established, look for smaller companies within that sector to find undervalued opportunities [00:07:41].

### Why the Strategy Remains Viable

This style of investing remains viable because successful investors in small companies often accumulate large capital, which then limits their ability to invest in these same small companies due to liquidity issues [00:07:56]. There are typically not enough shares in circulation to invest large sums, thus preserving these opportunities for investors with smaller capital [00:08:14].

## The [[the_importance_of_understanding_stock_valuation | Importance of Low P/E Ratio]]

Paying a low P/E ratio for investments is essential for generating extraordinary returns [00:08:20].
*   A stock trading at ten dollars and earning one dollar per share has a P/E of ten, suggesting an estimated return of around 10% [00:08:23].
*   However, finding a stock earning one dollar per share but trading at two dollars results in a P/E of two, potentially yielding a 50% annual return [00:08:34].

Therefore, focus on investments that are "very, very cheap" to generate these extraordinary returns [00:08:53].

### Warren Buffett's Korean Stocks Example

Around 2004, Buffett received a book on Korean stocks [00:08:59]. Despite initially joking about its cost, he spent five or six hours scanning it for cheap stocks [00:09:07]. He found interesting opportunities and invested 100 million dollars across 20 Korean stocks [00:09:14].

*   **Daehan Flour** One example was Daehan Flour, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea [00:09:26]. Its earnings per share had been significant, and it held substantial investments [00:09:34].
*   **Valuation and Returns** The stock was trading at 38,000 won [00:09:45]. Buffett emphasized that "you have to make money buying stocks like this at twice the profits" [00:09:51]. He made a very good return, as the stock quickly appreciated to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his investment by six times [00:09:57].

These situations have always existed in markets and will continue to exist [00:10:10]. Success requires illusion, passion, curiosity, hard work, and the willingness to do things differently from other investors [00:10:25].

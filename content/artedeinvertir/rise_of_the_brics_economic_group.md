The U.S. dollar, currently regarded as the world's most important currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>, has begun its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This shift is primarily driven by an alliance led by [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] and the BRICS countries, which aims to end the dollar's dominance as the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This impending change is expected to impact currency values, savings, investments, inflation, and the cost of living globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

Prominent investors like Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmiller have warned about the dollar's future loss of value and have begun selling their dollar holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## The Dollar's Global Privilege

The dollar's status grants the United States significant privileges, which it is now at risk of losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This loss would consequently affect other currencies linked to the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>. [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] recognizes the immense power derived from having the world's leading currency and seeks to dismantle this status to achieve its goal of becoming the greatest economic power globally within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>.

Historically, global power was concentrated in the G7, comprising the United States, Canada, United Kingdom, major European countries, and Japan (formerly G8 with Russia, which was recently expelled) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>.

### The Rise of BRICS as a Counterbalance

A new power bloc, BRICS, has emerged to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. The acronym stands for Brazil, Russia, India, [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]], and South Africa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. The BRICS group holds a strong chance of success, representing 43% of the world's population, significantly more than the G7's 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. An increasing number of countries are joining BRICS to escape the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.

The BRICS alliance no longer conceals its intentions to move away from the dollar's power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. Brazil's President Lula da Silva stated his objective to end dollar dominance, and Brazil is often seen as a spokesperson for [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]]'s views <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>. This shift is anticipated to cause a significant [[economic_impact_of_the_new_world_order | economic earthquake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

Currently, 62% of the world's money is represented in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Other G7 currencies like the Euro, Pound, and Yen, though powerful, are considered "franchises" of the American dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

### The Advantages of a Reserve Currency

Holding the world's reserve currency offers two main advantages:
1.  **Ability to Print Money with Minimal Inflation:** The United States can print large quantities of new dollars without significant inflation due to constant international demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:04">[00:03:04]</a>. The value of currencies is determined by supply and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. For the past 50 years, the US has resolved economic problems by printing more dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:18">[00:03:18]</a>. For instance, 23% of total dollars in circulation were printed in a single year during the 2020 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. While this caused some inflation, it was minor compared to countries like Argentina, which experienced 60% annual inflation after printing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. The Federal Reserve's balance sheet grew by over 120% in less than 1.5 years during 2020, yet inflation remained at 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.
2.  **Lower Financing Costs:** The dollar's status allows the US and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>. This creates a competitive advantage for their economies to prosper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This creates a virtuous cycle where a stronger currency attracts more lending at cheaper rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>.

## BRICS Strategy to End Dollar Dominance

At the BRICS Summit in 2022, a roadmap was established to end the dollar's dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] is expected to be the primary beneficiary of this change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. The Chinese Renminbi (Yuan) is gaining market share; since the beginning of the Russia-Ukraine conflict, its international market share has doubled from 2% to 4%, approaching that of the Euro, the second most important currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. The dollar's value on the stock market has also sharply declined, plummeting over 13% in less than 9 months since this roadmap's design <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

The BRICS alliance proposes to trade within its territory using its own currencies, excluding the dollar. This would increase the value and international demand for their currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

### Military Supremacy and Economic Hegemony

A key factor in a currency's global hegemony is military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>. Historically, reserve currencies have been associated with military power that guarantees economic security and currency prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:43">[00:07:43]</a>. Examples include:
*   **Spain (1500-1700):** Its currency was the world reserve due to military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>.
*   **British Pound (1800-1900):** Dominated thanks to military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.
*   **US Dollar (Last 100 years):** Its army makes it the undisputed king <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

[[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] is well aware of this and is investing heavily in its military capabilities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>. Chinese military spending is rapidly approaching that of the United States and is projected to surpass it within five years, with annual expenditures exceeding $500 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>. This increased spending by [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] will likely force the US to increase its own defense spending to maintain hegemony, benefiting private government contractors in the defense sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>.

Companies like Lockheed Martin (F-22 Raptor, F-35), General Dynamics (nuclear submarines), Northrop Grumman (B-2 stealth bomber), and Raytheon (Tomahawk missiles) are key players that benefit from maintaining military supremacy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:59">[00:08:59]</a>. These companies have shown strong stock market performance and are insulated from traditional economic crises as defense budgets tend to be constant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. They project growth rates above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

### BRICS Free Trade Area

[[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]]'s second strategy is to establish a large, tax-free free trade area among BRICS countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. Over 60% of the world's population is projected to join this macro-area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. In contrast, the United States and its G7 allies operate more slowly and bureaucratically; their attempt to launch a similar Trans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) failed due to internal struggles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a>.

## Investment Strategies in a Changing Global Economy

Ray Dalio, a prominent investment fund manager, noted in his book *The New World Order* (likely referring to *The Changing World Order*) how [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] is in a phase of ascent while the US is in decline, which will lead to the dollar's end <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. Dalio advises investors to protect against the dollar's fall by investing in gold, which he considers the purest form of money that cannot be printed and protects against currency depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>. Gold has appreciated by 9% annually over the last 20 years, even when measured against major currencies, with low volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

### Ways to Invest in Gold:
1.  **Physical Gold:** Disadvantages include security and storage costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:38">[00:12:38]</a>.
2.  **Gold Mining Companies:** Can suffer from operational complexities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>.
3.  **Gold ETFs:** Ray Dalio's preferred method. Examples include the GLD (GoldShares ETF) at $182 per share (9.5% yield this year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:55">[00:12:55]</a>, and for European investors, the EGRN at €35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

Stanley Druckenmiller, known for impressive returns in currency and bond investments, also expressed no confidence in the Federal Reserve or Biden's actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. He suggests selling dollars and buying gold, anticipating that a fall in the dollar will cause increased inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>.

### Investing in Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS):
In an inflationary scenario, Druckenmiller finds US Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities (TIPS) interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. These bonds guarantee a return above inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>.
1.  **Direct Bond Purchase:** Can be complex for some investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
2.  **TIPS ETFs:** Easier way to invest. Examples include the Charles Schwab ETF on TIPS (ticker SCP, $54 per share, 6.5% annual yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>, and for Europe, BlackRock's ITPE (€5 per share), which offers a currency-hedged version to mitigate currency risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:10">[00:15:10]</a>.

In periods of inflation, traditional bonds not protected against inflation and holding cash are poor ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:02">[00:16:02]</a>. Real estate and stock market investments in shares have generally performed well during such times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:09">[00:16:09]</a>. Additionally, operating in the Forex market allows selling one currency against another, such as the American dollar against the Chinese Yuan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:17">[00:16:17]</a>.

### Stock Market Strategies to Benefit from Dollar Decline:

1.  **American Export Companies:** Invest in US companies listed in dollars that have significant export components to non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:40">[00:16:40]</a>. When these companies translate foreign currency profits into dollars, their profits increase, leading to stock appreciation and protection <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. An example is Brexit, where major UK exporting companies like Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline rose sharply as the pound and general stock market collapsed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>.
2.  **Companies with Exposure to the Chinese Economy:** Look for companies with high exports to [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] to benefit from its economic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:02">[00:18:02]</a>. Examples include high-quality companies like Wynn Resorts and Las Vegas Sands casinos, and technology/semiconductor companies such as Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:15">[00:18:15]</a>.
3.  **Luxury Sector Companies:** These companies often have currencies denominated in euros or dollars, and Chinese consumers are major buyers of luxury goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:29">[00:18:29]</a>. An economic boom in [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | China]] would increase sales, translating into higher profits in euros or dollars, providing real coverage against a dollar fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Companies like Louis Vuitton, Hermes, and Ferrari have consistently prospered in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

The [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | decline of the US economy and rise of China]] is a significant global shift with profound [[economic_impact_of_the_new_world_order | economic implications of the new world order]] that investors must consider.

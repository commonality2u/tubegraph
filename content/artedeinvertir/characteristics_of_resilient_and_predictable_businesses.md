Investors like Bill Ackman and Warren Buffett advocate for owning [[predictable_businesses_in_investment | predictable]] and resilient companies to navigate various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. Predicting the overall economy is complex due to numerous variables, but forecasting the performance of an individual publicly traded company is often much easier <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>.

## Key Characteristics

### 1. Predictable Earnings
These are businesses whose earnings can be reliably predicted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. They operate in sectors that are easy to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

*   **Consumer Staples**: People continue to purchase essential goods and services regardless of economic conditions. Examples include toothpaste, food, and entertainment subscriptions like Netflix or YouTube <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Franchise Models**: Companies like Domino's Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill are considered predictable because people will continue eating pizzas or burritos even if the economy worsens, as demonstrated during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. McDonald's, for instance, saw only a slight 3% drop in sales in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:47">[03:33:47]</a>.

### 2. Resistance to Crises
Resilient businesses are not significantly affected by economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

*   **Franchise and Royalty Models**: McDonald's, and similar companies like Restaurant Brands International (Burger King), benefit from inflation because they charge royalties and rents based on revenue. As menu prices increase, their income rises, while their property costs remain relatively stable, leading to expanded gross margins even during economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>. McDonald's gross margin expanded from 38% to 40% during the 2007-2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Home Improvement Retailers**: Companies like Lowe's are more resilient than they might appear. While new construction plummeted by 70% during the 2008 real estate crisis, Lowe's sales only decreased by 2%. This indicates that the majority (90-95%) of their business comes from recurring maintenance and renovation activities rather than new builds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   **Software Companies**: Businesses like Adobe, which offer essential software products (e.g., PDF editors, creative suites), demonstrate resilience. During the 2008-2010 period, Adobe's sales saw a slight dip in 2009 but overall operating profit increased significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:22">[01:19:22]</a>. Similarly, Oracle, a database management business, showed minimal decline during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:53">[01:36:53]</a>.
*   **Luxury Goods**: Companies like Louis Vuitton maintain strong demand even during economic fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
*   **Iconic Brands**: Businesses like See's Candies (a Berkshire Hathaway acquisition) are resilient as people continue to buy gifts for special occasions like birthdays and anniversaries, regardless of economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:36:00">[04:36:00]</a>.

### 3. Pricing Power
This is the ability of a company to raise prices for its products or services without losing customers, even when its costs increase due to factors like inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

*   **Strong Brands/Products**:
    *   **Chipotle Mexican Grill**: Can raise menu prices because it offers a good value proposition as a healthier fast-food option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Nike**: Historically, Nike has increased prices by 5% annually, even when their costs only rose by 2-3%. This differential flows directly to profit, demonstrating strong operating leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Visa/Mastercard**: These payment networks are accepted globally and offer convenience and security. If Visa raises its transaction fee slightly (e.g., from 0.25% to 0.27%), merchants are unlikely to stop accepting Visa, as a significant portion of their sales are via card <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
    *   **Adobe/Microsoft**: Customers are unlikely to cancel subscriptions for essential software like Adobe PDF editor or Microsoft Office (Word, Excel) even with price increases, as the cost is minuscule compared to the total company expenses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>. Microsoft announced a 20% price increase for Office products, expecting minimal customer loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:19">[01:20:19]</a>.
    *   **See's Candies**: People don't typically haggle over the price of a gift box of chocolates for a special occasion, prioritizing the expected value of the gift over a small price difference <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:00">[04:29:00]</a>.

*   **Absence of R&D dependency**: Some ideal businesses, like See's Candies, do not require significant ongoing investment in research and development, allowing for lower operational costs and greater stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:40:00">[04:40:00]</a>.

### 4. Low Debt and Growth Prospects
Ideally, these businesses should have little or no debt, protecting them from rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. They should also demonstrate continued growth, which justifies higher valuations.

*   **Chipotle**: With only 2,700 locations (compared to over 30,000 for McDonald's/Burger King globally) and a growing market for Mexican restaurants in the USA (45,000 in 2019, projected 50,000 by 2025), Chipotle has significant room for expansion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:10">[01:04:10]</a>.
*   **Adobe/Salesforce**: These cloud software companies benefit from the growing cloud computing sector (10-15% annual growth) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:54">[01:39:54]</a>.

## How to Identify Resilient and Predictable Businesses

1.  **Review Fundamentals During Crises**: Examine a company's financial data (revenue, profits) from periods like the 2008 financial crisis (2007-2010 annual reports). Strong performance during such times indicates resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
2.  **Analyze Long-Term Stock Market Behavior**: Look at a company's stock performance over 10-15 years. Consistent positive performance over a long period suggests a fundamentally sound business, as short-term fluctuations can be influenced by market euphoria or temporary issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.
3.  **Assess Pricing Power**: Consider how customers would react to a 10% price increase. If customers are likely to tolerate it without significant loss, the business possesses pricing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This is often linked to the product's necessity, brand loyalty, or lack of close alternatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>.

## Businesses to Avoid

*   **Commodity Businesses**: Companies dealing in commodities like steel (e.g., ArcelorMittal) have little competitive advantage and are highly sensitive to the economic cycle. During downturns, demand plummets, causing significant drops in sales and profit margins, even if raw material prices are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.
*   **Cyclical Businesses**: Industries like automotive (e.g., General Motors) face ruthless competition, resulting in lower prices for consumers but often poor investment returns for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>.
*   **Speculative Investments**: Companies that do not generate immediate cash flow or benefits, relying heavily on future projections, tend to perform poorly when interest rates rise or inflation appears, as investors prioritize current earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. Examples include electric vehicle companies, SPACs, renewable energy firms, and cloud software companies with high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

> [!CAUTION] Investing in companies with extremely high price-to-sales ratios (e.g., 40 times sales) or price-to-earnings ratios (e.g., 300 times earnings) is risky. While a few, like Amazon, have succeeded, many more fail. Diversifying a portfolio with such overvalued stocks does not mitigate risk; it merely creates a portfolio of overvalued assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

> [!TIP] Warren Buffett suggests buying [[investing_in_exceptional_businesses | exceptional businesses]] when they face temporary problems, as this often presents an opportunity to acquire them at a discount. Chipotle, for instance, experienced a significant stock drop due to a food crisis in 2016 but recovered strongly, multiplying its value by eight times in three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. Similarly, Volkswagen's stock became very cheap during the Dieselgate scandal, offering a buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:33">[01:00:33]</a>. This contrasts with [[comparison_of_investing_in_cyclical_versus_stable_companies | investing in cyclical versus stable companies]] directly.

## [[Strategies for achieving predictable returns through dividends | Investment Strategy]]

The overall strategy is to invest in businesses that are predictable and resilient, meaning they can thrive in nearly any economic condition. This approach prioritizes understanding the specific business over attempting to predict broad [[financial_market_dynamics_and_predictions | financial market dynamics and predictions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:00">[01:57:00]</a>. It's about [[understanding_competitive_advantages_in_business | understanding competitive advantages in business]] and their ability to generate consistent value over time.

Investors should aim to buy quality businesses at a reasonable price, as even excellent companies can be poor investments if overpaid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. This forms a winning formula for any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:55:00">[03:55:00]</a>.

> [!NOTE] [[technological_innovation_and_disruptive_companies | Technological innovation and disruptive companies]] like those in clean energy, electric vehicles, and cloud software experienced speculative bubbles due to easy money policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. However, as interest rates rise and inflation becomes a dominant force, these long-term projects without immediate cash flow are experiencing significant corrections, with many stocks seeing average drops of 50-70% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. This highlights the importance of focusing on cash flow generation in inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>. [[examples_of_businesses_that_perform_well_in_inflationary_periods | Examples of businesses that perform well in inflationary periods]] include those with strong pricing power and recurring revenue.

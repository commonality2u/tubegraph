Michael Burry, a renowned investor popularized by the movie *The Big Short*, has recently issued a significant warning about the stock market, stating that "the crisis has only just begun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. He has even specified a level he believes the stock market could reach before the crisis ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Burry's current stance reflects a deep-seated belief that the market is experiencing [[michael_burrys_stock_movements_and_market_predictions | bear market rallies]], not a true recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:19">[00:03:19]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Investment Background

[[Michael Burry and the 2008 financial crisis | Michael Burry]] gained fame for accurately predicting the dot-com bubble crisis, which he notes had many similarities to the current market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. He also successfully predicted and profited from the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>, demonstrating a consistent ability to navigate major market downturns. Even during the 2020 virus confinement, he capitalized on opportunities by buying cheap shares, including GameStop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Since his retirement from managing external funds, he has reportedly generated annual returns of over 20% in the last five years managing his own money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Market Outlook and Strategy Adjustments

Burry has reactivated his Twitter account, which was previously suspended due to concerns about market manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>. Through his tweets, he has emphasized his past warnings about impending inflation, rising rates, and bubbles in areas like high-growth stocks, cloud stocks, renewable energy, and cryptocurrenciesâ€”many of which have since materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

He argues that the current market is characterized by typical "bear market rallies," where the stock market temporarily bounces before continuing its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>. This behavior is dangerous, as many investors tend to buy during these rebounds, falsely believing the crisis is over <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Burry highlights that in major crises like 2000 and 1929, there were numerous false recovery attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>, leading many to lose liquidity or go into debt by buying into these rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### Price Target for the S&P 500

Based on his calculations, Burry anticipates that bear markets typically bottom out 13% to 17% below the previous crisis minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>. He estimates the S&P 500 could bottom out at a Price-to-Earnings (PER) ratio of 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>, a valuation point last seen in 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This would place the S&P 500 at 1,860 points, an additional 50% drop from current levels based on his valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Michael Burry's calculations are primarily based on valuation metrics like the PER ratio, which he believes will revert to historical lows seen in past crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Portfolio Changes

To adapt to this bearish scenario, [[michael_burrys_investment_strategies_and_portfolio_changes | Michael Burry's investment strategies]] involve two main adjustments:
1.  **Increasing Liquidity**: He has significantly reduced his declared holdings with the SEC. In Q3 2020, his portfolio had a declared value of $300 million, which peaked at $1.8 billion through derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>. In his latest report, he has only $75 million invested in long shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:13">[00:17:13]</a>, suggesting a substantial increase in cash reserves or short positions not required to be disclosed.
2.  **Concentrating on Defensive Stocks**: The few shares he holds are highly concentrated in very defensive sectors. His top three holdings constitute almost 75% of his minimal portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:53">[00:17:53]</a>.

### Specific Stock Picks

#### Bristol Myers (BMS)
Bristol Myers, a pharmaceutical company, is a significant holding in Burry's portfolio. The healthcare sector is known for its resilience during crises and its ability to pass on inflation due to the essential nature of its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:02">[00:43:02]</a>.

*   **Financials**: Bristol Myers reported strong latest results, with sales increasing by 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:16">[00:43:16]</a>.
*   **Shareholder Returns**: The company has an attractive shareholder treatment program, increasing dividends and buying back shares to boost earnings per share (EPS) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:25">[00:43:25]</a>. It generates $16 billion in cash flow annually, with only $1 billion reinvested, leaving $15 billion for distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:32">[00:45:32]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Bristol Myers is trading below its historical average valuation. Its current valuation is 9 times future earnings, compared to a historical average of 19 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:18">[00:46:18]</a>, and a five-year average of 14 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:20">[00:47:20]</a>.

#### General Dynamics (GD)
General Dynamics, a defense company, is another key holding. Its stock has performed well despite the overall market downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:22">[00:48:22]</a>.

*   **Divisions**: The company operates in four main divisions: aerospace (private jets), maritime defense systems (frigates, submarines), combat systems (tanks), and technology (electronic warfare systems) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:19">[00:49:19]</a>.
*   **Performance**: General Dynamics has shown modest growth expectations, with revenue remaining relatively flat over the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:31">[00:49:31]</a>. Its stock has doubled since 2020 lows, partly due to expectations of increased government defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:11">[00:50:11]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Defense companies like General Dynamics possess strong competitive advantages due to their specialized products that few others in the world can produce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:49">[00:53:49]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Despite its stable business, General Dynamics is currently trading at a higher valuation range of 10 to 19 times earnings, above its historical average of 15 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:47">[00:50:47]</a>.

## Broader Market Observations

Burry's actions align with observations by other investors:
*   **George Soros** highlighted that the most money is lost not by those who buy at the peak, but by those who buy repeatedly on the decline during bear markets, falsely believing the recovery has begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.
*   **Jim Chanos** points out that the current bubble is distinct from previous ones due to the "obscene levels" of market capitalization reached by many overvalued companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Warren Buffett** emphasizes that the 10-year bond yield acts as a "force of gravity" pulling down stock valuations when it rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:56">[00:30:56]</a>. This explains why overvalued stocks with high risk or no profits have fallen the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:06">[00:31:06]</a>.

> [!INFO] Current market volatility, with large daily swings, is often associated with market peaks rather than valleys <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:13">[01:13:13]</a>. True market bottoms are typically characterized by widespread fear and capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>, which are just starting to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:28">[02:42:28]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy in Bear Markets

The prevailing sentiment is that while the market is down, it presents opportunities for long-term investors. Historically, buying during significant market drops (15-30%) has proven to be a good decision, even if further drops occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:20">[01:50:20]</a>. The average bear market fall in the S&P 500 has been 30%, with recoveries typically taking about 1.5 years (excluding the deepest crises) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:02">[01:59:02]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The speaker advises against trying to time the market by selling during declines and waiting for a rebound, as this often leads to missed opportunities and compounding losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:00">[03:50:00]</a>.

It is crucial for investors to maintain a long-term perspective, focusing on the fundamentals of businesses rather than short-term price movements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:21">[03:19:21]</a>. Investing in companies with stable business models, low debt, and reasonable valuations is key to navigating turbulent markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:05">[01:03:05]</a>. The current market environment, with valuations returning to more reasonable levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:02">[02:54:02]</a>, is seen as an opportunity for those prepared to invest for the long haul.

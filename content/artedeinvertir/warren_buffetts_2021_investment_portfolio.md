[[Warren Buffett]], recognized as the greatest investor of all time, manages a portfolio of listed shares valued at over $240 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. After exercising caution and selling shares for several months due to the "current crisis," he has regained confidence, making significant purchases, including one acquisition exceeding $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

Due to stock market transparency rules, [[Warren Buffett]] is obligated to periodically disclose his stock purchases, sales, and main investments for the upcoming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. This article analyzes his favorite stocks for 2021, detailing why he invested in them and their potential future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Tracking [[Warren Buffetts current investment moves]]

Observing the investments of top performers like [[Warren Buffett]] is an effective way to generate investment ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Known as "the Oracle of Omaha" for his market foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>, [[Warren Buffett]] transformed a $1,000 initial investment into vast wealth, achieving over 20% annual returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) mandates large investors, including [[Warren Buffett]] (those with over $100 million in investments), to quarterly declare their stock transactions and primary holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>.

There are two main ways to access this information:
*   **Official Way**: Directly accessing the SEC website and searching for Berkshire Hathaway (his holding company) and its Form 13F filing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. This document, however, can be challenging to interpret for new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.
*   **Simplified Way**: Using websites that process SEC data into a more comprehensible format, such as Way Wisdom (.com) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Recent Stock Acquisitions]] and Sales

Through Way Wisdom, [[Warren Buffett]]'s recent investment shifts become clear.

### Major Sales
[[Warren Buffett]] has significantly reduced his investments in American banks like Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, and PNC Financial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. This suggests a cautious outlook on the banking sector for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### Key Purchases
His recent purchases have largely concentrated on pharmaceutical companies, including Bristol Myers, Merck, and AbbVie <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. Additionally, a substantial investment of over $9 billion was made in his own company, Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies]] Behind New Purchases

[[Warren Buffett]]'s recent pharmaceutical investments exemplify his characteristic [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies and insights]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. He typically seeks high-quality companies with predictable and growing income streams that are trading at attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. This undervaluation often occurs due to temporary solvable problems or market neglect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>.

Historically, pharmaceutical stocks traded at high valuations due to their excellent business models and strong long-term prospects, driven by an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. However, under the Trump administration (2016-2020), the sector faced pressure from continuous threats of new regulations that could reduce profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. With Trump's defeat and the incoming democratic administration's plan to invest heavily in healthcare, this threat has diminished <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. This leaves robust businesses that are resilient to economic crises, with doubled profits over the last five years and positive future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

The most appealing aspect for [[Warren Buffett]] is the attractive valuation, unseen in decades for these shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### Bristol Myers (BM)
[[Warren Buffett]] invested $1.8 billion in Bristol Myers, listed under ticker BM, trading at $61 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. This pharmaceutical company holds a strong market position in oncology and cardiovascular treatments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Its competitive advantage has led to a 30-fold stock price increase over the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

Bristol Myers shares are highly resistant to economic crises; the company confirmed a 6% growth in 2020 compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. It's expected to earn over $6 per share in 2020 and has projected over $7 per share for 2021, demonstrating high business visibility despite current uncertainties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

Historically, the pharmaceutical sector trades at 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. However, valuing Bristol Myers conservatively at 15 times earnings (the stock market average) on projected $7 earnings per share for 2021, leads to a target price exceeding $100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. This implies over 60% appreciation potential in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. Within five years, its value could reach $150-$200+ per share due to expected sector growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

### AbbVie (ABBV)
[[Warren Buffett]] also recently invested over $1 billion in AbbVie, listed under ticker ABBV, at $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. AbbVie also holds a leadership position in the pharmaceutical sector with a history of generating value and strong shareholder performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. Like Bristol Myers, it will not be negatively affected by the 2020 crisis, with profits expected to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

AbbVie's financials are impressive: revenue grew from $25 billion to over $50 billion in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. It boasts high profit margins, consistently over 40% on sales, a figure difficult even for [[Warren Buffett]]'s long-standing favorites like Coca-Cola (20% margins) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Earnings per share have risen from $4.80 to over $12 for 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Based on an expected $12 earnings per share for 2021 and a conservative 15 times earnings valuation, AbbVie could reach $180 per share in one year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. In five years, its intrinsic value could exceed $300 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

### Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.A/BRK.B)
The largest recent investment by [[Warren Buffett]] is a $9 billion acquisition of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway, trading at $230 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>.

[[Warren Buffett]] explained this move in a statement to investors: he and Charlie Munger believe Berkshire's shares are trading below their real value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>. The goal is to reduce the number of outstanding shares over time, making existing shareholders own a larger percentage of the company and increasing value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. This significant buyback indicates [[Warren Buffett]]'s conviction that Berkshire's shares are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

Historically, aggressive buybacks of Berkshire Hathaway shares by [[Warren Buffett]] have correlated with good stock performance, notably in 2011, 2016, and 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts portfolio and liquidity strategy]] for 2021

[[Warren Buffett]]'s 2021 portfolio largely hinges on six main investments, which constitute 80% of his holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

1.  **Apple (AAPL)**
    *   Investment: Over $109 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>
    *   Portfolio %: 47% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>
    *   Ticker: PL (AAPL) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>
    *   Price: $117 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>
    *   **Rationale**: Apple is considered one of the best businesses listed on the stock market, having multiplied its value by over 100 times in the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. [[Warren Buffett]] first invested in Apple in 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>, when it was a high-quality company with growth and a strong market position, but investors undervalued it, trading at just 8 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. He invested $20 billion at $25 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:32">[00:12:32]</a>. Since then, shares have multiplied by 5 times, generating over $80 trillion in profit for him and his shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a>. While its current valuation (around 30 times earnings) is demanding, it is justified for a company of such quality with future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:50">[00:12:50]</a>.

2.  **Bank of America (BAC)**
    *   Investment: Over $24 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>
    *   Portfolio %: Over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
    *   Ticker: VE (BAC) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>
    *   Price: $26 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:15">[00:13:15]</a>
    *   **Rationale**: Bank of America is one of the four major U.S. banks controlling an oligopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Post-2008 financial crisis, surviving banks enjoy higher returns on invested capital and high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>. Despite reducing exposure to other American banks (Wells Fargo, JP Morgan, Goldman Sachs), [[Warren Buffett]] maintains high conviction in Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. He states that banking is a good business if assets are managed wisely, with banks in his portfolio earning 12-16% on their tangible book value, which is attractive compared to low-yielding bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>. Bank of America currently trades below its historical average at just 12 times earnings, an attractive valuation with good future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

3.  **Coca-Cola (KO)**
    *   Investment: Over $19 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>
    *   Portfolio %: Over 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>
    *   Ticker: K.O. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>
    *   Price: $52 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>
    *   **Rationale**: [[Warren Buffett]]'s investment in Coca-Cola resembles his strategy with pharmaceutical companies and Apple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. He invested during a temporary problem (the "New Coke" fiasco 20+ years ago), capitalizing on a fundamentally good company with strong long-term prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:00">[00:15:00]</a>. His initial investment multiplied by over 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>, and he has publicly stated he will never sell a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Coca-Cola currently trades at 25 times its historical average earnings, a valuation justified for such a high-quality business with future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. It's considered a stock for conservative investors due to low debt and crisis resistance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:52">[00:15:52]</a>.

4.  **American Express (AXP)**
    *   Investment: Over $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:23">[00:16:23]</a>
    *   Portfolio %: Over 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:26">[00:16:26]</a>
    *   Ticker: XP (AXP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>
    *   Price: $110 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:32">[00:16:32]</a>
    *   **Rationale**: American Express is a strong business with high profit margins, high return on invested capital, and good future growth prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:41">[00:16:41]</a>. It operates in an oligopoly dominated alongside Visa and Mastercard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:51">[00:16:51]</a>. American Express is currently trading at an attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:56">[00:16:56]</a>. It is estimated that the company could earn over $10 in earnings per share for the next 3-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Historically, it has traded at over 20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:05">[00:17:05]</a>. This suggests a target price above $200 in five years, potentially doubling his money, which translates to an average annual return of over 15%—the minimum return [[Warren Buffett]] seeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>.

5.  **Kraft Heinz (KHC)**
    *   Investment: Over $9 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>
    *   Portfolio %: Over 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:52">[00:17:52]</a>
    *   Ticker: KHC <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:55">[00:17:55]</a>
    *   Price: $32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>
    *   **Rationale**: Kraft Heinz is a renowned food products company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. It's one of the few investments where [[Warren Buffett]] is suffering losses, having invested over five years ago at $80 per share, with shares dropping over 50% since <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. [[Warren Buffett]] publicly admitted his main mistake was paying too high a price relative to the company's earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:17">[00:18:17]</a>. Kraft Heinz also faces issues with high debt and declining popularity of its products due to healthier eating trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Despite losses, [[Warren Buffett]] maintains his position likely because the company now trades at an interesting valuation multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>. For highly indebted consumer companies like Kraft Heinz, the EV/EBITDA valuation ratio is more suitable as it accounts for debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>. Historically, Kraft Heinz has traded around 14 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:37">[00:19:37]</a>. It currently trades below its historical average at 10 times EBITDA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>. With debt levels reduced and revenue/profits stabilized, it may return to its historical average, implying a target value of $50 per share, currently trading at $32 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:57">[00:19:57]</a>.

6.  **Moody's (MCO)**
    *   Investment: Over $7 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>
    *   Portfolio %: Over 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:23">[00:20:23]</a>
    *   Ticker: MC (MCO) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>
    *   Price: $270 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>
    *   **Rationale**: Moody's aligns with [[Warren Buffett]]'s ideal investment: a company with a dominant market position, resilience to crises, high profit margins, and predictable earnings per share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:31">[00:20:31]</a>. It's unaffected by crises like the 2020 pandemic and is expected to grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:49">[00:20:49]</a>. Moody's, alongside Standard & Poor's and Fitch, controls the debt rating agency oligopoly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>. These companies have significant pricing power due to limited competition and an unregulated sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:03">[00:21:03]</a>, providing exceptional stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:19">[00:21:19]</a>.
    *   **Valuation**: Historically, Moody's has traded around 25 times earnings, which is its current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:24">[00:21:24]</a>. The company has grown its earnings per share by over 15% annually in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:31">[00:21:31]</a>. Projecting this growth, Moody's could earn around $20 per share by 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>. Multiplied by its historical 25 times earnings valuation, this suggests a target price of $500 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>. This represents a potential 100% return, equivalent to that 15% average annual compound return [[Warren Buffett]] seeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:55">[00:21:55]</a>.

The six stocks discussed comprise 80% of [[Warren Buffett]]'s portfolio, indicating his high conviction in these investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:28">[00:22:28]</a>. The remaining 20% is more diversified but adheres to the same [[Warren Buffetts investment principles]]: quality stocks resistant to crises and bought at reasonable valuation multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:37">[00:22:37]</a>. These include Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, McDonald's, and DaVita <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:51">[00:22:51]</a>.

This article outlines methods for [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | analyzing stock market investments]] and [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | identifying good investment opportunities]], drawing on the experience of a fund manager. It covers how to research companies, evaluate their intrinsic value, and navigate market conditions.

## Investment Philosophy and Approach

The speaker, a fund manager, never imagined such widespread interest in investing and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. A significant portion of personal assets are invested in the funds they manage, which in turn hold stocks the manager favors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. The management company oversees approximately 120 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>.

A key insight shared is that private investors hold a considerable advantage in [[investment_opportunities_in_quality_stocks | small cap]] stocks compared to professionals, as small amounts of capital are easier to deploy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. For instance, the True Value Small Caps fund, which began with modest capital (4-10 million), has shown significantly better performance than the larger True Value fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>. This highlights the agility in managing smaller sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>.

The speaker aims to teach individuals "how to fish" rather than simply providing stock recommendations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>. All information provided is for educational purposes and does not constitute financial advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Analyzing Companies

[[analyzing_company_fundamentals_for_investment | Analyzing company fundamentals for investment]] involves a systematic approach, starting with readily available information.

### Research Process
1.  **Investor Relations Website:** The first step in researching a company is to visit its investor relations website (e.g., "IDT investor relations") <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:26">[00:07:26]</a>.
    *   Look for annual reports, quarterly reports, press releases, and investor presentations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>. Presentations are often more concise for initial understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.
2.  **Financial Data Platforms:** Utilize tools like Yahoo Finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a> and TKR (an invitation-only tool) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:51">[00:33:51]</a> to access quotes, financials, and analyst estimates.
3.  **Language Barriers:** Some of the best investment opportunities have been found in companies that do not translate their reports into English, as this deters many international investors and analysts, leading to undervalued stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>.

### Key Financial Metrics and Concepts
*   **Operating Leverage:** A business with high operating leverage will see profits increase significantly with higher sales because costs do not rise proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.
*   **Spinoffs:** When a company lists parts of its business independently, it can unlock significant value for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. Spinoffs can often be undervalued at first, especially international ones <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:03">[00:22:03]</a>.
*   **Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs):** These are empty shell companies that go public quickly, often without the same regulatory scrutiny as traditional IPOs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:11">[00:40:11]</a>. They can be speculative, and investors should be cautious, sometimes selling for a quick profit when they are promoted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.
*   **Gross Merchant Value (GMV):** For marketplace businesses, GMV (the total value of goods sold by third-party sellers on the platform) is a key metric for valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:36">[00:26:36]</a>.
*   **Normalized Earnings/Profit:** This refers to earnings adjusted for non-recurring or unusual items, providing a clearer picture of a company's sustainable profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:04">[01:04:04]</a>.

### Examples of Stock Analysis

#### IDT Corporation (IDT)
*   **Business Model:** IDT has a mature business generating strong cash flow, which it reinvests into high-growth, disruptive technological businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. These high-growth divisions are then sold or spun off to larger corporations, like AT&T <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. The founder, Howard Jonas, has a history of generating value through six such spinoffs, resulting in an average annual return of 20% for shareholders over 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>.
*   **Divisions:**
    *   **BOSS Revolution:** A money transfer service growing impressively, expanding into Point of Sale terminals for small businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:35">[01:11:35]</a>.
    *   **Net to Fone:** A cloud communications service offering low-cost calls digitally, growing at 42% annually, particularly strong in the Latin American market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:30">[01:12:30]</a>.
    *   **Traditional Telecommunications:** Provides stable cash flow but is not growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Despite appreciating, IDT is considered undervalued. With a market capitalization of $500 million, subtracting its $120 million in liquidity (and NOLS, which provide tax deductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:10">[01:15:10]</a>), the business is effectively acquired for $380 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. The traditional business alone produces about $60 million in profit, valuing it at approximately six times earnings, which is very cheap for a telecommunications business (normally 12-15x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:38">[01:15:38]</a>. The true value lies in the growth divisions, with Money Transfer alone potentially worth $400 million and Net to Fone undervalued, suggesting a sum-of-the-parts value of up to $50 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:53">[01:15:53]</a>. Similar cloud communications companies like RingCentral (RNG) are valued at 40 times sales, while IDT's Net to Fone is valued much more conservatively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:40">[01:17:40]</a>.

#### Cedon
*   **Business Model:** Described as "the Amazon of Sweden," Cedon is an e-commerce marketplace <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:21">[00:21:21]</a>. It transitioned from a 1P (own sales) model to a 3P (marketplace) model, where it earns commissions from third-party sellers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>. This model has higher profit margins and lower inventory risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">[00:25:02]</a>.
*   **Origin:** Cedon was a spinoff from another Swedish company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:32">[00:21:32]</a>. When it was listed, its market capitalization was low (150 million euros, now 400 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:49">[00:21:49]</a>), and initial information was only in Swedish, which limited attention from international investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:09">[00:22:09]</a>.
*   **Growth:** The marketplace part of the business is growing rapidly (60% year-over-year previously, now 86%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:38">[00:25:38]</a>. This growth, coupled with operating leverage, leads to significant increases in EBITDA (e.g., 60% sales growth generating 300% EBITDA increase) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:39">[00:27:39]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Cedon is still considered cheap by relative measures, trading at 1x gross merchant value for 2021, compared to similar marketplaces trading between 5-10x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>. An analyst recently initiated coverage with a buy recommendation, suggesting a target price of 850, significantly higher than its current trading price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:43">[00:29:43]</a>.

#### Lokit Martin (LMT)
*   **Business:** A major defense contractor, known for products like the F-22 and F-35 fighter jets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:09">[00:35:09]</a>.
*   **Market Misconception:** The stock often drops when Democrats win in the US due to a false belief that defense budgets will be significantly cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:28">[00:34:28]</a>. However, key programs vital for military supremacy are rarely cut <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:51">[00:35:51]</a>. Historically, during periods of defense budget cuts (e.g., 1990-1995), Lockheed Martin either maintained or increased profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:56">[00:35:56]</a>.
*   **Geopolitical Factors:** Rising military spending by China (from $100 billion to $250 billion estimated in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:37">[00:37:37]</a>) compels the US to continue investing in advanced defense technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:51">[00:36:51]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Considered cheap relative to its historical average. Its normalized earnings for the current year are estimated at $26 per share, growing at 12-17% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:07">[00:38:07]</a>. Historically, it trades at 20 times earnings, implying a target price of $500, with potential for $600 next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.

#### Globant (GLOB) & Nagarro (NA9)
*   **Business Model:** These are computer engineering companies that utilize an "offshore" model, hiring engineers in regions with lower labor costs (e.g., Latin America for Globant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:47">[00:51:47]</a>, India for Nagarro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:57">[00:53:57]</a>) to work remotely on projects like creating online banking applications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:05">[00:52:05]</a>. This model allows them to steal market share from traditional companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:41">[00:52:41]</a>.
*   **Growth & Valuation:** Globant has grown its turnover from $250 million to $888 million in 5 years, with annual growth rates of ~25% and EBITDA growing from $30 million to $150 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. While it trades at a high multiple (80 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:59">[00:56:59]</a>), the market justifies this due to the massive market size ($300 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:25">[00:53:25]</a>) and potential for sustained 20% annual growth for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:10">[00:57:10]</a>.
*   Nagarro, a recent spinoff, also shows impressive growth (revenue doubled from $200M to $400M between 2017-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:55">[00:55:55]</a>, expected to reach $500M in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:10">[00:56:10]</a>), but is trading at a more attractive valuation than Globant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:47">[00:57:47]</a>. Based on earnings, Nagarro could be worth $240 per share with similar valuations, or $141 at a more conservative 40x earnings, compared to its current price of $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>.

## Market Conditions and Investment Strategy

[[analysis_of_stock_market_trends | Analysis of stock market trends]] is crucial for investors. The current market presents a dichotomy: parts are experiencing euphoria and are expensive, while others show pessimism and are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:55">[00:43:55]</a>.

### Current Market Sentiment
*   Overall, the market is slightly more expensive than average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:46">[00:44:46]</a>.
*   Low interest rates, quantitative easing by the Fed, and vaccine recovery contribute to a positive outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:50">[00:44:50]</a>.
*   There is a lot of speculation, particularly in companies with no profits or extremely high valuations (e.g., Nicola and QuantumScape, which are valued in billions despite having zero sales) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:51">[00:39:51]</a>.
*   A rotation in the market is expected, where expensive stocks will become more reasonable, and cheaper stocks will appreciate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:06">[00:39:06]</a>.

### Managing Market Volatility
*   It's difficult to predict market crises consistently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:09">[01:19:09]</a>.
*   **Maintain Liquidity:** Keep some cash (e.g., 10-20% in funds, or personally) to capitalize on market drops by buying at good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:27">[01:19:27]</a>.
*   **Discipline:** Do not overreact and panic sell during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:01">[01:22:01]</a>.
*   **Historical Volatility:** The market typically sees a 10% fall every 12 months, and drops greater than 20% every 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:23">[01:28:23]</a>. Large drops (40-50%) occur every 20-30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:53">[01:28:53]</a>.
*   **Fed Influence:** The Fed (Federal Reserve) heavily influences the market through liquidity, interest rates, and quantitative easing. A change in the Fed's narrative would be a cause for concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:59">[01:23:59]</a>.

### Portfolio Construction and Diversification
*   **Focus on a Select Few:** Do not try to predict every stock's movement. Instead, focus on a portfolio of 15-30 companies that have good prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:32">[00:50:32]</a>.
*   **Diversification:** For beginners, start with at least 10-15 stocks, or even 20-25 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:15">[01:14:15]</a>. This provides a safe way to start and ensure a good overall experience, even if individual stocks underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:39">[01:13:39]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View:** Investments should be considered with a 3-5 year horizon, focusing on average growth and future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:02">[01:12:02]</a>.
*   **Avoid Over-Concentration:** Putting all savings into a few trendy stocks during euphoria is a common mistake leading to bad experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:31">[01:14:31]</a>.

### Valuation and Expected Returns
*   **Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio:** The market currently trades at 22 times future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:19">[01:21:19]</a>. While this is not as extreme as historical bubbles (e.g., Japan's Nikkei at 100x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:47">[01:21:47]</a>), it implies a low expected return for the overall S&P 500 over the next 5 years (around zero, based on historical data) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:09">[01:28:09]</a>.
*   **Stock Picking:** In a market where the index has low expected returns, [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | stock picking]] (selecting individual undervalued companies with good prospects) becomes more important than passive investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:12">[01:29:12]</a>.
*   **Minimum Return Expectation:** When researching stocks, aim for an expectation of earning more than the market average (historically around 8%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | Stock market analysis and investment opportunities]] are abundant for those who understand the process. Investing should be approached with common sense, rationality, and without greed, aiming for a good long-term experience rather than quick riches <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:33">[01:15:33]</a>. It is crucial to understand the underlying business model, future prospects, and valuation of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:08">[01:34:08]</a>. While the market may experience volatility, disciplined investors can capitalize on opportunities that arise during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

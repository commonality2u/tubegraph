[[role_of_small_and_lesserknown_stocks_in_investment_portfolios | Smallcap stocks]] and small companies are a significant area of focus in [[investment_strategies_in_small_caps_and_favorable_market_segments | investment strategies]], particularly for the [[advice_for_small_investors | small investor]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>. Historically, they have offered higher returns than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:50">[01:48:50]</a>.

## Advantages of Investing in Small Companies
[[advantages_of_investing_in_small_companies | Small companies]] are often less followed by analysts, have less liquidity, and possess a greater potential for growth, leading to more possibilities for long-term multiplication of value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:53">[01:51:53]</a>. For individual investors, small companies can present [[investment_opportunities_in_smallcap_stocks | incredible opportunities]] that larger funds cannot access due to liquidity limitations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>. This can lead to excess returns and a decrease in risk, as risk is determined by company quality and purchase price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:18">[02:17:18]</a>.

## Historical Underperformance and Current Trends
In the period following the 2008 financial crisis, especially over the last 13 years, small caps have faced a constant struggle compared to large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:02">[02:00:02]</a>.
For instance:
*   The Russell 2000, a smallcap index, rose only 50% over nearly 10 years (an average of 4-5% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:18">[02:19:18]</a>.
*   In contrast, the S&P 500, a large-cap index, doubled (rising 100% or 9-10% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:26">[02:29:26]</a>.
Historically, the smallcap market typically yielded 11-12% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:42">[02:42:42]</a>. This underperformance was largely due to an environment of easy money and capital flow towards indexed [[investment_strategies_in_small_caps_and_favorable_market_segments | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:01:03">[03:01:03]</a>.

However, a new era is emerging, with central banks indicating an imminent economic recession in the first quarter of 2023 for the Eurozone and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>. This period of change, described by Howard Marks as a "transcendental change" in investing, suggests that past strategies favoring large caps may no longer be effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:29">[00:29:29]</a>. The withdrawal of liquidity from the system, initiated by central banks, particularly impacts companies with less liquidity, which often includes small caps, leading to "forced sales" unrelated to business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:05">[00:53:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:05">[01:53:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:41">[01:57:41]</a>. This creates a fertile ground for future opportunities in [[investment_opportunities_in_smallcap_stocks | smallcap investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:16">[01:57:16]</a>.

There is a growing expectation that small companies will become more favored, especially as they are currently valued much cheaper than large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Examples of Smallcap Investment Dynamics
### Grupeggin vs. J Maki (Packaging Sector)
*   **Grupeggin (Smallcap):** A historic company in the food packaging sector, it is a small company (370 million market cap) not included in major indices, with low liquidity and analyst coverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:31">[02:22:31]</a>. It has a stable business, growing sales by an average of 5% per year, and very low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:46">[02:42:46]</a>. Despite its strong fundamentals and cash flow generation, it trades at only 8 times earnings, half the valuation of comparable large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:01">[02:00:01]</a>.
*   **J Maki (Large-cap):** A company ten times larger than Grupeggin, also in plastic containers. It benefits from its inclusion in indices and high liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:45">[02:45:45]</a>. Despite similar growth (6% annually) and comparable earnings per share, it trades at 60% more expensive than Grupeggin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>.

### GDI vs. Compass Group (Building Maintenance)
*   **GDI (Smallcap/Non-indexed):** A Canadian company providing building maintenance services, characterized by crisis resistance and predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:27">[02:52:27]</a>. It has a low trading volume and is not included in major indices, making it "forgotten" by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:08">[02:59:08]</a>. It has grown 20% annually even during the 2008-2009 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:50">[02:59:50]</a>.
*   **Compass Group (Large-cap/Indexed):** One of the largest global companies in the sector. It grows less (6% annually) than GDI but commands a much higher valuation (26 times free cash flow compared to GDI's estimated 13 times) simply due to its size and inclusion in major indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:35">[03:07:35]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:55">[03:25:55]</a>.

### Nagarro (International Smallcap)
Nagarro, a German-listed digital engineering company, is smaller and not in major US indices, which typically puts it at a disadvantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:50">[03:50:50]</a>. Despite higher growth potential and current growth rates (Nagarro grew 40-35% this year, more than Globalt), it trades at a significantly lower valuation than its US-listed counterpart, Globalt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:51">[03:51:51]</a>.

### Berry Global (Value Investing Example)
Berry Global, in the industrial packaging sector, is a stable, profitable business with consistent free cash flow generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:31">[03:51:31]</a>. It has grown sales by 11% and profits by 17% since 2016 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:31">[03:51:31]</a>. Despite strong fundamentals and growth, its valuation multiple has seen "brutal compression" since 2018 (when "growth at any price" strategies dominated), trading at only 8 times earnings, half its historical average of 15 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:17:16">[04:17:16]</a>. This presents a significant opportunity as the company is buying back shares due to believing its stock is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:29:29">[04:29:29]</a>.

## Investing in a Bear Market and Recession
The current bear market, characterized by central bank actions and recession fears, is sweeping across the market, causing even quality smallcap companies to fall significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:03:05">[03:03:05]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:03">[03:05:03]</a>. This creates a "good breeding ground" for future [[investment_opportunities_in_smallcap_stocks | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:59">[03:06:59]</a>. While the S&P 500 has fallen 20% and Nasdaq 30% from its highs, smallcaps have experienced even larger declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:21">[03:07:21]</a>. This is partly due to reduced liquidity, leading to forced sales unrelated to business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:40">[03:07:40]</a>.

During recessions, some sectors, such as discretionary consumption, tend to perform well in anticipation of recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>. Conversely, sectors like technology and industrials may struggle initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:41">[01:17:41]</a>. However, safer sectors like healthcare and utilities, while stable during crises, may not see as significant a rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:03">[01:18:03]</a>.

## The Small Investor's Opportunity
For the [[advice_for_small_investors | small investor]], the current environment presents a unique opportunity. When share prices fall due to market-wide fear rather than individual company problems, the risk of permanent loss is reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>. This allows for purchasing shares in stable businesses at very low valuations, which can perform well even in difficult economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>.

It is crucial for investors to learn how to analyze stocks, understand what is expensive versus cheap, and focus on companies with strong fundamentals, good management, and predictable business models that can survive economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:48">[01:39:48]</a>. This "cockroach business model" approach, focusing on resilience and value, is highly applicable for individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:49">[01:03:49]</a>.

Warren Buffett, considered the greatest investor of all time, revealed seven basic principles he used to achieve his tremendous success in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. One of his most crucial pieces of advice, especially for beginners, is to always buy shares below their [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:28">[00:14:28]</a>.

## Defining Intrinsic Value
[[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | Intrinsic value]] is a subjective value that an investor calculates before investing in a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. It is determined through the process of [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | stock valuation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. To determine a business's [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]], investors must make a conservative estimate of the profits the company can generate in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. These estimated benefits are then used with various [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | valuation]] methods to arrive at the [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

> [!INFO] Why Valuation Matters
> Even if a company is considered "good," investors cannot simply invest at any price in the stock market; understanding the [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | valuation]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>.

## Acting on Intrinsic Value
The core principle is to compare the calculated [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] with the current market price of a stock.
*   **When market price is above [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]]**: It is generally not a good time to invest, as the shares may subsequently decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>.
*   **When market price is below [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]]**: This indicates a good investment opportunity, and subsequent performance in the stock market has historically been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

### Practical Example: Coca-Cola
Taking Coca-Cola shares as an example, the blue line in an [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | asset valuation]] graph represents the calculated [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]], while the red line indicates the market price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>.
*   In 2003 and 2004, when Coca-Cola's market price was above its [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]], it was not a good time to invest, and the shares subsequently went down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>.
*   Conversely, in 2009 or 2012, when the market price was below the [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]], the stock's performance was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

## Learning and Application
While valuing shares might seem overwhelming, it is described as a simple process that requires some learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:47">[00:15:47]</a>. This emphasis on [[importance_of_knowledge_in_investing | knowledge in investing]] is a hallmark of [[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | value investing]] principles.

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has significantly impacted stock markets and the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. The Russian stock market, for instance, has collapsed more severely than during the 2008 crisis or the 2020 confinement <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. As of the time of the recording, the Russian stock index had fallen 40% from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>, a more severe drop than during the panic of March 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. Other stock markets also experienced declines due to escalating tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Immediate Economic Consequences
The [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | geopolitical tensions and their economic impact]] have manifested in several ways:

*   **Energy Market Impact**
    *   Germany suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was intended to bring Russian gas to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This action caused gas prices in Europe to skyrocket, exacerbating an already high price environment due to supply crises and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.
    *   Rising energy costs, including oil approaching $100 per barrel (up from $50 a year prior), reduce consumer disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Since consumption accounts for 70% of the economy, this reduction in disposable income can be severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>.
    *   Russia is one of the world's largest oil producers, accounting for 10% of global daily consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Even a small production gap can cause disproportionate price increases, as seen in 2008 when oil jumped from $100 to $150 in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. Sanctions on Russia's oil trade could create a global bottleneck, severely impacting energy costs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
    *   The price of European natural gas tripled year-on-year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. While Germany asserted a secure supply, it noted uncertainty regarding the price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>. Gas exports from Russia to Europe were already at very low levels in 2021 due to prior tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. For more information, see [[energy_crisis_and_geopolitical_tensions | Energy crisis and geopolitical tensions]] and [[energy_and_raw_material_markets_under_geopolitical_tensions | energy and raw material markets under geopolitical tensions]].

*   **SWIFT System Exclusion**
    *   Western countries threatened to exclude Russia from the SWIFT system, which would significantly limit international trade in euros, pounds, and especially dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While Russia would be the primary victim, such obstacles to global trade are detrimental to everyone, as many Western companies derive significant sales from the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.

*   **Agriculture and Food Prices**
    *   The conflict impacts industry, agriculture, and food, aggravating already rising food prices due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">[00:06:53]</a>.
    *   Russia is the fourth-largest producer of grains or wheat worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Including Ukraine, these two countries account for approximately 20% of global grain production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. A reduction in this supply due to conflict or sanctions can cause disproportionate price increases in commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:49">[00:07:49]</a>.
    *   The fertilizer market is a critical point, as Russia and Ukraine are major producers of potassium, a key component for fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>. Russia, including Belarusian production, holds almost 20% of the world's potassium supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">[00:08:49]</a>. High fertilizer prices ultimately contribute to higher food costs and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. This inflationary pressure is a significant factor behind recent stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Historical [[Stock market behavior in response to economic changes | Stock Market Behavior in Response to Economic Changes]] and Conflicts
Historically, stock markets often fall before conflicts, reflecting anxiety about uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:15">[00:10:15]</a>. However, once negative events occur, markets often realize it's "not the end of the world" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

*   **"Buy with the drums of war"**: A saying in the stock market suggests buying during the anticipation of war and selling once the conflict is resolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.
*   **Past Conflicts and Recoveries**:
    *   In conflicts like Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, and Crimea, the market's behavior in the months following the start of the conflict was often bullish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>.
    *   The invasion of Iraq in 1990, which caused one of the biggest falls, saw a full market recovery in just 180 days (six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
    *   The Pearl Harbor attack, with a 20% market drop, recovered in less than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Market Dynamics**: Markets tend to fall *before* conflicts, as the uncertainty generates fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. When the event actually happens, the perceived catastrophe often doesn't materialize, and the economy, while potentially slowing in affected areas for a year or two, eventually returns to normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

## [[Investment Strategies During Economic and Geopolitical Tensions | Investment Strategies During Economic and Geopolitical Tensions]]
During times of conflict, certain [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | investment strategies]] prove more effective:

*   **Investment Styles Performance**:
    *   Small-cap stocks, which normally yield 1-11% annually, have seen greater returns when bought during conflicts, as assets are cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
    *   Large-cap stocks similarly show slightly higher returns when bought at the start of conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
    *   Conversely, "safe" investments like bonds (10- or 5-year) yield *less* return during conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This is because people move money from falling stocks into bonds, making bonds more expensive and reducing their future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.
    *   When there is fear and problems in the market, good returns can be made because people are willing to sell shares at lower prices due to lack of conviction or knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:53">[00:14:53]</a>.

*   **Cyclical vs. Non-Cyclical Stocks**:
    *   Cyclical stocks (e.g., oil, banking, raw materials, airlines) should be evaluated differently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>. The best time to buy them is when their P/E valuation is highest, because that's when raw material prices (which influence their cyclicality) are lowest, and results are set to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">[00:20:59]</a>. These stocks are considered "good for renting, not for investing" in the long term, meaning they are better for speculation than long-term ownership <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:36">[00:24:36]</a>.
    *   Non-cyclical companies, especially those with strong fundamentals that can increase profits in the long term, are preferred for long-term investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>.

*   **Downward Averaging**: Buying more shares as their price drops can help investors take advantage of market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. However, this strategy is risky without proper knowledge, as some companies can go bankrupt, leading to total loss of investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.

*   **Risk Management**: Investors must understand the risks they face <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:35">[00:35:35]</a>. Drops of 5%, 10%, or even 20% are common in individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">[00:41:29]</a>. Warren Buffett advises that anyone not prepared to see their portfolio fall 40-50% should not be investing in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>. It is crucial to react temperately and not panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:08">[00:41:08]</a>.

*   **Focus on Fundamentals**: During macro fears, it's essential to focus on the individual company's fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">[00:38:22]</a>. A company with good results, steady growth, strong margins, low debt, and shareholder remuneration is more attractive than one facing internal business deterioration, even if macro conditions are good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

### Company Examples

*   **Defense Stocks**: Companies like Lockheed Martin and Dassault Aviation, which manufacture military equipment (e.g., F-22, F-35 jets, missile systems, submarines, aircraft for the French army), tend to rise during geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

*   **Gazprom (Russia)**: This Russian gas and oil producer saw significant declines in its stock price despite skyrocketing gas prices, due to fears of sanctions that would limit its ability to trade in dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Gazprom traded at a P/E ratio of 2.5, significantly lower than the global average of 15-16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:00">[00:19:00]</a>. The low valuation in the Russian market (averaging five times earnings) reflects concerns about private property rights and expropriation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:25">[00:19:25]</a>.

*   **Mosaic (Fertilizer Sector)**: As Russia and Ukraine are major fertilizer producers, sanctions could benefit international fertilizer companies like Mosaic, as they would face reduced competition and higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>. Mosaic's stock price had already doubled in the last year due to inflation and rising food/grain prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This company is a prime example of a cyclical stock that has historically failed to generate long-term value, emphasizing the "renting" vs. "owning" strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:32">[00:23:32]</a>.

*   **Kiwi (Russian PayPal)**: This Russian digital payment company experienced a more than 15% fall on the day of the recording due to the panic in Russian stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:38">[00:26:38]</a>. It traded at only 7 dollars, down from 21 dollars, with an estimated dividend yield of almost 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:58">[00:26:58]</a>. Despite solid fundamentals and projected growth, it traded at approximately four times earnings, which is extremely low for a company that expects to double sales in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>.

*   **Adobe (Technology)**: Adobe experienced a significant drop, falling almost 40% from its highs, partly due to slightly below-expectation results and general market negativity towards technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">[00:31:21]</a>. However, it maintains strong competitive advantages, a successful transition to a cloud-based subscription model, and is projected to double sales and profits in the next four to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>.

*   **Inhouse (Technology)**: This technology company, a main position in a fund, is valued at 16 times free cash flow and is expected to grow between 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>. It has no debt, reducing risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:42">[00:39:42]</a>.

*   **Green Landscaping**: This company, primarily operating in Sweden and expanding to the Nordic region, announced a share buyback program, indicating that its management believes the shares are undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. It trades around 15 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:57">[00:52:57]</a>.

*   **Global (Digital Engineering)**: This company, like others in the digital engineering sector, has seen corrections but maintains a long-term growth perspective, with analysts projecting 25% growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. The digital engineering market is substantial and growing, with listed companies well-positioned to capitalize on this demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">[00:54:40]</a>.

## Conclusion on [[Impact of global economic conditions on markets | Impact of Global Economic Conditions on Markets]] and [[Investment strategies during times of geopolitical tension | Investment Strategies During Times of Geopolitical Tension]]
Periods of market crisis and high volatility, like those caused by geopolitical conflicts, are often when the most money can be made in the stock market for prepared investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:13">[00:29:13]</a>. While conflicts are economically detrimental, they are not catastrophic or "the end of the world" for markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>. Sooner or later, situations resolve, and markets tend to recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:26">[00:57:26]</a>.

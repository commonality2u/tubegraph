Michael Burry's recent investment strategies highlight a focus on assets that can benefit from [[investment_opportunities_in_inflationary_environments | inflationary environments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He has structured his portfolio to benefit from assets that are expected to rise, and to bet against those that may be harmed by inflation, such as growth stocks and bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">[00:05:45]</a>. This approach mirrors his famous 2007 bet against subprime mortgages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Macroeconomic Outlook and Inflation
Burry believes that a period of high inflation is coming over the next months or years, which could significantly impact various assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>. He draws an analogy between current inflation and that of the Weimar Republic in the 1920s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. He argues that unlike previous quantitative easing, money is now reaching the real economy through distributed checks, leading to increased spending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

This spending, combined with problems in supply chains (e.g., shortages of steel, copper, aluminum, wood) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>, forces companies to raise prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. Consequently, workers' wages will increase, and the prices of goods and services will rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. Eventually, central banks like the Fed will need to raise interest rates to control inflation, which would cause bond prices to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:21">[00:17:21]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Raw Materials
While Michael Burry's primary bet against inflation is through put options on bond ETFs like TLT (20-year bonds) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a> and inverse leveraged bond ETFs like TBT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:05">[00:13:05]</a>, he has also invested in companies related to raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:15">[00:49:15]</a>.

### Oil and Gas Companies
Raw material companies, especially those in oil and gas, can benefit from inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>.

#### Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)
*   **Company Profile**: A Canadian company that produces and extracts oil, including from oil sands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:57">[00:51:57]</a>. It also produces gas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:10">[00:53:10]</a>.
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   High reserves (almost 30 years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:13">[00:55:13]</a>.
    *   Low debt, which is crucial for volatile, cyclical companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:17">[00:55:17]</a>.
    *   Trades at a low multiple (e.g., around four times free cash flow when discussed) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:15">[00:56:15]</a>.
    *   Historically increased dividends (e.g., 15% annually over five years, 12% over ten years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:29">[00:58:29]</a>.
    *   Considered one of the best companies in Canada with a low valuation compared to rivals like ExxonMobil, BP, Chevron, and Suncor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:06">[00:57:06]</a>.

#### Lundin Energy (LUNE.ST / LUN.TO)
*   **Company Profile**: A Swedish oil company with production in Canada, Malaysia, and Europe (France) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:45">[01:22:45]</a>. It is well-managed by the Lundin family <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:50">[01:21:50]</a>.
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   Produces around 43,000 barrels of oil per day <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:23:43">[01:23:43]</a>.
    *   Trades at very low valuations (e.g., two and a half times operating cash flow or three and a half times free cash flow at current prices) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:33">[01:24:33]</a>.
    *   Has 18 years of reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:01">[01:26:01]</a>.
    *   The market often undervalues such companies, perceiving that oil prices are unsustainable or that the company will cease production sooner than its reserves suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.

### Copper Companies
Copper is another raw material expected to perform well due to several drivers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:05">[01:13:05]</a>.

#### Atalaya Mining (ATYM.L)
*   **Company Profile**: A Spanish copper production company listed in the United Kingdom, operating an open-pit copper mine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:37">[01:12:37]</a>.
*   **Key Drivers for Copper**:
    *   **Inflation**: Raw material prices are expected to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:12">[01:13:12]</a>.
    *   **Supply-Demand Imbalance**: Years of bear market in raw materials have led to underinvestment in new mines, while demand for copper continues to increase (e.g., for electrical components, industrial construction) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:15">[01:13:15]</a>. This creates a bullish price environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:41">[01:13:41]</a>.
    *   **Electric Vehicles (EVs)**: Electric cars have a high copper content, requiring significantly more copper (e.g., 90 kg per electric car vs. 25 kg for a normal car) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:02">[01:16:02]</a>. The expected surge in EV production by 2025-2030 will drive demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>.
    *   **Electrification of Society**: Growing electrification of various products (scooters, bicycles, motorcycles, jet skis, even potential airplanes) will further increase copper demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:45">[01:17:45]</a>.
    *   **Emerging Economies**: Growing economies like India and Latin America will also increase copper consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>.
*   **Key Metrics**:
    *   Reported strong EBITDA (e.g., almost 50 million in the first quarter) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:44">[01:18:44]</a>.
    *   Expected to end the year with a cash flow of 70-80 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:50">[01:18:50]</a>.
    *   Has no debt and could potentially pay significant dividends if copper prices remain high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:49">[01:18:49]</a>.

### Gold
Surprisingly, Michael Burry has not focused on gold to benefit from inflation, which might seem logical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:19">[01:19:19]</a>. He considers bonds to be in a "bubble season" and believes that the upside from a bond bubble bursting due to inflation is much greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:58">[01:54:58]</a>. Gold had already seen price increases as people were somewhat discounting inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:37">[01:54:37]</a>.

## General Considerations for Raw Material Investments
*   **Cyclical Nature**: Raw materials companies are often cyclical, meaning their performance is tied to economic cycles. This can lead to significant drops during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:40">[01:54:40]</a>.
*   **Debt Management**: It is crucial for raw materials companies to have low debt, as high debt can lead to bankruptcy during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:21">[01:55:21]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Value**: Even if stock prices have been depressed in the long term, adding dividends can reveal higher profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>. The expected yield is often the current dividend yield plus the future growth of the dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.
*   **Market Perception**: The market may offer these companies at low valuations due to perceived unsustainability of current commodity prices or general negativity towards the sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:15">[01:25:15]</a>.

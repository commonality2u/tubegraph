Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater team predict a new risk for the stock market in September, potentially leading to an additional drop of 20 to 25 percent [00:00:14]. This risk is expected to affect all investors to some extent, making it difficult to completely avoid [00:00:29].

## Current Market Risks

The market currently faces three major risks [00:03:46]:
1.  **Pressure from Multiples** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>: The S&P 500's price-to-earnings ratio has fallen from 24 times to about 17 times earnings, nearing its historical average. This risk is considered largely implicit in current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Drop in Profits** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>: A recession could lead to a 10-20% drop in corporate profits, which directly impacts stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This risk is not yet fully priced into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
3.  **Systemic Liquidity** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>: This is closely related to interest rates. When money is abundant, investment and business confidence are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. However, the Federal Reserve (Fed) has drastically changed its course, raising rates faster than expected and withdrawing liquidity from the system [00:05:04].

Points 2 and 3 are closely correlated: raising rates quickly can cause a recession, leading to a drop in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. Conversely, if the Fed avoids causing a recession, inflation problems may persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. It is highly probable that at least two of these three risks will materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.

### Quantitative Tightening (QT)

A new and equally dangerous risk is Quantitative Tightening (QT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, the opposite of Quantitative Easing (QE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. Central banks use two main tools: printing/withdrawing money from the system and setting interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. While interest rate hikes have caused drops, the full impact of QT, or money withdrawal, is yet to be felt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

Starting in September, the Fed will aggressively withdraw $90-95 billion monthly, totaling almost a trillion dollars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>, [00:08:35]. Historically, periods of money withdrawal (QT) have corresponded with the market performing worst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>, and small-cap companies tend to suffer in such scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>. The Fed plans to reduce its balance sheet to pre-pandemic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

Historically, September is often the worst month for the stock market, primarily due to psychological factors like people returning from vacation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:23">[01:22:23]</a>, [01:32:31].

## [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | Portfolio Management and Investment Strategy]]

Ray Dalio and Bridgewater emphasize that it's impossible to completely escape the predicted market fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:50">[01:34:50]</a>. Their advice for investors includes:
*   [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | Reduce risks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>.
*   [[importance_of_portfolio_diversification | Diversify globally]] across assets, not just regions. This means holding a mix of bonds and quality, non-cyclical stocks from companies with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>, [01:40:17].
*   [[diversifying_in_undervalued_sectors | Diversify sectorally]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:20">[01:40:20]</a>. Avoid sectors highly sensitive to economic cycles or drops in returns, such as automotive, banking, insurance, construction, and transportation (e.g., airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:24">[01:40:24]</a>, [01:43:36]. Raw material and energy companies may also suffer, depending on the specific situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:52">[01:49:52]</a>. Gold is not a safe haven in these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:06">[01:50:06]</a>.

### Opportunities in Current Market Conditions

Despite the challenges, current market conditions offer opportunities:
*   **European Valuations** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:09">[02:13:09]</a>: European markets have fallen significantly, with valuations reaching levels seen during the 2020 confinement or even the 2008 crisis for individual shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:14:13">[02:14:13]</a>, [02:16:04].
*   **US Market (Excluding Top 10 Stocks)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:23">[02:50:23]</a>: If the 10 largest US stocks (Microsoft, Google, Apple, Facebook, etc.) are excluded, the remaining 490 S&P 500 companies are trading below their historical average, making them about 10% cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:19">[02:54:19]</a>, [02:56:06].
*   **Rapid Reversals** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:50">[02:18:50]</a>: Historically, the worse the market situation, the faster it tends to rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:46">[02:19:46]</a>. Drops in corporate profits typically reverse quickly, leading to strong market recoveries within 1-2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:28">[02:28:28]</a>, [02:35:05].

When investor sentiment is low and expectations are minimal, it is generally the most opportune time to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>, [02:48:46].

### Key Factors for Investment Success

Successful investing, as explained by François Rosón, a highly successful Canadian fund manager, focuses on:
*   **Future Earnings** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:09">[03:13:09]</a>: The secret to successful investing is accurately predicting a company's earnings in 5-10 years and investing only in those where you have strong conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:19">[03:14:19]</a>. This involves understanding market size and growth, company market share, reinvestment strategies, and the sustainability of profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>, [03:39:07].
*   **Value Growth Formula** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>: A company's value increases based on its growth in profits, shareholder profitability (dividends), and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:16">[03:52:16]</a>. This formula shows that in the long term, the stock market respects this combination, and consistent profit growth is the biggest component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:17">[03:46:17]</a>, [04:13:14].
*   **Understanding Business Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:24:26">[04:24:26]</a>: Focus on analyzing how a business works, its competitive advantages, and key performance indicators. This qualitative understanding is more crucial than precise valuation multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:42:04">[04:42:04]</a>, [04:46:27].
*   **Avoiding "Errors of Omission"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:30">[04:51:30]</a>: These are mistakes where investors fail to buy a stock that subsequently performs well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:51:50">[04:51:50]</a>. If a company is good and its valuation is reasonable, buy it even if it has seen a slight price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:08:08">[05:08:08]</a>, [05:10:48]. The focus should be on long-term growth potential, not short-term price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:55">[05:14:55]</a>.
*   **Investing in Strong Sectors** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:17:41">[05:17:41]</a>: Seek companies in sectors with "tailwind" or favorable conditions. This increases the probability of positive returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:18:29">[05:18:29]</a>, [05:20:50]. For example, the low-cost dollar stores like Dollar General and Dollar Tree have thrived due to their resistant business model even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:58">[05:58:58]</a>, [05:59:00].
*   **Long-Term Horizon** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:31">[03:11:31]</a>: Stock market performance in a single year or two does not necessarily reflect the long-term potential of a company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:48">[03:47:48]</a>, [03:51:00].
*   **Avoiding Stop-Loss Orders** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:56:56">[06:56:56]</a>: Professional investors generally do not use stop-loss orders. A price drop in a good investment should theoretically make it a better buy, unless the fundamentals have changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:58:58">[06:58:58]</a>, [07:37:05].

### Examples of Successful Investments

François Rosón's portfolio highlights several types of quality companies that have delivered strong returns:
*   **Discount Retailers (e.g., Five Below)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:52:16">[05:52:16]</a>: These businesses generate traffic with branded products sold cheaply and profit from impulse buys of unbranded Chinese goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:55:57">[05:55:57]</a>. They have a competitive advantage due to scale, density of stores, and inventory management expertise, making them resistant to online competition due to shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:07">[05:56:07]</a>, [05:56:20].
*   **Low-Cost Insurers (e.g., Progressive, Geico)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:07:07">[06:07:07]</a>: In the insurance sector, the key competitive advantage is having the lowest costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:10">[06:10:10]</a>. Insurers benefit from "float" (premiums paid in advance which can be invested) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:24">[06:24:24]</a>, [06:28:28]. Auto insurers are non-cyclical because car insurance is mandatory, and sales are not significantly affected by crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:18:16">[06:18:16]</a>, [06:21:55].
*   **Professionalized Niche Markets (e.g., CarMax)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:41:09">[07:41:09]</a>: CarMax professionalized the used car sales sector in the US by offering transparent, fixed pricing and good service, addressing consumer fears of being cheated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>, [08:18:56]. Their competitive advantage comes from scale and brand trust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:15">[08:19:15]</a>.

### Avoiding Risky Business Models

*   **Cyclical Companies with Debt** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>: Companies with high debt that are also sensitive to economic cycles tend to suffer significantly during downturns.
*   **Multi-Level Marketing (MLM) / Pyramid Sales Models** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:25">[07:25:25]</a>: Businesses like Herbalife or Avon Products can experience explosive growth initially but often face long-term stagnation or decline once the growth of new participants slows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:45">[07:34:45]</a>, [07:48:47]. Their profitability is often tied to the recruitment of new members rather than sustainable product sales, making them high-risk in the long run <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:35:34">[07:35:34]</a>, [07:39:50].

It is crucial to understand the risks involved in any investment and to perform thorough analysis, even if it means missing out on some quick gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:26">[07:45:26]</a>.

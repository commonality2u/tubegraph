Many individuals ponder if it's possible to live off the stock market and achieve a predictable, increasing income over time. The answer is affirmative, but with specific nuances, particularly concerning the method of generating income from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Ways to Make Money from Stocks

There are primarily two ways to make money from stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

1.  **Revaluation**: This common method involves buying a stock with the intention of selling it at a higher price in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The challenge with this approach is its reliance on other investors being willing to pay more for your stocks later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>, leading to less predictable and more volatile results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>.
2.  **Dividends**: This method allows for a much more predictable income stream from the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Certain companies regularly distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The advantage here is that income doesn't depend on future buyers; instead, it relies on correctly [[analyzing_company_fundamentals_for_investment | analyzing the company]] and its ability to generate stable and growing profits that can be distributed as dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This approach provides more predictable income over time, aiding in reaching profitability targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Finding High-Dividend Stocks with Tools

To effectively find high-dividend stocks that align with investment goals, several free tools can be utilized.

### Investing.com Stock Screener
This tool allows investors to [[using_investment_screens_and_research | search for shares]] from specific countries that meet minimum dividend profitability objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:00:00">[04:00:00]</a>.

*   **Dividend Yield Filter**: It is advisable to set this filter between 6% and 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:11:00">[04:11:00]</a>. Dividends above 10% are often unsustainable, while those below require significantly more capital to reach daily profitability objectives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:16:00">[04:16:00]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth Filter**: This filter helps assess the historical evolution of a company's dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.
    *   **Low Range**: Limit to 0% to avoid companies that have historically reduced their dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>.
    *   **Top Range**: Limit to 10% average annual dividend growth, as aggressive growth paired with high profitability per dividend is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:41:00">[04:41:00]</a>.

Applying these filters can reveal interesting companies like AT&T (telecommunications), Las Vegas Sands (casino), and Iron Mountain (document storage) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:56:00">[04:56:00]</a>. This filter can also be applied to various global markets, including Spain, Europe, Latin America, and Canada, revealing companies such as Pixar Royalties and Dicker (nursing home company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:13:00">[05:13:00]</a>.

### Seeking Alpha (Si Kim Alfa Dot Com)
This website is useful for [[analyzing_company_fundamentals_for_investment | researching dividend stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>. By searching for a company's ticker (e.g., MO for Altria) and navigating to the "dividends" section, then "dividend growth," one can observe how the company has grown its dividends over time, such as Altria's average 10% annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:15:00">[09:15:15]</a>.

### Market Screener
Another valuable tool for [[analyzing_company_fundamentals_for_investment | researching dividend stocks]] is Market Screener <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. In its finance section, investors can view the expected dividend payment for the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. It's crucial to monitor that this payment is at least stable or growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:31:00">[09:31:00]</a>.

## Portfolio Construction and Diversification

Academic studies suggest that an investment portfolio should be diversified across at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. Additionally, it is advisable for a portfolio seeking specific profitability objectives to contain between 15 and 20 shares that meet dividend criteria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:00">[02:35:00]</a>. This diversification helps balance performance, as some shares may exceed dividend expectations while others may fall short <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. The focus should remain on the dividends a company is expected to pay in the future, rather than solely on stock market price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

Companies typically don't distribute 100% of their profits as dividends; a portion is reinvested to foster future business growth, potentially leading to future revaluation over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.

### Calculating Required Capital
To estimate the capital needed to achieve a target average daily profitability (e.g., $100/€100 per day, equivalent to $36,000 annually), a simple formula can be used <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:39:00">[05:39:00]</a>:

*   **Formula**: (1 / Expected Portfolio Profitability) \* Annual Benefit Target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:42:00">[06:42:00]</a>.
*   **Example**: For a 7% average dividend yield portfolio and a $36,000 annual target: (1 / 0.07) \* $36,000 ≈ 14.28 \* $36,000 = $514,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.
    *   This calculation shows approximately $504,000 would be needed to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.
*   **Adjustments**: Increasing the portfolio's profitability or decreasing the daily performance expectation (e.g., to $50) would reduce the required capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

A realistic dividend yield objective for a diversified portfolio is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. While some companies offer lower, safer yields (3-4%) requiring more capital, others might offer very high yields (10-12%) which are often unstable and prone to cuts during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a>. The ideal approach is to build a portfolio with an average yield around 7%, comprised of 15-20 diversified stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>.

*   **Fundamentals**: Electricity consumption is constant and increasing, making it a crisis-resistant sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. Despite recent government regulatory changes causing panic and a temporary stock drop, the long-term effect is expected to be minimal, making shares trade at a discount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>.

### National Health Investors (NHI)
*   **Ticker/Price**: NHI (US), ~$66 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:35:00">[15:35:00]</a>.
*   **Sector**: Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) owning housing and residences for the elderly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:59:00">[15:59:00]</a>.

Funds From Operations (FFO), a key metric for REITs representing real profit-generating capacity, increased by 3% in the first nine months of 2020 compared to 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:36:00">[16:36:00]</a>. Trading below its historical valuation average, suggesting potential for future revaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

## Taxation of Dividends

Dividends are typically taxed between 20% and 25% in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:25:00">[17:25:00]</a>. Receiving dividends from outside one's country of tax residence can lead to a "withholding tax" or double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a>. In the United States, the W8BN form, often provided by brokers like Interactive Brokers, can help avoid this double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a>.

Howard Marks is considered one of the investors with the most common sense, capable of clearly explaining market situations and possessing a highly accurate vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Warren Buffett himself holds Marks's insights in high regard, stating that he stops whatever he is doing to read Marks's memos to his investors, as they "always brings him something new" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

Marks's investment fund manager, Oaktree Capital (mispronounced as "Opti" and "Play Maps" in the transcript), has amassed approximately 160 trillion in assets, consistently generating solid, predictable double-digit returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:31">[00:04:31]</a>. It is now considered the largest investment fund globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Transcendental Changes in Investing

In his 53 years of investing experience, Howard Marks has observed numerous bubbles, speculative fevers, and economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. However, he identifies only two prior "transcendental changes" that fundamentally altered the market's structure and what investment approaches worked for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>. He now believes that the market is experiencing a third such change in 50 years, which will have significant implications for future [[investment strategies and philosophies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

## Past Strategies (Last 13 Years) and the New Paradigm

Marks contends that the [[investment strategies of successful investors | strategies]] that proved effective during the last 13 years, coinciding with the easy money era from central bank money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>, will no longer be successful in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:48">[00:06:48]</a>. This shift is characterized by the withdrawal of liquidity from the system, which began in March with a monthly withdrawal of $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>, effectively reversing previous actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:01">[00:02:01]</a>.

He highlights four key strategies that flourished in the preceding 13 years:

1.  **Rise of Passive or Indexed Investment**: There was a massive inflow of capital into passive investment strategies, while active investment experienced significant outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. This was fueled by easy money and a market where "the entire market was going up," creating a "self-fulfilling prophecy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.
2.  **Growth Investment Style**: The market favored "growth" companies, often those that were not profitable and financed losses by issuing shares, peaking around 2021 with companies like Peloton, Palantir, and Shopify <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>. Marks notes that this unsustainable growth contrasts with [[investment strategies of legendary investors | value investing]], which focuses on profitable, sensible businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>.
3.  **Large-Cap Outperformance over Small Caps**: Historically, small-cap companies provided higher returns due to less analyst coverage, lower liquidity, and greater growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. However, in the last 13 years, large-cap indices like the S&P 500 significantly outperformed small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">[00:12:18]</a>.
4.  **United States Stocks Outperforming the Rest of the World**: U.S. stocks, particularly "FAANG" companies, have performed exceptionally well, attracting significant capital and driving indices higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:31">[00:32:31]</a>.

## New Investment Environment and Opportunities

Howard Marks suggests that the new paradigm will see a reversal of these trends, with international stocks, small-cap companies, and value stocks potentially outperforming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:40">[00:33:40]</a>. He emphasizes the importance of adaptability and consistency with market changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

He highlights that current market conditions are creating "very interesting situations" where businesses with strong fundamentals are trading at low valuations due to broader market fears and liquidity withdrawals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. This presents a "good breeding ground for the future" for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:18">[00:57:18]</a>. Marks advises against generalizing market segments and instead encourages individual analysis of companies, focusing on their future prospects, debt, management team, and valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:41:40">[01:41:40]</a>.

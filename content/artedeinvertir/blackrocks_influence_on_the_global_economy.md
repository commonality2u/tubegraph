BlackRock is commonly described as the "owner of the world" due to its immense financial power and control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This mysterious company controls over $10 trillion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. These assets represent more than 10% of the world economy, making BlackRock larger than all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Many sources accuse BlackRock of using its power and control over companies to contribute to environmental damage, social inequality, or financial fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is highly probable that parts of an individual's savings are directly or indirectly managed by this company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Leadership and Objectives

BlackRock is led by Larry Fink, its enigmatic CEO, who is considered one of the most economically powerful individuals globally, yet remains largely unknown to most people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. As a private company, BlackRock's primary objective is to generate profits from the funds provided by its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Client Base and [[blackrocks_control_over_listed_companies_and_banks | Control Over the Financial Sector]]

The majority of BlackRock's clients consist of banks, insurers, pension plans, and sovereign wealth funds from some of the world's wealthiest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. Importantly, small investors also constitute a main client base <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

BlackRock exerts significant [[blackrocks_control_over_listed_companies_and_banks | control over the financial sector]], which is often considered the "lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. With its vast funds, it holds majority positions in leading global banks such as Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. Paradoxically, many of these same banks are BlackRock's main clients, annually providing more funds, thereby increasing BlackRock's controlling stake over major global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. It's likely that money from common bank investment plans or even deposited funds ends up in BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>.

### iShares and Market Presence

BlackRock uses "iShares" as its commercial name to channel investments and acquire ownership in companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>. A simple check of major listed companies' shareholders on platforms like Yahoo Finance often reveals BlackRock or iShares among the top holders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. This pattern is also visible in popular investment funds offered by banks to retail clients, where iShares products are prominent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">[00:03:06]</a>. This creates a circular structure: a company owning and controlling a bank's board receives more money from the bank's clients, which then allows BlackRock to buy more shares of that bank, further increasing its ownership, power, and profits globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

### BlackRock Solutions and [[ethical_and_competitive_concerns_related_to_blackrocks_power | Conflicts of Interest]]

BlackRock has a controversial division called BlackRock Solutions, which audits and controls potential risks that major banks globally may pose to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This gives BlackRock access to intimate internal accounts and data of these banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This situation is curious given that BlackRock is simultaneously a main investor in these banks and is in charge of assessing their internal risk, akin to self-auditing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. BlackRock claims these are entirely separate companies with "Chinese walls" for information control, but many question the veracity of this claim <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>.

This accumulation of power also generates potential [[ethical_and_competitive_concerns_related_to_blackrocks_power | conflicts of interest]] regarding competition between different companies controlled by BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. For example, while BlackRock may not directly appear as a main shareholder in McDonald's, it is listed among the main shareholders of McDonald's competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This means the same company controls major players within a single sector, raising questions about competition freedom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This trend is observed across various sectors, including automotive, airline, and finance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>.

## BlackRock's [[impact_on_global_financial_markets | Impact on Global Financial Markets]] and Economies

BlackRock's influence is so significant that during the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve commissioned BlackRock to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Its power extends beyond rich economies like the United States and Europe, as it is also a major lender to emerging countries, exercising control over these regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

As of a 202 CNN news story, BlackRock and Vanguard collectively controlled over $15 trillion in assets, rivaling the American economy's $23 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>. These two companies are the primary shareholders of 85% of the main listed companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Influence on Public Opinion and Corporate Behavior

BlackRock also wields power in the media sector, which is crucial for shaping public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It is estimated that they control 95% of traditional or new-generation media, such as Facebook, where they are among the largest shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

In 2021, BlackRock leveraged its power to exert pressure on companies like ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, to reduce its CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. ExxonMobil subsequently admitted it expects to achieve net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Passive Investment Trend and [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | Potential Risks]]

BlackRock's business model largely revolves around advising on financial products like iShares ETFs, which account for 80% of its income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These ETFs are designed to be easily bought and sold, creating a new category for the general public to invest simply in the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It's estimated that 60% of invested money in the United States is already passive, flowing into products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

A significant concern arising from this investment style is the question of who truly controls companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Investors who purchase BlackRock products effectively delegate their voting rights over the underlying companies to BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This leads to power concentration in very few companies, which in turn control major global corporations listed on the stock exchange <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.

### The "Passive Investment Bubble" Warning

Large investors like Michael Burry, who famously predicted the 2008 financial crisis, have warned that passive investing and these ETFs represent a "huge bubble" due to the high valuations many companies are reaching, regardless of their intrinsic quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>. The mechanism of these ETFs forces automated buying of stocks that rise and gain relative weight within an index, further inflating valuations and attracting more passive capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>.

Burry suggests that this investment style's "music will stop playing" when capital outflows exceed inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The larger the "bubble," the more new money is required to maintain high valuations, likening it to a game of musical chairs where those left without a chair will lose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

## Investing in BlackRock

BlackRock itself is publicly listed on the stock market under the ticker BLK, trading at around $700 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Since its listing in 2000, BlackRock shares have increased by over 50 times, enriching many shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. BlackRock anticipates continued annual growth of 15% through 2025, a rate significantly higher than the average for listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. The company has returned over 75% of its earnings to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Its dividends have increased at an average rate of 18% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Inflation's Effect on BlackRock

Inflation could have a neutral or even positive effect on BlackRock's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. BlackRock charges a percentage on the value of its listed ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. If the nominal value of these ETFs increases due to inflation, BlackRock's commissions will be higher while its costs remain relatively stable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:32">[00:10:32]</a>. In environments of extreme inflation, stock markets tend to rise exponentially, which would benefit BlackRock's commission structure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:48">[00:10:48]</a>.

## Advice for Investors

It is crucial for investors to take full responsibility for their investments, understanding where their money is invested, the commissions paid, and the expected risks and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Understanding the financial system can be complex, making continuous education key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. Personal belief suggests that individual stock selection will gain importance in the future, as the market will present discrepancies between undervalued companies not benefiting from indices and overvalued companies that will perform worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:41">[00:12:41]</a>.

In a market environment where caution is advised, especially given potential economic issues in 2025, it's crucial to identify individual companies that offer strong [[investment_strategies_for_longterm_growth | investment opportunities]] despite broader market trends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. While the overall market may appear expensive, there are many alternatives in [[opportunities_in_lesserknown_and_undervalued_companies | lesser-known companies]] at very attractive valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:45">[00:25:45]</a>. The focus should be on [[understanding_companies_before_investing | understanding companies]] with stable, predictable businesses and strong management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:54">[00:25:54]</a>.

Many opportunities exist outside the top 10 or even top 50 most well-known stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:08">[00:26:08]</a>, especially as large, famous companies are often the most expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>.

## Featured Companies

### Uber
Uber is one of the few large technology companies that has not seen significant market appreciation in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:48">[00:26:48]</a>.

*   **Growth:** The company is growing at a rate of almost 20% per year, with EBITDA growing even faster at 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:21">[00:28:21]</a>. This includes its significant transportation of goods platform (Uber Eats) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:42">[00:28:42]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Uber's current valuation is 19 times earnings, which is nearly half of its historical average of 36 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:31">[00:29:31]</a>.

### Capgemini
A European stock in the IT services sector, Capgemini, has seen a correction due to European political instability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:59">[00:29:59]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** It's an exporting company with majority services outside France, providing high value-added, recurrent IT services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:10">[00:30:10]</a>. This service-based model is free from tariffs that affect physical products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:17">[00:30:17]</a>.
*   **AI Beneficiary:** Companies like Capgemini are poised to benefit significantly from artificial intelligence, as they are the ones building and updating AI solutions for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:26">[00:31:26]</a>.
*   **Performance & Valuation:** While 2024 has seen a slight decrease in activity (2%), Capgemini continues to generate significant profits ($2 billion Cash Flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>. It is currently trading at 13 times cash flow, well below its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:21">[00:33:21]</a>. The IT spending forecast for 2025 shows acceleration, indicating strong future demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:40">[00:35:40]</a>.

### Jackson Financial
An example of [[investment_opportunities_outside_the_tech_sector | investment opportunities outside the tech sector]], Jackson Financial specializes in variable annuities, which are similar to pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:45">[00:42:45]</a>.
*   **Business Model:** It's a highly recurring business where clients commit money for long-term regular payments, allowing Jackson to charge a recurring percentage on the capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:49">[00:44:49]</a>. These investments also offer tax benefits in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:06">[00:45:06]</a>.
*   **Financial Health:** The company is highly regulated, ensuring security for investors, and maintains a strong capital ratio of 500% (well above regulatory requirements) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:04">[00:47:04]</a>.
*   **Valuation & Shareholder Returns:** Jackson Financial generates a high Return on Equity (ROE) of 20%, but trades at only 0.8 times book value and 5 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:57">[00:48:05]</a>. The average for the financial sector is 10-12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:39">[00:48:39]</a>. In 2024, the company returned almost $600 million to shareholders through buybacks and dividends, nearly 10% of its market capitalization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:49:05]</a>.

### Dollar General
This discount retail company recently faced difficulties, but its business is stabilizing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:11">[00:51:11]</a>.
*   **Recovery & Growth:** After experiencing a growth slowdown (2.2%), Dollar General is expected to return to 4-5% growth and gradually recover margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:42">[00:51:42]</a>.

### Teleperformance
Teleperformance, a global leader in customer experience management, recently made an acquisition (Interpreta) that appears to be sensible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:48">[00:52:48]</a>.
*   **Acquisition Value:** The acquisition was made at approximately 7 times EBITDA, and the acquired business operates in a high-margin, niche market (real-time interpretation services for deaf people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>.
*   **AI Resilience:** Despite concerns that AI might impact the business, existing services like Language Line (a previous acquisition) continue to grow at double-digit rates, demonstrating resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:34">[00:54:43]</a>.

### Gois (Canadian Lender)
This Canadian lending company has maintained strong growth despite a negative market narrative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:23">[00:55:23]</a>.
*   **Consistent Growth:** It continues to grow at a high level, with 23% profit growth in 2023, and expected growth of 17-18% this year and 20% next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:02">[00:57:02]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage:** The weakness in the Canadian economy benefits Gois by expelling weaker competitors, allowing it to gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** It trades at eight times earnings, which is a much lower valuation compared to a technology company with similar growth rates, despite its average historical valuation being 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:16">[00:57:29]</a>.

### Johnson & Johnson
A "blue chip" company, Johnson & Johnson is a well-established, lifetime business that has seen a correction due to a lack of interest in "boring" companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:12">[00:58:12]</a>.
*   **Stability & Growth:** Despite a sales drop due to a spinoff, the underlying business did not decrease and is expected to grow 4% this year and 3% next year, aligning with global economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:26">[00:58:44]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** The stock is currently in its lowest price range of the last 10 years, trading at 13 or 14 times earnings, compared to its historical maximum of 18-20 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:21">[00:59:29]</a>.

### Google (Alphabet)
Among the "Magnificent Seven" tech giants, Google (Alphabet) stands out for its relatively lower valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:51">[00:59:55]</a>.
*   **Growth & Assets:** It offers similar or better growth than its peers and possesses significant "hidden assets" such as Waymo (self-driving technology), Android (under-monetized), and extensive data for training AI models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:58">[01:00:10]</a>.

### Tinexta
A small Italian company, Tinexta, has experienced a slowdown due to political uncertainty in France affecting its consulting services division <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:30">[01:00:41]</a>.
*   **Growth Trajectory:** Despite the temporary slowdown, the business is expected to grow 17% from 2023 to 2024 and 11% next year, with EBITDA projected to increase significantly once the situation normalizes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:01:07]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Its valuation has collapsed to six times normalized earnings, similar to its cheap valuation in 2016, despite its predictable growth history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:19">[01:01:31]</a>.

### Volkswagen / Mercedes
These automotive companies are currently experiencing negativity in the market, with Volkswagen at a P/E ratio of 5 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:17">[01:04:19]</a>.
*   **Market Impact:** The industry is affected by high interest rates, as 60-70% of car sales are financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:37">[01:04:45]</a>. However, interest rates are expected to decrease, which should reactivate demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:51">[01:04:54]</a>.
*   **Recovery Potential:** While Mercedes' profits have decreased, they are expected to recover gradually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:14">[01:05:23]</a>. The impact of Chinese manufacturers entering Europe with low prices is also a factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:27">[01:05:32]</a>.

Taylor's Rule is a guideline used by central bankers, though not a strict written rule, to determine appropriate interest rates in an economy. It was developed by John Taylor in 1992 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. The rule aims to stabilize inflation while not harming economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. Historically, it has demonstrated excellent predictive capacity for interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>.

## What is Taylor's Rule?
At its core, Taylor's Rule is a mathematical formula that suggests what the nominal interest rate should be, based on deviations of actual inflation from its target and actual GDP growth from its potential. Central bankers, including Jerome Powell and other Fed presidents, are known to be guided by this formula <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>.

## How it Works
The target rate formula for Taylor's Rule requires five parameters to be filled into a calculator <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>:
1.  **Neutral Rate:** This is a long-term neutral rate, often the average of the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>.
2.  **Desired Inflation Rate:** The target inflation rate for the future. It should preferably be superior to situations that would lead to real negative performance, which can indicate bubbles (as seen currently when real rates turn negative, causing the stock market to do extraordinarily well) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. Bankers aim for a balanced approach to avoid large bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>. For example, if future inflation is expected to be 2.5-3%, the desired rate should be at least 3-3.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
3.  **Expected GDP Growth:** The anticipated growth rate of the Gross Domestic Product <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.
4.  **Current GDP Growth:** The actual GDP growth rate at the present time. Despite recent negative quarters, the economy might still be growing at 2.5-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
5.  **Current Inflation Rate:** The present inflation rate. For instance, if current inflation is 8%, the rule would suggest very high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. However, one might input an *expected* stabilized inflation rate for the next 6-12 months or the long-term objective of central bankers (e.g., 2%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.

An online calculator for Taylor's Rule is available on the "Educated website" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

## Historical Performance
Taylor's Rule has shown a very high correlation with how central banks ought to set interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. Historically, it has suggested very high interest rates in periods like 1972 (17%) and 1982 (12%), which aligned well with actual rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:31">[00:07:31]</a>. Conversely, there have been times when it suggested lower rates, around 4% or 5%, when actual rates were higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>.

## Current Implications
With inflation remaining a significant concern <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>, Warren Buffett has warned that inflation may last longer than expected and that the economy is quite overheated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. This environment has led to a focus on what central banks will do, with expectations of multiple interest rate hikes in upcoming months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The speaker highlights that, given the current inflation, Taylor's Rule would suggest interest rates should be almost at 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

This implies that while there's much anxiety around central bank messages, investors should focus on underlying company fundamentals rather than trying to predict market movements based on short-term news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Warren Buffett advises against holding cash, gold, or Bitcoin in this situation, stating that stocks are the safest long-term bet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. This is because stocks, particularly those of quality businesses, are expected to better resist inflation and even provide excess returns above it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

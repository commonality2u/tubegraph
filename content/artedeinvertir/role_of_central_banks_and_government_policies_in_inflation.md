The recent decisions of [[impact_of_central_bank_policies_on_economic_conditions | central banks]] and governments are seen as accelerating a new market phenomenon known as the "reverse crisis" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. This scenario, increasingly possible, is closely linked to [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] and the policy choices made by these entities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Monetary Expansion and Currency Devaluation

[[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | The Federal Reserve]] and other [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | central banks]] have been "flooding the financial system" with new currency, including euros, dollars, and pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Since 2008, the approach to financial crises has consistently been to print new money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, in 2020, 22% of all dollars currently in circulation were printed in a single year, despite the currency having 200 years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

## Government Fiscal Deficits

Governments have developed a habit of spending more money than they collect through taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This leads to increased borrowing and debt, which can weaken a currency and contribute to [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The United States deficit, for instance, stands at 8%, a level comparable to the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

Investor Warren Buffett highlighted this issue in his 2024 annual letter to investors, stating that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>.

## Creation of Inflation Crises

The combination of monetary expansion and fiscal deficits has contributed to one of the largest [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] crises in the last 40 years, fundamentally transforming the economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

This process has already begun, with accumulated [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] reaching 20% from 2021 to the present, largely due to the policies of governments and [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | central banks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

## Negative Real Interest Rates

These inflationary processes are closely linked to negative real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>. This occurs when the level of [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] surpasses the [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rate]] set by a country's [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | central bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

Examples include:
*   **Argentina:** Over the past 12 years, Argentina has experienced an average negative real [[role_of_interest_rates_and_inflation_in_investments | interest rate]] of at least 6%, leading to one of the worst [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] crises in its history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   **Europe and the United States:** Both regions made the same mistake in 2021 and 2022, experiencing negative real rates of 3% to 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

## Future Concerns

A significant concern among many large investors, including Warren Buffett, is the potential for a second wave of [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] at a higher level than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Apollo Group's study suggests that [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] tends to move in waves, and when the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements | Fed]] lowers rates, it tends to raise [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]], a pattern observed in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. According to this study, a new increase in [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] and negative real [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | interest rates]] could occur within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>.

This risk is compounded by [[the_role_of_central_banks_in_controlling_inflation | central banks']][[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | plans to reduce interest rates]] while governments continue to avoid tackling fiscal deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Warren Buffett has warned that "extreme [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] is always a possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

Global debt has reached unprecedented levels, particularly exacerbated by the 2020 crisis, leading to serious potential consequences for the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Prominent investors like Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio have issued warnings about this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Understanding the current debt landscape and adopting proactive [[investment_strategies_for_economic_crises | investment strategies]] are crucial for individuals and investors to protect or even benefit from this new financial situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Alarming State of Global Debt

Global debt, including corporate, government, and individual/family debt, has rapidly grown to alarming levels in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>.
Key figures from the Institute of International Finance highlight the severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>:
*   **Total Global Debt:** $270 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>
*   **Global Gross Domestic Product (GDP):** $80 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>
This equates to every person on Earth owing over $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 2020 crisis further worsened these debt levels, pushing them to record highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stated that when a government's debt exceeds 77% of its GDP, it leads to serious consequences for its future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Most developed countries, including Spain, Europe, and the USA, have already surpassed this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This record debt exists in a situation of historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

### The Problem with Zero Interest Rates

The last five years have seen an unusual phenomenon of negative interest rates, something that has occurred only once in the past 300 years of economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>. Central banks have adopted a "path of no return," where the solution to previous crises was to lower rates. However, with rates at zero, they can no longer be lowered, raising concerns about how future crises will be managed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>.

In this "world upside down," people are effectively paying to lend money. For example, German 10-year bonds have a negative yield of 0.6% per year, meaning a guaranteed loss if held to maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Despite this, demand for these debt bonds in dollars and euros is extremely high, with trillions flowing into the market daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This demand is driven by speculation: if the negative yield becomes even more negative, the bond's price on the stock market will rise, allowing for a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. This scenario is described as "stratospheric speculation" in the debt market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

The debt market is significantly larger than the stock market; in the US, the debt market is estimated at $40 trillion, compared to $20 trillion for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Daily trading volume in debt is around $700 million, versus $200 billion for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Consequently, developments in the debt market will have a major impact on stocks and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

### Warnings from Ray Dalio

Ray Dalio, who manages the world's largest investment fund, warns that the world will be very different in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He emphasizes that once interest rates reach 0%, asset prices cannot receive an additional push, and traditional economic stimulus tools used by central banks will no longer work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Dalio suggests that if the debt market begins to fall, market participants will perceive problems, causing credit to stop flowing, which will initiate difficulties for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Debt crises are often triggered by aggressive rises in interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. The massive amount of new money issued by central banks to finance the 2020 crisis problems typically causes inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Inflation is the primary variable central banks monitor to raise interest rates and balance the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Therefore, the appearance of inflation in the future, likely due to money printing, could trigger a fall in the debt market, making inflation monitoring critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Strategies for Individuals

### Managing Debts

For individuals with long-term debts, it is ideal to secure a fixed rate to lock in today's low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If inflation occurs, the value of assets like homes will rise, but fixed-rate debt costs will remain the same, proving to be a good financial operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

For short-term debts with high interest rates (e.g., credit cards with 25-30% annual interest), refinancing options like personal loans at much lower rates (e.g., 8-12%) are advisable, especially in the current low-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Saving

Saving is a universal piece of advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When credit flow stops, liquidity becomes the most valuable asset, enabling investments at unprecedented low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

## [[Strategies for protecting investments during economic downturns | Investment Strategies]]

### 1. Avoid Highly Indebted Companies

Avoid investing in companies with high debt levels, especially cyclical businesses like banks, construction companies, or airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. If interest rates rise, these companies will face increased costs and could go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. While some believe banks benefit from rising rates, increased delinquency rates can offset this, as borrowers may fail to meet loan obligations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. [[warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] has started reducing his investments in the banking sector due to this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

*   **How to check debt levels:** Consult a company's annual report (specifically the financial balance sheet) on its website, or use financial websites like `marketscreener.com` in the finance section <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

### 2. Avoid Investing Using Debt and Accumulate Liquidity

It is crucial to avoid investing using debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. When economic cycles turn and opportunities emerge, credit will only be available to investors with solvent portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>. This is when strategic debt can be used to capitalize on market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.

[[warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] has recently accumulated record levels of liquidity in his holding company, Berkshire Hathaway, reaching an impressive $140 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This strategic accumulation of cash demonstrates the value of liquidity for when problems arise in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### 3. Invest in Companies with Strong Liquidity, Attractive Valuation, and High Growth Potential

Look for companies that possess:
*   **Good liquidity:** Ample cash reserves and low debt.
*   **Attractive valuation:** Priced favorably relative to earnings potential.
*   **High growth potential:** Ability to grow through acquisitions or resilient business models.

Companies that grow by making acquisitions, like Berkshire Hathaway, are well-positioned for crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. During a crisis, more companies become available for acquisition, and competition for these acquisitions decreases as credit becomes harder to obtain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Companies with significant liquidity can then make the best acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. [[warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] has consistently followed this pattern during past crises (e.g., 2000, 2002, 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

### 4. Investing Against Bonds (High Risk)

An additional, high-risk strategy is to invest against bonds or debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This requires significant experience and is complicated for the average investor due to minimum operation size and market opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>. However, inverse debt ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) can facilitate this. For example:
*   **US Debt Bond:** Proshares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (ticker: `TVEFE`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Its performance has generally not been good, as high maintenance costs limit benefits if the debt market doesn't fall quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
*   **European Debt Market:** iShares € Govt Bond 20yr+ UCITS ETF (ticker: `XSV`) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Similarly, its past performance has not been satisfactory during this bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities in Stocks

The following companies meet the criteria of strong liquidity, attractive valuation, and growth potential, and could perform well even without a debt crisis.

### 1. Cisco Systems (NASDAQ: CSCO)

*   **Overview:** A leading company in technological infrastructure manufacturing and distribution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>. Its sales are stable and resistant to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>.
*   **Financial Strength:** Possesses great liquidity and is debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. Projected to end 2021 with over $17 trillion in debt-free liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>, useful for acquisitions, business investment, or share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Expected to earn around $3 per share in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. As a mature company with limited growth potential, earnings per share could rise to $4 in three to five years, leading to a target price of $60 per share (based on a P/E of 15) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. While the potential for realization is somewhat limited, it offers a crisis-resistant company with significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.

### 2. Constellation Software (TSX: CSU)

*   **Overview:** One of the best technology stocks, having multiplied by over 80 times on the stock market in the last 12 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>, with an average annual return over 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   **Crisis Resilience:** It has three perfect characteristics for a debt crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:02">[00:15:02]</a>:
    1.  Large amount of liquidity on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
    2.  Grows through acquisitions, meaning more abundant and attractively priced acquisitions during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
    3.  Very resilient business model that ensures acquired businesses perform well even in economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.
*   **Performance during 2008 Crisis:** Its income grew from $200 million to over $700 million between 2006 and 2011, with spectacular growth rates even in the most difficult years (2008-2010) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Gross profit also doubled during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** While its future growth rate is expected to be lower than in the past, it could still average 15% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. At its current reasonable market valuation, shares could reach $3,000, offering an average annual return of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:37">[00:16:37]</a>. This is very interesting for such a safe and stable company, with potential for additional upside if a debt crisis appears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:50">[00:16:50]</a>.

### 3. Oracle (NYSE: ORCL)

*   **Overview:** Another leading technology company, offering one of the most important business management software in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>. This guarantees predictable income, high profit margins, and a high return on equity, characteristic of good companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:50">[00:17:50]</a>.
*   **Crisis Performance:** Demonstrated excellent performance during economic crises, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>.
*   **Financial Strength:** Oracle is among the American companies with the highest level of liquidity on their balance sheets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>, alongside companies like Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** As a mature company, its earnings per share could rise to nearly $5 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Valuing it at its historical average of around 20 times earnings would yield a target price of $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Compared to its current trading price of $60, this presents an interesting potential for realization, akin to Cisco Systems, offering a predictable, highly liquid, and crisis-resistant company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:50">[00:18:50]</a>.

## Impact of the Russia-Ukraine Conflict on Markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>

The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had significant repercussions on global stock markets and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. The Russian stock market, for instance, experienced a collapse more severe than during the 2008 financial crisis or the 2020 confinement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. The Russian stock index plummeted 40% from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Other stock markets have also declined due to the escalating tensions, even before a theoretical start to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

### Economic Responses and Consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>

*   **Energy Sector:**
    *   Germany suspended the certification of the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline, which was intended to bring Russian gas to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>.
    *   This suspension caused gas prices in Europe to skyrocket, exacerbating an existing crisis in supplies and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.
    *   Rising energy costs, including oil approaching $100 per barrel (up from $50 a year prior), reduce consumer disposable income, which is critical since 70% of the economy relies on consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
    *   While oil-producing companies may benefit, the rest of the world is harmed by high energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.
    *   European gas prices are now triple what they were a year ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>.
    *   Russia's gas exports to Europe were already at a very low level in 2021 due to prior tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:34">[00:06:34]</a>.
*   **Financial Sanctions:** Western countries have threatened to exclude Russia from the SWIFT system, which would severely limit international trade in euros, pounds, and especially dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. While Russia would be the primary victim, such obstacles to global trade negatively affect all countries, as many Western companies derive a significant portion of their sales from the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Agriculture and Food Industry:**
    *   Food prices were already rising due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.
    *   Russia is a major global producer of grains and wheat, ranking fourth worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Including Ukraine, the region accounts for nearly 20% of global production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.
    *   A disruption in this supply can lead to disproportionate price increases (50-100%) in commodity markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>.
*   **Fertilizer Market:**
    *   Russia and Ukraine are significant producers of potassium, a key component in fertilizers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">[00:08:33]</a>.
    *   Disruption in this market further impacts food prices and exacerbates inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a>. Inflation is a major factor in recent stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

## Historical Stock Market Behavior During Conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>

Historically, stock markets often fall due to the anxiety and uncertainty *before* negative events occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. Once conflicts begin, markets tend to realize it's "not the end of the world" and recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

*   **"Buy with the drums of war and sell with the sound of the violin"** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>: This adage suggests that opportunities arise during times of impending conflict.
*   **Rapid Recovery:** Past conflicts like Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq (1990), and Crimea show a bullish behavior in subsequent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. For example, the invasion of Iraq in 1990 saw a 20% decline but recovered in just 180 days (six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. The Pearl Harbor attack, which caused a 20% drop, recovered in less than a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>.
*   **Market Psychology:** Markets fall *before* conflicts and recover relatively quickly because the negative events, while terrible on a human and social level, do not typically lead to the "end of the world" economically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">[00:11:57]</a>. Trade may temporarily lessen, and economic growth may slow in affected areas, but normalcy often returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:04">[00:12:04]</a>.

### Investment Performance by Style During Conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>

Studies show that buying during conflicts can lead to improved returns:

*   **Small Stocks:** Typically yield 1% to 11% annually. However, if purchased during conflicts, returns have historically been greater because assets are cheaper <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">[00:12:56]</a>.
*   **Large Stocks:** Normally offer a 10% return, but slightly higher when bought at the start of conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Bonds (Safe Investments):** While considered safer, bonds (especially those over 5 or 10 years) tend to yield less during conflicts (around 5% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:23">[00:14:23]</a>. This is because investors flock to them when the stock market falls, driving up their price and reducing future returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>.

Knowledgeable investors benefit most during periods of fear, as sellers are willing to offer shares at lower prices due to lack of conviction or understanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:55">[00:14:55]</a>. This concept is often referred to as "shares returning to their rightful owners" during bearish periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities and Risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:32">[00:15:32]</a>

Geopolitical conflicts present both risks and opportunities in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:43">[00:15:43]</a>.

### Key Sectors to Watch <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>

*   **Defense Stocks:** Companies like Lockheed Martin, Thales, and Dassault Aviation (European) tend to rise during periods of conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.
*   **Energy Sector (e.g., Gazprom):** While Russian companies face sanction risks, some, like Gazprom, have seen their stock fall despite rising gas and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:42">[00:17:42]</a>. Russian stocks often trade at lower price-to-earnings (P/E) multiples (average 5x) compared to other markets (15-16x) due to political and expropriation risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
    *   Cyclical stocks, like those in the oil and gas sector, are often best bought when their P/E valuation is highest (indicating low raw material prices and potential for improvement) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:56">[00:20:56]</a>.
*   **Fertilizer Sector (e.g., Mosaic, Nutrien, OCI):** Companies producing fertilizers outside of Russia and Ukraine could benefit from a reduction in global supply, leading to higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:22">[00:22:22]</a>.
    *   [[investment_strategies_during_economic_volatility | Cyclical stocks]] like Mosaic have historically shown little long-term value creation and are considered "good for renting, not for investing" (speculating for short periods rather than long-term holding) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:36">[00:23:36]</a>.

### General Investment Advice During Uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:01">[00:28:01]</a>

*   **Training and Knowledge:** In situations of [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainty | market crisis]] and volatility, being trained to navigate difficult periods is crucial for making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:10">[00:29:10]</a>.
*   **Understanding Risk:** Investment in the stock market carries risks such as market risk, currency volatility, and company-specific execution risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:09">[00:17:09]</a>.
*   **Cyclicality of Assets:** Be aware that some assets, like oil, gas, and commodities, are cyclical and their prices can change very quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:05">[00:20:05]</a>.
*   **Risk Assets (e.g., Cryptocurrencies):** Cryptocurrencies are considered risky assets and tend to go down when the market enters a "risk-off" mode due to global events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. They are not typically a protection against inflation or market crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:41">[00:30:41]</a>.
*   **Averaging Down:** When good companies' shares fall due to market-wide fear, averaging down (buying more as prices drop) can be a strategy to take advantage of lower prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">[00:34:52]</a>. However, this requires strong knowledge of the company's fundamentals to avoid investing in businesses that might go bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:15">[00:35:15]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** It is important to maintain a long-term view, especially with quality growth stocks, as short-term market corrections are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:09">[00:39:09]</a>. Warren Buffett suggests that anyone not prepared to see their portfolio fall 40-50% should not be investing in individual stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.
*   **Focus on Company Fundamentals:** It is more concerning when a company's fundamentals deteriorate (bad results, slowing growth, low margins, high debt, poor shareholder remuneration) than when stock prices fall due to broader macroeconomic fears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:29">[00:38:29]</a>.

### Examples of Companies to Consider (Not Recommendations) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:26">[00:32:26]</a>

*   **Adobe:** A very good company with competitive advantages in software (PDF, Premiere, Photoshop) transitioning to a cloud-based subscription model <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:30">[00:32:30]</a>. Expected to double sales and profits in the next 4-5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:56">[00:32:56]</a>.
*   **Qiwi:** Described as "Russia's PayPal," it's a company with solid fundamentals that has seen its stock fall significantly despite increasing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">[00:26:40]</a>. It offers a high dividend yield and remunerates shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:01">[00:27:01]</a>.
*   **Future Plc:** A company that acquires traditional media outlets with strong brands and transitions them to online models, leveraging loyal audiences with high purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">[00:45:22]</a>. It exhibits high growth rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:07">[00:46:07]</a>.
*   **Humana (Humanice):** Has expanded its credit line for growth via acquisition and reduced leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:40">[00:46:40]</a>.
*   **Green Landscaping:** Announced a share buyback, indicating the company views its shares as undervalued given expected growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">[00:52:44]</a>. It has a growth model expanding beyond Sweden to the entire Nordic region <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:17">[00:53:17]</a>.
*   **Global (Globant):** A digital engineering company operating in a rapidly growing market, expected to continue growing at high rates (e.g., 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:50">[00:53:50]</a>. While its valuation may seem demanding, the market for digital engineering is massive and expanding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:39">[00:54:39]</a>.
*   **Sberbank:** One of the best Russian banks, historically with good stock market performance, also impacted by the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">[00:28:51]</a>.

In conclusion, while geopolitical conflicts introduce volatility and fear, they often create opportunities for informed investors to purchase quality assets at discounted prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:20">[00:29:20]</a>.

Global debt has reached record levels following the 2020 crisis, which could have significant implications for both the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Prominent investors such as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio have issued warnings about this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. Understanding the current financial landscape is crucial for protecting investments and even identifying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

## The Global Debt Crisis

Global aid and debt have escalated rapidly, reaching alarming levels in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. According to data from the Institute of International Finance, the total global debt—comprising corporate, government, and individual/family debt—amounts to an astounding $270 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. In contrast, the global gross domestic product (GDP) is only $80 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. This means every inhabitant of Earth owes more than $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>.

The 2020 crisis further exacerbated this situation, pushing debt levels to unprecedented highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has noted that when a government's debt surpasses 77% of its GDP, it leads to severe consequences for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. Worryingly, most developed countries, including Spain, Europe, and the USA, have already exceeded this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>.

### The Impact of Low Interest Rates

This record debt has accumulated in an environment of historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A critical question arises: what will happen when interest rates inevitably rise, increasing the cost of this immense debt for individuals, corporations, and governments? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

The past five years have seen an unusual economic phenomenon: negative interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>. This has occurred only once in the last 300 years of economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Central banks have consistently responded to crises by lowering rates, but with rates at zero, they have exhausted this tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

The situation of negative yields means people are effectively paying to lend money. For example, German 10-year bonds might have a negative yield of 0.6% per year, ensuring a loss if held to maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data=t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Despite this, demand for these debt bonds (in dollars and euros) is extremely high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>. This is due to speculation: if the negative yield becomes even more negative, the bond's price on the stock market will rise, allowing for profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This is likened to a game of "Russian roulette" where speculators aim to profit from short-term price movements rather than holding to maturity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

### Debt Market vs. Stock Market

The debt market is significantly larger than the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. In the US alone, the debt market is estimated at $40 trillion, double the stock market's $20 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. The daily volume of debt traded is approximately $700 million, compared to $200 billion for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Consequently, developments in the debt market will have a profound impact on stocks and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>.

Currently, debt with negative interest rates has reached a record $17 trillion globally, having surged since 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. Historically, crises rooted in high debt levels tend to be the most severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>. Credit functions as the "lung of the economy"; if it stops flowing, the economy falters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. This was evident in the 2008 financial crisis, which was heavily debt-driven (sub-prime mortgages), in contrast to the milder 2000 tech bubble, which did not involve significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.

### Expert Warnings

Ray Dalio, who manages one of the largest global investment funds and is known for anticipating macroeconomic events, has warned that the world will be "very different" in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. He emphasizes that once interest rates reach 0%, asset prices lose an additional upward push, and central banks' economic stimulus tools become ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. Dalio suggests that the stock market will increasingly influence the economy, rather than the other way around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If the debt market declines, global credit flows will cease, leading to economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>.

Debt crises are typically triggered by aggressive increases in interest rates, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Central banks have recently issued large amounts of new money to finance 2020 crisis-related problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. This new money usually leads to inflation, which is the primary variable central banks monitor to raise interest rates and balance the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. Therefore, the appearance of inflation in the future, likely due to money printing, could trigger a fall in the debt market, making inflation monitoring critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## [[Strategies to protect investments during financial crises | Protective Measures]]

### For Those with Debts
If you have long-term debts, it is ideal to secure them at a fixed rate to lock in current low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. In an inflationary environment, your home's value might rise, but a fixed-rate mortgage ensures your debt costs do not increase, making it a sound financial move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

For short-term debts with high interest rates (e.g., credit cards at 25-30% annually), consider refinancing to a personal loan with a much lower rate (e.g., 8-12%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### For All Individuals: Saving
Saving is crucial for everyone, regardless of investment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When credit flow ceases, liquidity becomes the most valuable asset, enabling investments at historically low prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

### [[Investment strategies to protect against economic downturns | For Investors]]

To [[investment_strategies_during_economic_crises | protect investments]] or [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | benefit from future instability]]:

1.  **Avoid Highly Indebted Companies:** If interest rates rise, these companies will struggle to meet new costs and could face bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. This risk is amplified for cyclical businesses like banks, construction companies, and airlines, which are highly sensitive to economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While some believe banks benefit from rising rates, increased delinquency (loan defaults) can offset this <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Warren Buffett has begun reducing his investment in the banking sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. You can assess a company's debt level through its annual report or financial websites like marketskinner.com <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.
2.  **Avoid Investing Using Debt:** When economic cycles turn and opportunities emerge, credit will only be available to investors with solvent portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>. At that point, it becomes advantageous to take on debt to seize market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has recently accumulated record levels of liquidity, reaching an impressive $140 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This strategic cash reserve allows for future acquisitions when problems arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.
3.  **Invest in Companies with Strong Liquidity, Attractive Valuation, and High Growth Potential:**
    *   **Strong Liquidity:** Companies with significant cash reserves (like Berkshire Hathaway) can make acquisitions during crises when other companies are vulnerable and competition is scarce due to limited credit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Warren Buffett has consistently followed this pattern during past crises (2000, 2002, 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.
4.  **Consider Investing Against Bonds/Debt (High Risk):** This strategy, though high-risk and requiring expertise, involves betting against the debt market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. For the average investor, inverse debt ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) make this accessible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
    *   For American debt bonds (20-year bond): ProShares UltraShort 20+ Year Treasury (ticker: TVEFE) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>.
    *   For European debt market: Xtrackers Inverse DAX UCITS ETF (ticker: XSV) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>.
    *   *Caution:* The performance of these ETFs has historically not been good, as high maintenance costs limit benefits if the debt market doesn't fall within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.

## Examples of Investment Opportunities

Here are three examples of companies that meet the criteria of being resistant to crises, possessing high liquidity, and having growth potential, even if a debt crisis doesn't occur:

Many prominent investors, including [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]], are cautioning about a new market situation referred to as a "reverse crisis," which is closely linked to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. This scenario can significantly impact capital and savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. The recent decisions by central banks and governments are expected to accelerate this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Understanding the Reverse Crisis and Inflation
A reverse financial crisis is deeply connected to inflation and the decisions made by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Since 2008, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have responded to financial crises by printing new money, flooding the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For example, 22% of all dollars currently in circulation were printed in 2020 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Governments increasingly spend more than they collect in taxes, leading to increased debt, which weakens currency and fuels inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. The United States deficit reached 8%, nearing levels seen during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This has contributed to one of the largest inflation crises in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

In a reverse crisis, like inflation, investments also see a rapid escalation in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. While this might seem positive, it's dangerous due to the impact on real returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This phenomenon has already been observed in stock markets in Germany, Argentina, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For instance, Argentina's Merval index multiplied 60 times in five years, and Turkey's rose 700% in the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.

### Real vs. Nominal Returns
Understanding a reverse financial crisis requires differentiating between nominal and real returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If an investment yields a 10% nominal return, but inflation is 15%, the real return is a negative 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:03:09]</a>. This means purchasing power is lost because prices for products and services increase faster than the value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:19]</a>. This silent problem often goes unnoticed until it's too late, especially for those with less financial literacy who bear the full cost of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:33]</a>.

Accumulated inflation since 2021 has reached 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:58]</a>. For the S&P 500 to have compensated for this inflation, it would need to reach 5,700 points, but it currently trades around 5,200 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:28]</a>. This represents a 10% loss in purchasing power for stock market investors, though it's still better than the 20% total loss experienced by those who did not invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:28">[00:04:42]</a>. This situation is driving stock market indices to historical highs due to the effect of reverse crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:05:00]</a>.

### Negative Real Interest Rates
These processes are closely tied to negative real interest rates, which occur when inflation outpaces the interest rate set by the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:19]</a>. Argentina, for example, has seen an average negative real interest rate of at least 6% over the last 12 years, leading to severe inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:36]</a>. Europe and the United States experienced negative real rates of 3-4% during 2021 and 2022, though for a shorter period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:51]</a>.

Many large investors, including [[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]], fear a second wave of inflation, potentially at a higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:06:02]</a>. Studies, like one by the Apollo Group, suggest inflation moves in waves, and when the Fed lowers rates, it tends to raise inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:14]</a>. The Apollo Group estimates a new increase in inflation and negative real interest rates within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:32]</a>.

Governments continue to face fiscal deficits and spend more than they earn, even as central banks plan to reduce interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:50]</a>.

## [[Warren Buffetts Investment Strategies During Inflation | Warren Buffett's Investment Advice]]

In his 2024 annual letter to investors, [[Warren Buffetts perspectives on inflation and economic crises | Warren Buffett]] warned about government fiscal deficits, stating that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:07:01]</a>. He also cautioned about inflation: "the effects of inflation can be enormous for the economy and extreme inflation is always a possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:09]</a>.

During inflationary periods, investing in stocks is generally more logical than bonds, as bonds tend to suffer from negative real rates, leading to reduced purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:45]</a>.

While some strategies suggest investing in sectors like gold miners or real estate (REITs), which can benefit from inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:08:01]</a>, these sectors often have lower quality businesses with higher volatility and historically poor performance outside of specific inflationary situations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:35]</a>.

[[Warren Buffetts investment advice | Warren Buffett]] proposes a different [[Investment strategies during inflation | investment strategy]] for inflationary environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:39]</a>. When asked how he would invest in future inflation, he responded:
> "The best businesses are those that require little investment and that their strength is based on a brand. It is wonderful to own a business with a brand during an inflation crisis." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:53]</a>

### Key Characteristics of Preferred Investments:
*   **Strong Brand or Competitive Advantage:** [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] values businesses with competitive advantages or strong brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Pricing Power:** This competitive advantage allows companies to possess "pricing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:02]</a>. This is a crucial characteristic to demand from investments in inflationary environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:06]</a>.
*   **Ability to Raise Prices:** Companies with pricing power can increase their prices at a rate equal to or greater than inflation's rise, even as their costs increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Profit Growth:** This enables profits to rise faster than inflation, reflecting value creation and protecting investors from inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:23]</a>.

These types of businesses also tend to perform well consistently in non-crisis periods, providing predictable returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:35]</a>. This approach allows investors to build a portfolio resilient to various economic environments, without needing to predict future economic or central bank decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:47]</a>.

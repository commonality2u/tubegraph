BlackRock is commonly described as the owner of the world due to its tremendous power and control over global assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. This company manages over $10 trillion, making it the largest shareholder in the main listed companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. The assets under its control account for more than 10% of the world economy, a figure larger than any country except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

## Accusations and Concerns
Many sources accuse BlackRock of allowing or contributing to environmental damage, social inequality, and financial fraud due to its immense power and control over companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. It is highly probable that a portion of personal savings are directly or indirectly involved with BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Leadership and Business Model
BlackRock is led by Larry Fink, its enigmatic CEO, who is considered one of the most economically powerful individuals globally, yet remains largely unknown to the general public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Like any private company, BlackRock's primary objective is to generate profits for its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Client Base
The majority of BlackRock's clients are banks, insurers, pension plans, and sovereign funds from some of the wealthiest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. However, a significant portion of its client base also consists of small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>.

### Influence in the Financial Sector
BlackRock controls the financial sector, often regarded as the economy's "lung" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>. It holds majority positions in leading global banks, including Wells Fargo, Banco Am√©rica, Citigroup, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This creates a paradoxical situation where many of these banks are also BlackRock's main clients, providing it with more money to further increase its controlling stake in global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. Investment plans commonly offered by banks often channel client money into BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:12">[00:02:12]</a>. Even uninvested deposits in banks may end up in BlackRock products as banks invest for their own benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

BlackRock utilizes the commercial name "iShares" to channel investments and own companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. Its iShares ETFs, such as the iShares Core S&P 500 (ticker: IVV), are among the most traded stocks on the New York Stock Exchange, with a daily volume exceeding $2 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>.

### Potential Conflicts of Interest
BlackRock has a controversial division called BlackRock Solutions, which audits and controls risks for major global banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This division gains access to the intimate internal accounts and data of these banks, creating a [[potential_conflicts_of_interest_in_industries_controlled_by_blackrock | potential conflict of interest]] as BlackRock is also a main investor in these very banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. BlackRock claims the divisions are separate with "Chinese walls" for information control <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Global Reach and Historical Significance
BlackRock's influence extends beyond the richest economies like the United States and Europe; it is also a primary lender to emerging countries, further solidifying its [[influence_and_control_of_blackrock_in_the_global_economy | influence and control]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. During the 2008 financial crisis, the Federal Reserve commissioned BlackRock to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>.

### Passive Investment and Power Concentration
BlackRock generates 80% of its income from advising on financial products like iShares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. These ETFs made it easier for the general public to invest in the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. It is estimated that 60% of invested money in the United States is now passive, often in products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:59">[00:05:59]</a>.

A significant concern arising from this investment style is the true control of companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Investors who buy BlackRock products delegate voting rights to BlackRock, concentrating power in a few entities that control major global companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This creates "circular structures" where client funds grant BlackRock more power over key financial and economic entities, which then provide more funds, further increasing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>.

This [[influence_and_control_of_blackrock_in_the_global_economy | accumulation of power]] also raises [[potential_conflicts_of_interest_in_industries_controlled_by_blackrock | potential conflicts of interest]] and concerns about competition between companies controlled by a single entity like BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, while BlackRock may not appear as a main shareholder of McDonald's, it is a main shareholder of its competitor, Wendy's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. This pattern of a single company controlling major players within a sector is observed in the automotive, airline, and financial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

According to a CNN report, BlackRock and Vanguard collectively control over $15 trillion in assets, rivaling the American economy ($23 trillion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:57">[00:07:57]</a>. These two companies are the main shareholders of 85% of the world's major listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>.

### Control Over Media
BlackRock also exerts power in the media sector, which is crucial for influencing public opinion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. It is estimated that they control 95% of traditional and new-generation media, such as Facebook, where they are among the largest shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:25">[00:08:25]</a>.

### [[blackrocks_role_in_environmental_and_social_issues | Environmental and Social Influence]]
In 2021, BlackRock leveraged its power to pressure companies like ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, to reduce its CO2 emissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. ExxonMobil subsequently committed to achieving net-zero emissions by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.

## Investing in BlackRock
BlackRock itself is a publicly traded company (NYSE: BLK), trading at approximately $700 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Since its listing in 2000, BlackRock shares have multiplied by over 50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The company projects continued annual growth of 15% through 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>. BlackRock treats its shareholders well, returning over 75% of its earnings through dividends and share buybacks, with dividends increasing at an average rate of 18% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

### Inflation's Impact
Inflation could have a neutral or even positive effect on BlackRock's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. As BlackRock charges a percentage on the value of its listed ETFs, an increase in ETF value due to inflation would lead to higher commissions without a proportional increase in costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. In environments with high inflation, the nominal value of financial assets tends to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

## Risks of Passive Investment and ETFs
[[analysis_of_prominent_stock_market_investors | Large investors]] like Michael Burry, known for predicting the 2008 financial crisis (as depicted in "The Big Short"), have warned that passive investing and ETFs represent a "huge bubble" due to the high valuations many companies are reaching, regardless of their quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:07">[00:12:07]</a>.

These ETFs operate by forcing automated buying of shares when a stock's market value and relative weight within an index increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>, further inflating valuations and attracting more passive capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:35">[00:12:35]</a>. Burry cautions that "the music will stop playing" for this investment style when capital outflows exceed inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. He compares it to playing musical chairs: the longer the game continues, the higher the likelihood of being left without a chair and losing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

## Personal Investment Advice
It is crucial for investors to take full responsibility for their investments, understanding where their money is invested, the commissions paid, and the expected risks and returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. Given the complexity of the financial system, continuous education and learning are key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. While simplifying investments through ETFs or passive funds may seem appealing, it could be "potentially creating financial non-bu" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. The speaker believes that individual stock selection will gain more weight in the future, as it will reveal discrepancies between undervalued companies not part of major indices and overvalued companies benefiting from passive inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

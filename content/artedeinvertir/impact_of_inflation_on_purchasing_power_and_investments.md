A significant risk to the stock market, termed the "reverse crisis," is increasingly possible and could silently diminish capital and savings if not understood <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Central bank and government decisions are accelerating this process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Noted investors like Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, and Stanley Druckenmiller have issued warnings about this new market situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. Understanding this phenomenon is crucial for anyone with savings or investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Understanding the Reverse Financial Crisis

A reverse financial crisis is intrinsically linked to [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] and the actions of central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Causes of Inflation

Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, have been injecting new currency into the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Since 2008, printing new money has been a recurrent solution to financial crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For instance, in 2020, 22% of the total dollars currently in circulation were printed within a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>, a remarkable figure given the currency's 200-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

Governments increasingly spend more than they collect in taxes, necessitating increased borrowing and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This practice weakens a currency and fuels [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>. The United States deficit reached an 8% level, comparable to the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. These factors have contributed to one of the largest [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_markets | inflation crises]] in the last 40 years, profoundly altering the economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

### Inflation's Impact on Investments and Purchasing Power

In a reverse crisis, similar to the rising prices of products and services during non-stop [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]], [[inflation_and_its_impact_on_investment_assets | investments]] also experience a rapid escalation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. While seemingly positive, this trend is dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:16">[00:02:16]</a>. This type of reverse crisis has already occurred in major stock markets in countries like Germany, Argentina, and Turkey <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>. For example:
*   The Merval index in Argentina multiplied by 60 times in 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>.
*   Turkey's market saw a 700% rise in just 5 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   Germany experienced an 800% rise in less than 2 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:39">[00:02:39]</a>.

To grasp the concept, it's essential to differentiate between nominal and real return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If an investment of $10,000 rises to $11,000, it represents a 10% nominal return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. However, if [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] during the same period was 15%, the real return would be a negative 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>. This happens because the price of services and products increases faster than the value of money, leading to a loss of purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This loss of purchasing power is a "silent problem" that many overlook until it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Those with less financial literacy often bear the full cost of [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] without the benefit of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.

Since 2021, accumulated [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] has reached 20% due to government and central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. For the S&P 500 index, which was around 4800 points in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>, it would have needed to reach 5700 points to compensate for this 20% [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. However, trading at 5200 points, it represents a 10% loss in purchasing power for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. While better than not investing (which resulted in a 20% loss), the ongoing [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] means purchasing power continues to erode <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. This environment is causing major stock market indices to rise sharply, often reaching historical highs due to this reverse crisis effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

### The Role of Real Interest Rates

These inflationary processes are closely tied to negative real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This occurs when the [[influence_of_inflation_and_interest_rates_on_markets | inflation]] level surpasses the interest rate set by the Central Bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>.
*   In Argentina, the average real interest rate has been negative by at least 6% over the last 12 years, leading to severe [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.
*   Europe and the United States experienced negative real rates of 3-4% during 2021-2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>. Although shorter in duration (12-24 months), the consequences have been significant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>.

A major concern among investors is a potential second wave of [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] at an even higher level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. Studies, like one by Apollo Group, indicate that [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] tends to move in waves, and lowering rates often raises [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]], similar to the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This study suggests a new increase in [[inflation_expectations_and_their_impact_on_investments | inflation]] and negative real interest rates could occur within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

Despite central banks' plans to reduce interest rates, governments continue to grapple with fiscal deficits, spending more than they earn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Warren Buffett has warned that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a> and that "extreme [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] is always a possibility" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

## Protecting Capital and Investments in an Inflationary Environment

During periods of [[the_influence_of_inflation_on_investment_portfolios | inflation]], investing in stocks has typically been more logical than bonds, as bonds tend to suffer in negative real rate environments due to a certain reduction in purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:35">[00:07:35]</a>. However, not all stocks are suitable.

### Investment Strategies

There are two main approaches to address the problem of [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]]:

1.  **Investing in Inflation-Benefiting Sectors:** If high [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] is expected, sectors like gold miners or [[the_impact_of_inflation_on_real_estate_and_investment_sectors | real estate (REITs)]] tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>. These sectors generally protect against [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a>. However, outside of specific inflationary scenarios, these sectors may underperform the broader market as they can be lower quality businesses with higher volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

2.  **Warren Buffett's Approach: Businesses with Pricing Power:** Warren Buffett advocates for investing in businesses that require little investment and possess strong brands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:35">[00:08:35]</a>. Owning a business with a powerful brand is particularly beneficial during an [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:51">[00:08:51]</a>.
    *   **Competitive Advantage and Pricing Power:** A strong brand or competitive advantage grants a business "pricing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>. This crucial characteristic allows companies to raise prices at a rate equal to or exceeding [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]], thereby managing increased costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. Consequently, their profits can outpace [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]], and their stock market value tends to reflect this value creation, protecting investors from [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
    *   **Consistent Performance:** Such businesses have also demonstrated consistent and predictable returns even when a reverse crisis is not occurring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. This strategy allows investors to maintain a portfolio resilient across various economic environments without needing to predict future economic conditions or central bank decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Examples of large-cap stocks with significant pricing power include Walmart, Microsoft, Campbell, Philip Morris, Dollar General, and Lockheed Martin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:03">[00:10:03]</a>. Many of these companies have been successful investments for Warren Buffett and have performed well over recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>.

This article discusses the [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market|biggest risk]] currently facing both the economy and the stock market, exploring different scenarios and investment strategies to adapt to potential market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. Preparing for [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis|market crashes]] beforehand is crucial, as most people only react after they happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:34">[00:00:34]</a>.

## Key Risks and Indicators

The market is at a critical juncture, and certain unpleasant situations may arise depending on how the current environment evolves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

### Inflation
Inflation has significantly impacted the market, causing high-growth speculative stocks to drop while cyclical stocks and raw materials have performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. The Federal Reserve (Fed) meeting on a recent Wednesday drastically changed the market structure, which will likely weigh heavily in the short and medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Rising Interest Rates
Starting in 2023, an increase in interest rates is anticipated, which will have a very significant [[economic_indicators_and_their_impact_on_stock_markets|impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. After years of zero or negative rates and money printing, the market is highly sensitive due to high valuations and record debt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. If interest rates rise, a portion of company and state income will go towards debt repayment instead of investment, hindering GDP growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>.

James Bullard, a Fed committee member, suggested that interest rates could start rising as early as 2022, much sooner than the market's expectation of 2024 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:15">[00:05:15]</a>. This announcement caused a significant market drop, particularly affecting stocks that had risen the most <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>. While traditionally, rising interest rates benefit raw materials and cyclical stocks, these were the ones that fell the most in the short term due to the unexpected news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

Many believe inflation is transitory, but some, like Bullard, view it as more structural, necessitating aggressive Fed action and rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>. This could lead to a collapse, especially for overvalued stocks where euphoria is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### High Debt Levels and Market Euphoria
Total debt in the system has multiplied threefold since the 2008 crisis, reaching 35 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. If interest rates on this debt rise, it could trigger a new crisis or market stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. An early warning occurred in 2008 when rates near 3% caused significant falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

The market is also experiencing record euphoria with investments in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and other assets, posing an [[stock_market_risks_and_strategies|additional risk]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. Massive capital inflows, especially into technology stocks, have been observed in 2021, totaling 1.2 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:59">[01:00:59]</a>. This capital, often from "weak hands," tends to exit quickly if fear arises, leading to significant sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:02">[01:00:02]</a>.

### Ray Dalio's Bubble Warning
[[key_economic_risks_identified_by_ray_dalio|Ray Dalio]] warns that we are in one of the biggest speculative bubbles of all time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>. While sometimes exaggerated, his observations highlight the current speculative environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Possible Economic Scenarios and Market Performance

Three possible scenarios are outlined to understand how to face potential market developments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Scenario 1: Aggressive Rate Hike
This scenario, though less likely, involves the Fed making a very aggressive increase in rates, potentially above 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>. This would cause many companies with high debt, and several countries, to experience severe economic contractions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:45">[00:08:45]</a>.

In this scenario:
*   **Problem:** High valuation risk, especially for technology stocks using very high multiples due to previously low interest rates, and fixed-income bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>.
*   **Perform well:** Raw materials, gold, cyclical automobile companies, and "value" stocks (those not trading at very high multiples or producing sufficient current profits) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:14">[00:09:14]</a>.
*   **Caution:** Overvalued technology stocks, some of which could fall by 99% and go bankrupt, as they cannot finance themselves cheaply without profits when interest rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### Scenario 2: Slight Rate Increase (Most Likely)
This is considered the most likely scenario, involving a slight increase in rates closer to 2024, as initially anticipated by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>. The market perceives inflation as temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

In this scenario:
*   **Perform well:** Technology stocks, bonds, and growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:37">[00:10:37]</a>.
*   **Perform poorly:** Gold companies and raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>.
*   **Risk:** Uncertainty if inflation proves to be structural rather than temporary, potentially pushing the market back to Scenario 1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:02">[00:11:02]</a>.

### Scenario 3: Delayed Rate Hike (Unlikely)
This unlikely scenario involves the Fed delaying rate hikes due to ongoing risks like confinement, fearing economic derailment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:40">[01:34:40]</a>. This could unleash significant inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:56">[01:34:56]</a>.

In this scenario:
*   **Perform well:** Technology stocks, while cyclicals and raw materials continue to perform poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:00">[01:36:00]</a>.

## Investment Strategies and Opportunities

The best approach is to prepare for crises before they happen, recognizing that the future is uncertain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:58">[01:05:58]</a>.

### Core Investment Philosophy
The best recipe is to hold solid companies with good profits that can perform well in various economic environments and do not carry too much debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>.

Key characteristics of desirable stocks:
1.  **Certain Growth:** Will do well if rates don't rise significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:09">[02:12:09]</a>.
2.  **Profitability:** Even if rates rise, these companies can finance themselves without relying on cheap debt or issuing new shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>.
3.  **Affordable Valuation:** Reasonable valuation levels that produce current benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:34">[02:22:34]</a>.

### Expert Opinions on Strategy
*   **Jamie Dimon (JP Morgan CEO):** Believes inflation may be more than transitory and advocates for patience and accumulating liquidity, citing high market valuations and "weak hands" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:57">[01:16:57]</a>.
*   **Warren Buffett:** Has been accumulating liquidity and not investing much in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:26">[01:19:26]</a>. His success in the 1980s, a period of high interest rates and inflation, came from investing in quality stocks at reasonable prices, like Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:17:16">[02:17:16]</a>. These companies didn't need to reinvest heavily in fixed assets or expensive machinery, and their costs (like labor) weren't as affected by inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:19:07">[02:19:07]</a>.

### Examples of Investment Opportunities

The following companies are highlighted as examples of stocks that can perform well across different scenarios or offer specific advantages:

*   **Adobe:**
    *   **Profile:** Grows, generates profits (unlike many current growth stocks), and is reasonably priced considering future prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:04">[02:10:04]</a>.
    *   **Competitive Advantage:** Irreplaceable software (Photoshop, Premiere, PDFs) with high switching costs and a dominant market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:40">[02:23:40]</a>.
    *   **Inflation Protection:** Software companies don't need to reinvest heavily in fixed assets; if inflation raises prices, their costs rise more slowly, boosting profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:05">[02:27:05]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Annual revenue growth rate of 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:05">[02:24:05]</a>.
    *   **Share Buybacks:** Company buys back a significant portion of its generated benefits, indicating management believes shares are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:07">[02:29:07]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Target price of $900-$1000, almost double its current price, relatively independent of the [[economic_risks_and_investment_strategies|economic scenario]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:12">[02:30:12]</a>.

*   **Equinix:**
    *   **Profile:** Technological but also a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT) focused on data centers (e.g., for Amazon Web Services, Google Cloud) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:57">[02:30:57]</a>.
    *   **Inflation Protection:** Real estate investments perform well during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:47">[02:31:47]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Resistance:** Data centers are an inelastic expense for companies, making the business resilient to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:27">[02:34:27]</a>.

    *   **Valuation:** Reasonable valuation, currently trading at 30 times FFO, with a target valuation between $1200-$1700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:57">[02:34:57]</a>.

*   **MTY Food Group (MTY):**
    *   **Profile:** Fast-food franchises that collect royalties instead of operating restaurants, minimizing reinvestment needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:31">[02:36:31]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Resistance:** Fast food has historically performed well in crises, even increasing sales (e.g., McDonald's in 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:14">[02:36:14]</a>. MTY never lost money during the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:46">[02:37:46]</a>.
    *   **Inflation Protection:** As restaurants raise prices due to inflation, MTY's royalty income increases without higher costs, boosting profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Typically grows 15% by acquiring franchises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:21">[02:37:21]</a>. Operating EBITDA grew 27% annually between 2013-2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:00">[02:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Low valuation, at 11 times earnings, unlike other growth stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:12">[02:38:12]</a>. Target valuation of $160, triple its current price, in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:30">[02:42:30]</a>.

*   **GoEasy (GSY):**
    *   **Profile:** Financial company offering personal loans and credit cards with high interest rates (around 30%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:57">[02:45:57]</a>.
    *   **Inflation Protection:** Can absorb financing rate increases without significantly affecting income due to high margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:08">[02:46:08]</a>. No need to reinvest in expensive fixed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:50">[02:46:50]</a>. Borrowers' ability to repay debt improves with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:42">[02:46:42]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Resistance:** Increased profits even in 2020; in 2008-2009, profits slightly fell but maintained well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:08">[02:47:08]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Grows around 30% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:30">[02:47:30]</a>. Market share of 3% in Canada's prime loan market indicates high growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:02">[02:48:02]</a>. Launching new products like auto financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:08">[02:48:08]</a>.

*   **Enbridge (ENB):**
    *   **Profile:** Oil and gas pipeline company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:43">[02:53:43]</a>.
    *   **Inflation Protection:** Rising oil prices indirectly benefit Enbridge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:36">[02:55:36]</a>.
    *   **Crisis Resistance:** Pipelines are very stable, unlike oil companies, which are cyclical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:17">[02:57:17]</a>. In 2008-2009, while oil fell 50-60%, Enbridge only dropped 20-25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>.
    *   **Growth & Dividend:** Expected to grow benefits by 5-7% annually until 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:02">[02:55:02]</a>. Offers a current dividend yield of 7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:45">[02:56:45]</a>.

    *   **Growth:** Expected to grow 94% this year due to acquisition of its main rival, which also eliminated price wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:04:55">[04:04:55]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Cheap at 10-11 times free cash flow, with potential to double <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:09">[04:05:09]</a>.

*   **Texas Pacific Land Trust (TPL):**
    *   **Profile:** Owns oil and water royalties, meaning it doesn't need to invest in fixed assets or oil wells but receives income from extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:38">[04:57:38]</a>.
    *   **Inflation Protection:** Protected from inflation; if oil prices rise, it receives more royalties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:48">[04:57:48]</a>.
    *   **Valuation:** Good business with growth, but quite expensive at over 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:58:01">[04:58:01]</a>.

### Examples of Risky Stocks (due to Valuation/Speculation)

*   **Snowflake:**
    *   **Problem:** High valuation. While projected to grow revenue significantly by 2029, its current market capitalization is already higher than its projected intrinsic valuation even with generous future growth estimates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:43:32">[03:43:32]</a>.
    *   **Risk:** Highly sensitive to interest rate increases. Even a significant price drop (e.g., 80%) would only make it a reasonable long-term investment, not a bargain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>.

*   **Nikola (NKLA):**
    *   **Problem:** Considered "smoke" and a "lottery ticket" stock, with a CEO who admitted to fraud <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:25">[03:59:25]</a>.
    *   **Risk:** Lacks a solid business model or controlled risk, making it highly speculative and prone to collapse in a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:40">[03:59:40]</a>.

*   **Shake Shack (SHAK):**
    *   **Problem:** Very high multiples due to perceived growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:43">[04:08:43]</a>.
    *   **Risk:** While it has potential to grow significantly, its current valuation makes it vulnerable to corrections if growth slows or market sentiment shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:49">[04:09:49]</a>.

### General Advice for Investors
*   **Avoid "Lottery Tickets":** Do not treat the stock market as a lottery; invest in well-researched businesses with controlled risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:42">[03:59:42]</a>.
*   **Understand Valuation:** A good project at a high valuation can still be risky. The project must be good, and the valuation reasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:45:16">[04:45:16]</a>.
*   **Go Against the Current:** When the market is euphoric and people are overweighted in stocks, it often leads to falls. Conversely, times of panic can be good [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty|investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:48">[01:18:48]</a>.
*   **Long-Term View:** Focus on long-term value generation rather than short-term fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:46">[02:57:46]</a>.
*   **Manage Expectations:** Expect surprises and occasional underperformance in a portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:24">[03:22:24]</a>. The goal is not to lose money (Rule #1) and not to forget Rule #1 (Rule #2) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:42">[03:22:42]</a>.

Investing successfully requires understanding both the company's value creation, reasonable valuation, and effective management that returns value to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:50">[03:22:50]</a>.

Kathy Wood has emerged as a prominent figure on Wall Street, known for her revolutionary approach to stock investment, particularly focusing on innovation and disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Her success has garnered significant attention, making her a "guru" in the financial world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>.

## Kathy Wood: A New Wall Street Star

Kathy Wood, previously unknown in investment banking, founded her investment company, Ark Invest, in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. Since then, her rise has been "meteoric" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. Ark Invest has grown from managing a small sum to overseeing more than $30 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. Forbes magazine estimates her personal wealth exceeds $500 million, accumulated in a few years through this investment success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

Her flagship fund, Ark Innovation, delivered a 170% return in 2020 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, and over the last five years, it has achieved a return of over 700% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy: Beyond Traditional Metrics

Kathy Wood defines herself as an investor in innovation and disruptive technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Her approach significantly diverges from traditional Wall Street investment strategies, which typically emphasize numerical financial and accounting aspects of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:11">[00:02:11]</a>. She advocates for setting aside traditional financial restrictions and focusing on companies that are revolutionizing the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:30">[00:02:30]</a>.

For Kathy Wood, financial metrics take a backseat <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Her investment decisions are based on two core premises:
1.  **Revolutionary Company:** The company must be revolutionary and transforming a mature sector (e.g., Spotify in music) or directly creating new sectors (e.g., Teladoc in telemedicine) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.
2.  **High Sales Growth:** The company must demonstrate high sales growth, even if it is not currently profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. She theorizes that many of these companies will dominate their respective markets, reinvesting earnings to grow and gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>.

This philosophy is exemplified by Amazon, which for decades reinvested heavily, leading to losses, but eventually became highly profitable, enriching shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:34">[00:03:34]</a>. Conversely, she would not invest in traditional, high-quality companies like Nestl√©, as they operate in mature sectors with limited growth capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### Kathy Wood's Core Investment Themes

Ark Invest focuses on six main [[investment opportunities in electric vehicle and tech stocks | investment themes]] that represent disruptive innovation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>:
*   Artificial Intelligence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>
*   Autonomous Cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   Robotics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:39">[00:04:39]</a>
*   3D Printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>
*   Genetics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:42">[00:04:42]</a>
*   Financial Technology (Fintech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:43">[00:04:43]</a>

## Market Warnings and Future Outlook

Kathy Wood has issued warnings about a "major bubble" and "enormous risk" in passive or indexed management, specifically mentioning major indices like the S&P 500, Dow Jones, and MSCI World <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>. This aligns with warnings from other investors like Michael Burry, who also cautioned about a bubble forming in these financial products that could rival the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

Wood argues that indices like the S&P 500 are "full of average companies" and designed for an inflationary world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. However, she believes the world is heading towards a deflationary scenario due to high technological innovation and significant cost reduction across the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:34">[00:05:34]</a>.

Her [[current_trends_and_future_predictions_in_stock_market_and_investments | future scenario]] predicts that when these indices perform poorly and the bubble bursts, the market will favor companies with a high innovative component and technological disruption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>. These companies, often not included in major indices, would theoretically thrive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

She doesn't believe we are currently in an equity bubble, stating that a rotation from bonds to equities is needed to signal one <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>. Younger investors, or millennials, prefer to invest in stocks, cryptocurrencies, and housing, which are also the sectors Ark Invest favors for the coming year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. In contrast, fixed income and bonds have seen the most capital flow in recent years and are widely considered to be in a "tremendous bubble" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

    *   **Market Position:** Holds the largest market share in smart TV systems and services, ahead of Microsoft and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>.
    *   **Outlook:** Expected to grow more than 40% annually over the next few years, despite not currently producing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

*   **Crispr Therapeutics (CRSP)**
    *   **Weighting:** 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:06">[00:09:06]</a>
    *   **Sector:** Genetics and DNA modification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:15">[00:09:15]</a>, one of Kathy Wood's favorite sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.
    *   **Development:** Still in the development phase; its gene therapies could potentially cure hereditary diseases like cancer, heart, respiratory, or neurological problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:22">[00:09:22]</a>.
    *   **Risk:** Considered a "very speculative stock" due to not yet generating income and having multiplied over ten times in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

*   **Square (SQ)**
    *   **Weighting:** 4.7% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>
    *   **Sector:** Financial technology (Fintech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>, another favored sector by Wood due to the financial sector's limited innovation in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.
    *   **Services:** Offers online and physical payment systems for merchants in a simple, efficient, and cost-effective way compared to traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>.
    *   **Performance:** Multiplied by more than 20 times on the stock market in under 5 years since its IPO <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>.

    *   **Weighting:** 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>
    *   **Sector:** Revolutionized the telemedicine segment with mobile applications and videoconferencing systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Grew from $120 million to over $1 billion in billing in less than four years, equivalent to more than 80% annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>.
    *   **Market Potential:** The telemedicine segment in the US alone could be worth $250 billion in a few years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:37">[00:11:37]</a>. Teladoc currently represents only 0.4% of this potential market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>.
    *   **Profitability/Risk:** Has positive earnings and cash flow, but its valuation is demanding, trading at over 100 times earnings, compared to the market average of 20 times earnings, which increases future risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>.

*   **Invitae Holdings (NVTA)**
    *   **Weighting:** 4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
    *   **Sector:** Genetics and DNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, similar to Crispr Therapeutics.

    *   **Weighting:** 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>
    *   **Sector:** A fully digital real estate agency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>, enabling buying, selling, renting, or financing housing through its platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:24">[00:13:24]</a>.
    *   **Growth:** Drastically reduces costs, allowing the company to grow over 30% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
    *   **Profitability/Risk:** While it produces positive sales and profits, its valuation is very demanding, reaching 100 times EBITDA, whereas the market average for this ratio is 12 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>.

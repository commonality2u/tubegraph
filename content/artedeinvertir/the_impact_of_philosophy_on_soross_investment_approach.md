George Soros, a renowned figure in finance, attributes a significant portion of his wealth to his unique theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. While many [[famous_investors_and_their_principles | investors]], including the speaker, draw concepts from figures like [[investment_strategies_inspired_by_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]], Soros's work, particularly his writings, offers a distinct and highly successful [[soross_investment_strategies_and_success | investment approach]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Soros's Early Life and Philosophical Roots

Soros's early life as a Hungarian refugee during World War II deeply influenced his perspective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His middle-class parents falsified papers to allow him to reach the United Kingdom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. With some financial means, he gained admission to the prestigious London Business School, an institution that remains highly respected today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>.

Soros himself states that his true passion lies in philosophy, not investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. A key mentor during his studies was Karl Popper, a philosopher who greatly influenced Soros's thinking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. It was this desire to merge philosophy with [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investment]] that led to the development of his theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:54">[00:01:54]</a>.

After graduating, Soros faced difficulties finding employment in a xenophobic society, taking unbefitting jobs like door-to-door sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>. His entry into the financial world came through a fortuitous meeting with another Hungarian manager at a financial institution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:26">[00:02:26]</a>.

Initially, Soros began as a value investor, focusing on cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. However, his [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | philosophy]] evolved over the years, adapting his style to maximize profit potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>. He gained a reputation for identifying undervalued German stocks in the 1950s and 60s, particularly those with dual stock structures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:58">[00:02:58]</a>. His successful reports for clients eventually led to the founding of his own fund, the Quantum Fund (now Soros Fund Management), starting with just $23 million in 1970 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. The fund achieved average annual returns of 25% over 45 years, primarily through organic growth fueled by compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Importantly, Soros's fund navigated major market crises (e.g., 1987, 1990, dot-com bubble, 2008, 2011) without significant losses, often emerging strengthened <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:39">[00:00:39]</a>.

## The Theory of Reflexivity

Soros elaborates on his theory in his book, "The Alchemy of Finance," published in 1988-1989 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. This complex book requires deep financial knowledge and investment experience to fully grasp <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>.

The core of reflexivity asserts that the financial system, being a human creation, cannot have its crises predicted in the same way as natural phenomena like weather <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>. If they could be predicted, they wouldn't happen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Instead, Soros posits that it is exceedingly difficult to predict the economy itself due to a multitude of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>.

### Perception Over Prediction

Soros argues that successful investing isn't about guessing what the economy will do, but rather about understanding the *perception* investors will have of what the economy will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. He emphasizes focusing on investors, as financial markets are a collective mentality created by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>.

He draws a parallel with **quantum theory**: the observer influences the observed element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:14">[00:07:14]</a>. In financial markets, participants (investors, large or small) formulating a vision about the market actually *influence* the market itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. Unlike predicting rain, where one's vision doesn't affect the weather, an investor's belief that markets will fall, combined with their participation, can contribute to that fall â€” a "self-fulfilling prophecy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

### Boom and Bust Patterns

Reflexivity seeks to identify "boom" (large rises) and "bust" (large falls) patterns, often referred to as bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>. Soros asserts that markets are inherently unstable and biased, not stable, directly contradicting the theory of efficient markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:22">[00:08:22]</a>. Participants act based on emotions, feelings, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

Central to his explanation is a graph showing:
*   **Red Line**: Perception of reality (e.g., a sector, currency) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.
*   **Blue Line**: Price of assets/quotation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

When a reflective process occurs, perception can modify price, and sometimes, price modifies reality. The key phases of a reflective process, particularly a bubble, are:
1.  **Initial Perception Shift (A-B)**: People begin to perceive something as a good investment (e.g., housing in Spain in the late 90s/early 2000s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>. The market price (blue line) lags but then rises much faster than fundamentals suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.
2.  **Test Period (B-C)**: A temporary stabilization or slight fall in prices (e.g., Spanish real estate in 2001-2002 after the S&P 500 fall) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>.
3.  **Reinforcing Rally (C-D)**: If this fall isn't too abrupt and people regain confidence (seeing it as a buying opportunity), the price can have another super rally, often higher than the initial peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:40">[00:11:40]</a>. This is where market participants *produce* changes in reality. For example, rising oil prices lead to increased orders and profits for oil service companies, reinforcing the positive perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
4.  **New Paradigm/Disconnection (D-E)**: The bubble reaches a point where prices become completely disconnected from reality, as seen in the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>. Small events or news can then trigger enormous falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:42">[00:13:42]</a>. For example, Bill Gates stating Microsoft shares were overvalued contributed to the dot-com crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:54">[00:13:54]</a>. At this stage, the fall becomes irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.
5.  **Danger Zone (E-F)**: Even as prices fall, fundamentals initially maintain inertia due to previous capital flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. This is the most dangerous moment, as "bargain hunters" may appear, believing fundamentals are still strong and expecting a repeat of the test period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:42">[00:14:42]</a>. However, reflexivity in a downtrend means the fall produces changes in reality, and the reflective period has ended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:06">[00:15:06]</a>.

### Assets Soros Operates In
Soros typically operates across four or five asset classes:
*   Currencies of liquid countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>
*   Indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>
*   Raw materials (e.g., gold, oil) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>
*   Common stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>
*   Index futures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:46">[00:05:46]</a>

## Reflexivity in Practice: Case Studies

### The 2008 Financial Crisis
The 2008 crisis provides a clear example of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>. After Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and the S&P 500 plummeting 58% by March 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:26">[00:15:26]</a>, the market began to rise based on small news items and capital injections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Traditionally, the stock market is seen as anticipating events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>. However, Soros argues the opposite: market participants *produce* changes in reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>. In 2009, companies continued to report weak results for three to four quarters, yet the market had an "incredible rally" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>. This disconnect shows the traditional theory lacking <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:22">[00:16:22]</a>.

Instead of looking at GDP data, investors, central bankers, and corporations monitor the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>. When the S&P hit its lowest point, people were reluctant to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:54">[00:16:54]</a>. But as the S&P began to rise, people's confidence returned. Corporations started investing in capital expenditures or buying back shares, and central bankers injected liquidity, stimulating the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:10">[00:17:10]</a>. The economy's actual contraction (GDP fell by 2.3% in the US) wasn't disastrous, but general fear and a lack of lending created paralysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:40">[00:17:40]</a>. The rising S&P restored confidence, credit flowed, and the economy recovered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:54">[00:17:54]</a>. This is a classic "reflective process" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

### Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs)
A more recent example of reflexivity is seen in Spanish REITs (SOCIMIs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:09">[00:18:09]</a>. Around two years ago, housing prices in Spain began recovering, but the market was initially skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:28">[00:18:28]</a>. The emergence of SOCIMIs, which started trading at a premium to their book value (e.g., 1.2x book value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:06">[00:19:06]</a>, allowed them to issue new shares at this inflated price and acquire assets in the private market at book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:15">[00:19:15]</a>. This process increased earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:51">[00:19:51]</a>.

Investors then perceived SOCIMIs as "growth companies," establishing a "new paradigm" and driving their prices even higher (e.g., 1.3 or 1.4x book value) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:20">[00:20:20]</a>. Each announcement of a capital increase further boosted share prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:53">[00:20:53]</a>. However, when a downturn occurred (e.g., Ibex fall), and these companies started trading below book value (e.g., 0.8x) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:37">[00:21:37]</a>, new capital increases at these lower prices *decreased* earnings per share, reversing the positive reflexive loop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:46">[00:21:46]</a>.

Soros's theory helps in both speculating and protecting investments by understanding these self-reinforcing (or self-defeating) cycles where market perception influences fundamental reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:14">[00:22:14]</a>. His approach stresses the importance of analyzing how new growth is financed, preferring cash flow generation over capital increases that can create vicious circles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:38">[00:22:38]</a>.

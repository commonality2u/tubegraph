The rise in popularity of the stock market and investments over the last two years has attracted unscrupulous individuals seeking to defraud others using complex deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Among the various [[stock_market_scams_and_how_to_detect_them | dangerous scams]], [[Pyramid schemes in stock market investments | pyramid schemes]] and multilevel systems are particularly prevalent in the investment world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## How Pyramid Schemes Work in Investments
This scam type is considered one of the most dangerous because victims not only lose their money but can also negatively impact their family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

### The Deceptive Pitch
The product or service offered in a pyramid scheme is merely an excuse to comply with the law and avoid suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>. The scammer initiates the pyramid by promising future investors two main things:
1.  **Capital Safety**: Their invested capital will be totally safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  **High Returns**: They will receive exceptionally high returns, often quoted as 1% daily or 15% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

These seemingly favorable conditions make it easy to attract people to deposit money into the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Conditions and Recruitment
Two additional conditions are usually established:
1.  **Blocked Funds**: Money must be invested in the network for a minimum period, such as 3, 6, or 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>.
2.  **Recruitment Incentives**: Investors are promised exponentially higher benefits if they bring new people into the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This is because the system relies on new capital constantly entering to sustain itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

### The Illusion of Profit
The core secret of this system is that by blocking the money of new participants, older participants who wish to withdraw can be paid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This creates credibility, as initial investors can indeed withdraw their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:17">[00:04:17]</a>. However, since everyone appears to be "earning" fictitious money that seems to be growing, most people do not actually withdraw their funds, allowing the pyramid to grow and affect thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

The actual investments made by these schemes are irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Scammers often use trendy assets like cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>, or traditional ones like gold or specific stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>. The money is not genuinely invested in these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Instead, victims are given keys and access to online platforms where their invested money appears to be growing non-stop, but this data is completely manipulated and not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### The Inevitable Collapse
These networks or pyramids always end the same way: when more capital leaves the network than enters <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. This triggers panic as old investors cannot be paid the promised benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Everyone rushes to withdraw their money, only to realize the scam and that the money is not there <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Historical Examples
These scams can reach gigantic proportions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. In Spain, some years ago, pyramids were created under the guise of investing in stamps and art, known as Forum Filat√©lico and Afinsa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This particular scam affected over 190,000 people in Spain alone and swindled more than 2.5 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Avoiding Pyramid Schemes
Pyramid schemes have existed for over 100 years and are illegal in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. To circumvent laws, they now link a product or service as an excuse to continue operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.

[!WARNING|Red Flags]
If you encounter terms like "network marketing," "multilevel marketing," "networks," or "pyramids," it is strongly recommended to immediately distance yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

Be highly suspicious of anyone promising high [[generating_income_from_stock_market_investments | returns on the stock market]] without risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. Such a thing simply does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Your distrust should be even greater if, in addition to increasing your returns, you are required to attract new people to this "business opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>.

[!TIP|Regulation is Key]
If you intend for a company to [[analysis_of_investment_strategies_for_private_investors | invest your money]], ensure they are regulated by the highest [[investment opportunities in the stock market | stock market]] authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>. For example, in Spain, this regulator is the CNMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.

The most crucial aspect for [[challenges and strategies for stock market investing | avoiding falling into the net of these scammers]] is not to be swayed by greed and to understand that no one gives something valuable for nothing in return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

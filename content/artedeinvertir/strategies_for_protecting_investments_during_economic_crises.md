The global economic landscape is undergoing significant changes, and understanding these shifts is crucial for investors and individuals alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Renowned economist and investor Ray Dalio has indicated a specific timeframe for these profound global economic shifts, which will have serious implications for currency values (like the dollar and euro), real estate, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. Dalio has warned that this impending economic scenario will be the most significant change in society and the economy in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Economic Outlook

Ray Dalio, a highly influential figure in the economic scene, manages Bridgewater, the world's largest investment fund, overseeing over $100 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. This figure is greater than the Gross Domestic Product (GDP) of some countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. Dalio has a proven track record of accurately predicting major economic changes, enabling him to protect his investment portfolios from significant crises such as those in 2008 and the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Having become a multimillionaire, Dalio has publicly shared his research on the economy and its future, notably in his book "The New World Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. He has been actively warning society to adapt to this new economic reality to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:02:00">[02:02:00]</a>. In a recent interview, he disclosed an exact date when he believes these economic changes will commence, alongside their underlying reasons and triggers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:08:00">[02:08:00]</a>.

### Three Converging Problems

Dalio identifies three primary problems converging to create a significant economic challenge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>:

1.  **Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle:** A recession coupled with substantial social inequality is leading to societal and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:00">[02:41:00]</a>. Dalio notes that inequality between classes is fueling the rise of populist parties, which he believes will negatively impact economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>. Data shows that 90% of the American population owns increasingly less wealth, with a mere 10% owning 75% of the wealth in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this, as governments issued significant debt to salvage the economy, a burden that will fall on the working class who did not benefit from the recent economic boom in housing, stock market investments, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a>.
2.  **US Losing Competitive Advantage to China:** Dalio states that the United States, as a 75-year-old empire, is showing clear signs of decline, being in a terminal phase of its credit cycle, characterized by high debt production and excessive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Historically, the US could issue debt and print new dollars without currency collapse due to its dominant global economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:34:00">[04:34:00]</a>. However, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in GDP, global relevance (military, technological innovation, influence), and the dollar's value is no longer preserved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:00">[04:50:00]</a>. In each past crisis, printing new dollars was the solution, but a future crisis could see a loss of confidence in the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:00">[05:07:00]</a>. In 2020 alone, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed, a massive increase for a currency with a long history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:30:00">[05:30:00]</a>. China is expected to surpass the US in GDP around 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:34:00">[05:34:00]</a>.

> "Looking ahead in five years, we could see a situation where foreigners who have been lending money to the United States stop doing so and the dollar will no longer be accepted as easily around the world for making purchases. We have been spending more money than we earned. When difficult times come, society will fight among itself. The poor will want more money from the rich, and rich people will try to protect their money." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:11:00">[06:11:00]</a>

Dalio warns that the world will significantly change in the next five years, necessitating immediate action to [[strategies_for_investing_during_economic_uncertainty | protect savings and investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:20:00">[06:20:00]</a>. His research indicates that economies go through two phases: rise and decline, each defined by specific events. The US is currently entering the decline phase, characterized by high debt and alarming money printing, while China is in the ascending phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:20:00">[07:20:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Advice

When asked about the smartest decision for small investors to [[investment_strategies_to_protect_against_economic_downturns | protect their savings and investments]] and capitalize on future opportunities, Dalio offered the following advice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:32:00">[07:32:00]</a>:

1.  **Avoid Holding Liquidity:** Investors must be concerned about the value of money itself, just as they are about their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:43:00">[07:43:00]</a>. Due to extensive money printing, asset values (like stocks or gold) have risen, while inflation has appeared, reducing purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a>. Therefore, people are compelled to become investors in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:18:00">[08:18:00]</a>.

2.  **Diversify Well:** This means diversifying across countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a>. The goal is for one asset to rise when another falls, maintaining portfolio stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.

### The "Four Seasons Portfolio"

Ray Dalio's "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory, designed for his own investment management, emphasizes having a portfolio prepared for both good and bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:08:00">[09:08:00]</a>. His recommendations for asset allocation include:

*   **Stocks (40%):** In the current economic environment, characterized by high inflation expected to drop, emerging market stocks perform best, followed by small-cap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:06:00">[10:06:00]</a>. Curiously, gold, liquidity, and raw materials have some of the worst performances in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. Dalio's portfolio aligns with this, with three of his top five investments being ETFs related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:38:00">[10:38:00]</a>. Investing in emerging countries via ETFs can be a smart approach for those without deep economic or stock-specific knowledge of those regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:00:00">[11:00:00]</a>. Small-cap stocks also tend to perform well in this scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Historically, small-cap stocks have yielded over 17% annually in similar economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:14:00">[12:14:00]</a>. They offer less market following (potential for being cheap), greater growth potential, and are less accessible to large investors due to liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>.
*   **Gold (Small Percentage, Never Exceeding 10%):** Gold can be accessed through ETFs related to gold mining companies or those representing physical gold purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:32:00">[13:32:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds (Never Exceeding 40%):** This includes inflation-protected bonds, which are currently very interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a>. Bonds serve a defensive role, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:54:00">[13:54:00]</a>. However, the bond market currently shows signs of a bubble due to government money printing, leading Dalio to adopt a more conservative asset allocation in this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:00">[14:09:00]</a>.

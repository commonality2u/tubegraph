The US dollar, considered the most important currency in the world, is reportedly beginning a period of decline, a process that recent decisions by central banks and governments are expected to accelerate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This shift is anticipated to affect economies and stock markets globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>.

## The Dollar's Role as Global Reserve Currency

Currently, the dollar serves as the global foreign exchange reserve, meaning its fluctuations directly impact other currencies and economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. Data from the International Monetary Fund shows that approximately 62% of the world's money in circulation is represented by dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>. This percentage could be even higher, exceeding 70%, due to a significant number of dollarized economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

### Accelerating Devaluation

A "chilling fact" highlighting the rapid increase in dollar supply is that in 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created, a notable figure considering the currency's 200-year history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The effects of this expansion are already evident, with the dollar devaluing over 10% against the Euro in just nine months since a recent crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## From Gold Standard to Fiat Currency

Most major world currencies, including the dollar, euro, and pound, are fiat currencies, meaning they are not backed by gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Until the 1970s, every new dollar created had to be backed by a certain amount of gold deposited in the central bank <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>. This mechanism helped control inflation and currency devaluation, as gold cannot be created "out of thin air" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

This system changed in the early 1970s with the Bretton Woods Agreement, granting the Federal Reserve the ability to print as many dollars as it desires <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>. While this tool was used cautiously in previous years, 2020 saw a dramatic shift <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:49">[00:02:49]</a>.

> "If we drastically increase the supply of new dollars in circulation, the price of the currency or its value will fall, inflation will increase drastically, and the economy will collapse." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>

Since the beginning of the recent crisis in 2020, the amount of new dollars in circulation (M2 money supply) has significantly increased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. The Federal Reserve, under Chairman Jerome Powell, has even stated comfort with a higher level of inflation, indicating a continued increase in money supply and further devaluation of the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:44">[00:03:44]</a>.

## Historical Precedents of Currency Devaluation

Historically, such aggressive monetary experiments have not yielded positive results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>:
*   The Roman Empire experienced a fall in value when its currency was aggressively devalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.
*   Germany, at the beginning of the century, attempted to repay old debts by printing money, leading to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.
*   Venezuela has seen disastrous consequences for its economy due to currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.
*   Zimbabwe issued a 100 trillion dollar banknote, which now sells as a souvenir on eBay for about $80 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. At one point, money in Zimbabwe was transported in wheelbarrows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

## Expert Warnings

Several prominent investors have warned about the [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | potential economic collapse in the United States]] and the [[decline_of_the_us_dollar_as_world_reserve_currency | decline of the US Dollar as World Reserve Currency]].

### Ray Dalio

Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest investment fund, has been called the "Steve Jobs of financial markets" for his ability to anticipate economic events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He has declared that the dollar will lose value and is actively selling the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>. In a Bloomberg interview, Dalio warned that the dollar could decrease in value and cease to be the world's foreign currency reserve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>. His investment strategies include gold, inflation-protected bonds, and stocks outside the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

### Stanley Druckenmiller

Legendary investor Stanley Druckenmiller, known for consistently high annual returns, has also aggressively sold dollars, expressing high conviction that its value will decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. He stated that the "Federal Reserve Union of the Treasury," effective during the crisis, sets an unprecedented precedent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Druckenmiller foresees increased inflation over the next 5-6 years due to the dollar's devaluation and is investing in gold and mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

## Global Economic Impact

The actions of the US central bank are being replicated by central banks and economies worldwide, leading to increased printing of new euros, yen, and pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. This means that money held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:50">[00:06:50]</a>. Similarly, fixed-income investments or bonds are significantly affected by increased inflation or currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

## Investment Strategies to Hedge Against Dollar Depreciation

To [[Investment Strategies to Hedge Against Dollar Depreciation | protect capital and savings]] from the accelerated devaluation of the dollar, several strategies can be considered.

### 1. Selling Dollars (Forex Market)
One direct way to benefit from a potential drop in the dollar is to sell it in the forex market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, this involves a pair (e.g., USD/EUR), and if the counter-currency also devalues, the profit might not be substantial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>.

### 2. Investing in Real Estate
Investing in real estate properties is considered an effective hedge against currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>. However, this often requires substantial capital for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

### 3. Investing in Gold
Gold is like any other currency but with the advantage that it cannot be created out of thin air <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. As the price of gold is denominated in dollars, more dollars in circulation can lead to a rise in gold prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>. Investing in physical gold through ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) is now accessible and cost-effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **iShares Physical Gold (GLD)**: Listed on the London Stock Exchange under ticker `EGLN`, it appreciated over 40% in two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.
*   **SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)**: Listed in the US under ticker `GLD`, it has also shown good performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>.

### 4. Investing in Inflation-Protected Bonds (TIPS)
As recommended by Ray Dalio, investing in TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities) can protect against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>. If the dollar falls, inflation increases, and these bonds appreciate in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:42">[00:09:42]</a>.
*   **iShares TIPS Bond ETF (TIP)**: Listed in the US under ticker `TIP`, it appreciated over 10% year-to-date in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>.

### 5. Investing in Stocks Outside the US
Investing in stocks denominated in dollars may lead to losses from currency devaluation offsetting stock gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:18">[00:10:18]</a>. Ray Dalio has chosen this channel, investing $200 million in an ETF of emerging markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a> that invests in stocks of countries outside the US which are less indebted and do not need to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
*   **MSCI Emerging Markets ETF (EEM)**: Listed under ticker `EEM`, it also performed well in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

### 6. Investing in Large US Exporting Companies
Historically, large exporting companies from the US have been beneficiaries of currency devaluation processes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>. These companies sell products abroad, receiving more valuable foreign currency, while their costs remain denominated in a devalued dollar, leading to increased income and stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.

**Examples of Exporting Companies Benefiting from Devaluation:**
*   **Rolls-Royce (UK)**: After Brexit caused the pound to plummet more than 10%, Rolls-Royce appreciated over 30% in weeks as it exports its products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline (UK)**: This pharmaceutical company also rose by more than 20% immediately after the pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

**US Exporting Company Examples:**

*   **ExxonMobil (XOM)**:
    *   The largest oil company in the world, listed under ticker `XOM` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.
    *   Benefits from two factors: it produces raw materials (oil price goes up if dollar goes down) and exports over 50% of its products outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.
    *   Currently trading below its average price due to the oil price crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
    *   Historically, Exxon earned around $4 per share and paid a $3 dividend with normalized oil prices ($50-$65) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:24">[00:15:24]</a>.
    *   A target value of $60 per share is estimated based on a historical P/E of 15x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:41">[00:15:41]</a>.
    *   Based on its historical dividend yield of 4%, a target value of $75 per share is estimated (25 times the $3 annual dividend) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:13">[00:16:13]</a>.

*   **Pfizer (PFE)**:
    *   A leading biotechnology company listed under ticker `PFE` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.
    *   Warren Buffett has invested over $135 million in Pfizer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:14">[00:17:14]</a>.
    *   Over 50% of its sales are outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:00">[00:18:00]</a>.
    *   It is a good business with high returns on equity (consistently above 20%) and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.
    *   Pfizer expects to earn around $3 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:33">[00:18:33]</a>.
    *   The biotechnology sector typically trades at 18x earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:38">[00:18:38]</a>.
    *   A target value of $54 per share for the next year is estimated (3 dollars x 18 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

Other large US exporting companies that could perform well include Apple, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>.

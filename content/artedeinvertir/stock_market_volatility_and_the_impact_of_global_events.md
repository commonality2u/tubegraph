The global economy is currently experiencing a unique period of [[stock_market_volatility_and_investment_strategies | stock market volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. On "Black Monday," March 9th, 2020, [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stock market falls]] were witnessed that were similar to the crisis of 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Some media outlets are already predicting a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Simultaneously, oil experienced its largest fall in 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. This article analyzes what investors can do, what to expect, and emerging investment opportunities during this time of [[market_volatility_and_economic_predictions | market volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Causes of Recent Market Volatility

The significant [[understanding_stock_market_volatility_and_its_impact_on_stock_valuations | market volatility]] observed on "Black Monday" stemmed from two primary issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:40">[00:00:40]</a>:

*   **The "Problem"**: The overarching "problem" (a term used to avoid specific words for algorithmic reasons) is widely understood to be a significant economic disruptor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This has led to widespread confinement, impacting consumer spending, which accounts for 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.
*   **Oil Price Collapse**: Saudi Arabia decided to significantly increase its oil production, causing oil prices to fall by nearly 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. This was in response to Russia's refusal to agree to production cuts with OPEC amidst declining demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. This move aimed to force Russia back to negotiations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

These factors together unleashed panic among investors, leading to falls of up to 8% in the American stock market and 12% in the Italian stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Market Mechanisms and Sectoral Impact

Due to the severity of the situation, the circuit breaker mechanism was activated in the US, a measure not used for several decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. This mechanism halts all stock trading when falls exceed 7% to allow investors to regain composure and enable more orderly trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Affected Sectors

The crisis is primarily a consumer crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>. Consequently, companies with high debt or significant fixed costs have experienced the largest declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. Sectors directly affected include:

*   **Aviation**: Companies like Norwegian Air SAD have fallen over 75%, and American Airlines more than 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.
*   **Cruises**: Cruise companies have seen falls of 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>.
*   **Tourism and Hotel Companies**: These industries are particularly vulnerable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>. Air traffic and world tourism are completely halted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>.
*   **Oil Sector**: Stocks in this sector have also fallen significantly due to the collapse in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>.

## Navigating the Crisis: Investor Advice and Government Responses

### Reviewing Your Portfolio

Investors are advised to review their portfolios, particularly for highly indebted companies or those sensitive to economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. It's crucial to check for debt maturities in the near future (e.g., within three to six months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. Companies with sufficient cash on hand, bank balances, or credit lines are better positioned to meet debt repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

Companies unable to generate profits to repay debt face two options:
*   **Issuing new shares**: This is common but can lead to significant dilution for existing shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.
*   **Handing the company over to creditors**: This is worse, potentially leading to shareholders losing their entire investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>.

Despite the challenges, most companies plan for such situations and can operate for one or two quarters without generating profits if they have access to financing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

### Government and Central Bank Interventions

Governments and central banks learned from the 2008 crisis that injecting liquidity and rescuing troubled companies prevents a cascading financial collapse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Recent announcements show that the Federal Reserve and the European Central Bank are injecting substantial liquidity into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>. Governments are also offering aid; for example, Norway is committed to supporting its airline, and the US government is helping the tourism, airline, and cruise industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:01">[00:05:01]</a>.

### The Long-Term View on Oil Prices

While the collapse in oil prices initially creates concerns about bankruptcies among weaker oil companies and potential instability in the financial sector due to bank exposure to their debts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>, it can ultimately be positive for the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.

Cheaper oil translates to greater disposable income for consumers, which benefits consumption-driven economies (70% of the economy) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:25">[00:06:25]</a>. Most Western countries benefit from lower oil prices, as shown by their projected GDP impact <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. This provides a "breath of fresh air" and greater disposable income for consumers, with a positive effect in the medium and long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:02">[00:07:02]</a>.

Investors are advised to avoid cyclical raw material companies due to the dual difficulty of predicting raw material prices and company performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>.

## Wisdom from Warren Buffett

Warren Buffett provided timely advice after Black Monday, emphasizing that investors should not panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. He cautions against selling at the worst moment and avoiding overexposure to news that can lead to bad decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:48">[00:07:48]</a>.

His key advice:
*   **Don't try to guess the market**: No one knows what the market will do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. The focus should be on whether a purchase is intelligent at current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Long-term decisions**: He does not make long-term investment decisions based on the current "problem" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.
*   **Invest in quality during downturns**: Similar to his strategy during the 2008 crisis when he invested in banks like Bank of America <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>, he began buying shares of Delta Airlines, noting its solid balance sheet and strong position to weather the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. His strategy is to invest in quality companies directly affected by the problem, but possessing higher solvency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Distressed Sectors

Even in highly affected sectors like air transport and tourism, quality companies with good long-term prospects are available at attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>.

*   **Aena (Spanish Airports)**: This Spanish company holds a monopoly over the management of all Spanish airports <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>. It's a highly profitable business benefiting from future air traffic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>. Historically, airport stocks were resilient, with 70% of income coming from unregulated airport space rentals (shops, restaurants) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:08">[00:11:08]</a>. After rising from 50 to 200 euros in five years, shares have fallen to around 100 euros, trading at 10 times earnings compared to a historical 20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>. Western investors might be overreacting, as Shanghai airport shares have barely fallen and trade at 25 times earnings, indicating a return of air traffic after China controlled the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:52">[00:11:52]</a>.
*   **Autogrill (Airport/Highway Restaurants)**: This Italian company manages restaurants in airports and along highways, being a leader in its sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Despite being listed on the Italian stock exchange and directly related to the airline sector, causing shares to fall from 10 to 5 euros, it has little debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:45">[00:12:45]</a>. Once the transitory situation passes, air traffic will return, and the company is expected to resume growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>. Autogrill maintained sales and profits during difficult years like 2008 and 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>. Under normal conditions, its shares should trade at a minimum of 12 euros, with a future target price of 15 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>.
*   **Amadeus (IT Infrastructure for Flight Sales)**: This Spanish company holds a monopoly over the IT infrastructure for flight sales and reservations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:05">[00:14:05]</a>. It's a predictable, high-quality business with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>. Since its IPO in 2010 at 12 euros, shares had risen to 70 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. Currently, they have fallen vertically to just over 40 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:34">[00:14:34]</a>. Its current PER (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) is an attractive 14 times, significantly lower than its normal range of 20-25 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>. Its current value is estimated above 80 euros per share, expanding to over 100 euros in 2-3 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:50">[00:14:50]</a>.

## Conclusion

It is crucial for investors to remain calm and not let emotions dictate decisions during periods of [[current_economic_risks_and_their_impact_on_the_stock_market | stock market volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:59">[00:14:59]</a>. The stock market has historically overcome major global events, including two world wars, periods of hyperinflation and deflation, and several financial crises, always continuing its path <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:03">[00:15:03]</a>. This time will be no different <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a>. As J.P. Morgan famously stated, "in bear markets, stocks return to their rightful owners" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

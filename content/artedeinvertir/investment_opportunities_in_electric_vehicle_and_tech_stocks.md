This article explores investment opportunities within the electric vehicle and technology sectors, including specific companies and general market observations.

## Investment in Electric Vehicle Companies

The strong performance of companies like [[Investment opportunities and analysis of Tesla Uber and AstraZeneca | Tesla]] has led to market euphoria and the emergence of similar investments promising to be "the next [[Investment opportunities and analysis of Tesla Uber and AstraZeneca | Tesla]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. This pattern of speculation is common during periods of market excitement, similar to the cryptocurrency boom in 2017 where many new currencies emerged, most of which later lost significant value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>.

### Nio (N)

Nio, often described as "the [[Investment opportunities and analysis of Tesla Uber and AstraZeneca | Tesla]] of China," is listed in the US under the ticker N at a price of $13 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:27:00">[06:27:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:31:00">[06:31:00]</a>.
Its shares have multiplied tenfold on the stock market in less than nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:27:00">[07:27:00]</a>, following a similar pattern to other electric vehicle producers like Nikola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.

Comparing Nio's current valuation:
*   Nio's market valuation is $15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:29:00">[08:29:00]</a>.
*   In the past year, Nio sold only 20,000 vehicles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:41:00">[08:41:00]</a> and had a turnover of approximately $1 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:43:00">[08:43:00]</a>.
*   The company reported losses exceeding $1.6 billion, a figure greater than its total income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   In contrast, Fiat Chrysler, with the same market capitalization, sells over a million cars annually, has sales 100 times greater ($100 billion), and reported annual profits of over $6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. Despite these differences, the market values these two companies similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:00">[09:14:00]</a>.

### Fisker

Fisker, an electric vehicle company, went bankrupt in 2016 due to large operating losses and poor product quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:48:00">[07:48:00]</a>. Despite this, a group of financiers acquired the bankrupt company, updated its products, and plans to take it public again at a valuation of $4 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. The original Fisker models were criticized for terrible technology compared to [[Investment opportunities and analysis of Tesla Uber and AstraZeneca | Tesla]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>. However, due to the current euphoria in electric vehicle stocks, it is expected that the shares will likely rise after being taken public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>.

## Investment in Tech Companies

### Mercado Libre (ML)

Mercado Libre, often called the "Amazon of Latin America," is listed in the US under the ticker ML at $950 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:53:00">[12:53:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:59:00">[12:59:00]</a>. It is considered a high-quality business that has experienced tremendous growth, with billing increasing from $600 million to an expected $3 billion for the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:05:00">[13:05:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:10:00">[13:10:00]</a>. However, its profits have turned to losses, from positive $150 million to losses of $170 million in the last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:00">[13:17:00]</a>.

#### Valuation Comparison to Amazon

To contextualize Mercado Libre's current valuation, it can be compared to Amazon during the dot-com bubble 20 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:24:00">[13:24:00]</a>.
*   **Amazon (20 years ago):** Similar to Mercado Libre today, Amazon saw its turnover increase from $600 million to $3 billion in a few years and produced losses around $150 million annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:42:00">[13:42:00]</a>. During the dot-com bubble, Amazon was valued at $24 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>. After this period, Amazon's share price dropped by 80%, and shareholders took eight years to recover their investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:08:00">[14:08:00]</a>.
*   **Mercado Libre (today):** Currently, Mercado Libre has reached a valuation of $48 billion, which is double Amazon's valuation during a similar growth and loss phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:01:00">[14:01:00]</a>.

## General Investment Principles

It is crucial to remember that a good company does not necessarily equate to a good investment if its valuation is unreasonable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>. Conversely, companies that are not exceptional can become good [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investments]] if listed at a very attractive valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a>. While valuation may seem irrelevant in the short term, it is a determining factor for long-term performance, alongside business performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:08:00">[06:08:00]</a>.

As investors, it is essential to protect capital as it is the primary tool for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>. Informed [[Investment opportunities and strategies | investment decisions]] are crucial, rather than being swayed by emotions or stock market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>. The stock market often operates at extremes of euphoria or pessimism, rather than equilibrium <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>.

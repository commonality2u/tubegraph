Ray Dalio, a renowned economist and investor, has highlighted [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | economic inequality]] and class struggle as one of three unprecedented problems facing the world, which he believes will lead to a new economic recession and a "new world order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. These challenges are considered by Dalio to be the most important of our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Dalio's insights are highly respected, as he founded the world's largest hedge fund with over $100 trillion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:00">[01:19:00]</a> and has successfully navigated major economic crises like those in 2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. His recent book, "The New World Order," condenses his views on these serious [[economic_inequality_and_its_implications | economic changes]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:48:00">[01:48:00]</a>.

## The Problem of Class Struggle

According to Dalio, one of the three major forces at play is a "class struggle" between capitalism and communism, and between "those who have and those who don't," with both sides seeking to win at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:00">[02:15:00]</a>. He identifies the growing social gap between classes as a primary concern that will generate future tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

A graph presented in the discussion illustrates how 1% of the American population is accumulating increasing [[wealth_inequality_and_its_effects_on_the_economy | wealth]], while the poorest 50% own progressively less wealth and fewer assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. The recent inflation crisis has exacerbated this gap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>. The poorest 50% often do not own assets such as stocks or real estate that offer protection against inflation, thus bearing the full impact of this economic problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>.

## Connection to Debt and Inflation

Dalio links the problem of class struggle to the enormous debt held by the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>. He warns that if governments choose to print more money to solve recessions, it will lead to higher inflation, further increasing the disparity between "those who have and those who do not" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.

### Dalio's Prediction
Ray Dalio predicts that "in 5 years we will see a totally different world than the current one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>. This change is attributed to a combination of factors, including the rise of China, the ongoing class struggle, and the debt bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:00">[03:58:00]</a>. Technological advancements like Artificial Intelligence are also expected to contribute to unpredictable scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>.

## Recommendations for Investors

Given this complex environment, Dalio offers [[investment_education_and_strategies | investment advice]] for small investors:

### Global and Diversified Investment
Dalio advises looking at investments globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:00">[05:25:00]</a>. The primary goal should be to prevent money from losing value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>. He suggests that investing is the only way to protect against inflation, as the value of assets like stocks and gold has risen due to new debt and money creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

> "You do not want to have things that you think are safe such as liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:41:00">[05:41:00]</a>

Dalio specifically advises against investments previously considered safe, such as fixed income and liquidity, as their value is likely to decrease in inflationary scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:48:00">[05:48:00]</a>. Instead, he recommends real assets for which there is always demand, such as:
*   Stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>
*   Real estate investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>
*   Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:00">[06:10:00]</a>

He also emphasizes the [[the_importance_of_economic_discipline_and_compound_interest | importance of diversification]] in a world with high uncertainty and risks, stating that good diversification can reduce risk by 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a>. Dalio typically recommends investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:35:00">[06:35:00]</a>. He popularized the "Four Seasons" portfolio management theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

### Dalio's Current Investments
As of his last published portfolio, Dalio's preferred sector for investment is technology, with holdings in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Conversely, he has been selling positions in the banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, due to their sensitivity to the economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>. While he typically holds a significant portion of his portfolio in long-term bonds, his current main positions are in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a>.

Another sector Dalio favors in this environment is stable or defensive consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>. He has also invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF (IWM), which includes 2,000 small-cap companies in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:00">[08:22:00]</a>. Historically, these small-cap stocks tend to perform better than the market average and large companies when interest rates drop and liquidity increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

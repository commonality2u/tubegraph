The company is known for treating its shareholders well, returning most of its profits through dividends or share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:00">[01:43:00]</a>.

## Growth in the 5G Market

Future growth for Qualcomm is anticipated to come from the 5G market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>. The company possesses some of the best products within the 5G sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

## Investment Considerations

The [[Staal_Duk_Miller | famous investor Staal Duk Miller]] recently invested $30 million in Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. When [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuing]] a [[emerging_sectors_and_trends_in_the_fourth_industrial_revolution | technology]] company like Qualcomm, it is recommended to use the free cash flow per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. It is estimated that by 2023, the free cash flow will be around $6 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. Historically, Qualcomm has traded at 20 times its earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:00">[01:15:00]</a>. Based on these figures, a target price of $120 per share in three years can be projected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>.

At its current trading price of $84 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:50">[01:44:50]</a>, Qualcomm offers an interesting realization potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>, especially considering it is a low-risk company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

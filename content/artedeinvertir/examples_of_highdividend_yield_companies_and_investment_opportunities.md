Many people wonder if it's possible to live off the [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] and achieve a predictable, increasing income over time, and the answer is yes, with certain nuances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>.

## Ways to Make Money from Stocks

There are two primary ways to generate income from [[investment_opportunities_in_equities | stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>:

1.  **Revaluation**: This common method involves buying a stock to sell it later at a higher price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:48">[00:00:48]</a>. The challenge is that it relies on future investors being willing to pay more, leading to less predictable and more volatile results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>.
2.  **Dividends**: This method offers a much more predictable way to generate income from the [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. Certain companies periodically distribute a portion of their profits to shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. The advantage is not depending on other investors to pay more for shares; instead, it relies on correctly analyzing the company's ability to generate stable and growing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>. This approach can lead to more predictable income, helping to achieve profitability targets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Companies often reinvest a portion of their profits back into the business, which can also lead to future revaluation alongside dividend income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:10">[00:03:10]</a>.

## Building a Dividend-Focused Investment Portfolio

To achieve a consistent income objective, academic studies suggest investing in at least six different sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. It is also advisable for a portfolio to contain between 15 and 20 shares that meet the desired profitability objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>.

A positive aspect of this investment philosophy is that the focus remains on the dividends a company will pay in the future, rather than fluctuating stock market prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:50">[00:02:50]</a>.

## Finding High-Dividend Stocks

Identifying suitable shares among the many listed on the [[investment_opportunities_in_the_stock_market | stock market]] can be done using free tools <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>.

### Investing.com Stock Screener

The website Investing.com offers a useful "stock screener" tool <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. Filters can be applied to find companies based on specific criteria:

*   **Dividend Yield**: A range between 6% and 10% is recommended, as yields above 10% are often unsustainable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.
*   **Dividend Growth**: Set the lower limit to 0% to avoid companies that have historically reduced their dividends, and the upper limit to 10% average annual growth, as aggressive growth with high yield is rare <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:26">[00:04:26]</a>.

This filter can be applied to various regions globally, such as the Canadian market, where many high-dividend yield companies exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:10">[00:05:10]</a>.

### Other Research Tools

*   **Si Kim Alfa Dot Com**: Useful for researching dividend stocks, especially for observing historical dividend growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   **Market Screamer**: In the finance section, it shows expected dividend payments for the next two years, allowing monitoring for stability or growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">[00:09:21]</a>.

## Investment Capital Required

To achieve an average daily profitability objective of $100 or €100 (equivalent to $3,000 per month or $36,000 annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>:

*   A realistic dividend yield objective is between 6% and 8% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.
*   The ideal approach is to form a portfolio with an average dividend yield of around 7%, diversified across different economic sectors, and composed of 15-20 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.

The formula to calculate the required investment capital is:
**(Annual Benefit Expected) x (1 / Expected Portfolio Profitability)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>

For a $36,000 annual target with a 7% portfolio yield:
$36,000 x (1 / 0.07) = $36,000 x 14.28 ≈ $514,080 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. This means approximately $504,000 is needed to reach the target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>.

Lowering the daily performance expectation, for example to $50, would reduce the required capital by half, to about $250,000 or €250,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:37">[00:07:37]</a>.

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

Companies automatically send dividend payments to your third-party broker account, typically monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>.

Dividends are generally taxed between 20% and 25% in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:02">[00:08:02]</a>. When receiving dividends from outside your tax residence country, a "withholding tax" or "wheat holding tax" can result in double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. In the United States, the W8BN form, often provided by brokers like Interactive Brokers, helps avoid this double taxation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>.

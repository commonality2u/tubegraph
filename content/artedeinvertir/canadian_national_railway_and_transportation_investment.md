## Company Overview and Strategic Mergers
Canadian National Railway is a dominant rail transport company in Canada. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a> It recently merged with Kansas City Southern, a U.S. company, to create a North American axis. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:45">[00:26:45]</a> This merger established a strong presence from southern Canada, connecting down to the Texas area and the Gulf of Mexico, crucial for the transportation and export of raw materials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:47">[00:26:47]</a>

The company transports a wide array of goods, including:
*   Raw materials like coal, iron ore, copper, and aluminum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:12">[00:27:12]</a>
*   Oil in adapted wagons <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:18">[00:27:18]</a>
*   Industrial merchandise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:25">[00:27:25]</a>
*   Grains, fertilizers, and forestry materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:25">[00:29:25]</a>
*   Metals and mining products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:32">[00:29:32]</a>
*   Intermodal containers, which are standardized containers loaded onto both trains and ships <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>

Rail transport remains a cost-effective means for very heavy merchandise that does not require immediate delivery, offering low costs for large volumes compared to other transport methods. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:30">[00:27:30]</a>

## Market Position and Competitive Advantage
The rail transport sector in North America is controlled by a handful of companies, with Canadian National Railway being one of the market leaders. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:56">[00:27:56]</a> This concentrated market structure allows these companies to set prices, giving them a strong dominant force. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:03">[00:28:03]</a> The business is largely non-cyclical because the volume of transportation is consistently needed as human beings consume, making demand predictable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a> Unlike companies involved in extraction, which are heavily affected by raw material prices, transport companies are primarily influenced by demand, which tends to be constant. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:22">[00:28:22]</a>

Creating a parallel railway line to an existing one is extremely difficult and requires complex licensing, which makes these businesses operate as local monopolies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a> This characteristic is highly valued by investors like Warren Buffett, who also owns a major railway company, BNSF. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:28">[00:30:28]</a> Canadian National Railway holds a 14% market share, competing with companies like Union Pacific, another strong performer in the sector. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:52">[00:30:52]</a> The overall strength of companies in this sector suggests a favorable underlying market structure. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:02">[00:31:02]</a>

## Financial Performance and Shareholder Returns
Canadian National Railway has demonstrated impressive long-term performance, with its stock multiplying almost 100 times over 25 years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:50">[00:29:50]</a> The stock has also shown very low volatility, behaving predictably with minimal corrections even during crises like 2008. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>

A common element among Bill Gates' investments, including CNR, is a solid and growing dividend payment, which is highly predictable. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:02">[00:32:02]</a> Additionally, many of these companies return money to shareholders through share buybacks. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:17">[00:32:17]</a> Canadian National Railway had a record year for share buybacks in 2022, indicating management believes its shares are an attractive investment. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:24">[00:32:24]</a>

The company aims to reach $8 of earnings per share within the next three years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a> While Bill Gates' investments typically don't target companies with revenue growth exceeding 10%, he prioritizes those with double-digit earnings per share growth. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:07">[00:33:07]</a> Canadian National Railway is expected to grow annual profit between 10% and 15%, which the stock market tends to reflect. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a> This makes it appealing to dividend investors as well. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:25">[00:33:25]</a>

Despite a slight decrease in profit growth in 2023 due to a dip in raw material prices and increased operating costs, analysts project a recovery and new record profits in the coming three years. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:49">[00:33:49]</a>

## Valuation
Bill Gates' [[analysis_of_investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_including_technology_and_transport | investment approach]] consistently involves not overpaying for companies. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a> Canadian National Railway currently trades at 20 times earnings, which is in line with its historical 5-year average. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:33">[00:34:33]</a> While it has traded as low as 16 times earnings during periods of fear or crisis, it's not currently at an obviously expensive valuation. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>

## Key Characteristics of Investment
CNR embodies several common characteristics seen in Bill Gates' major investments:
*   **Market Leadership**: It is among the best businesses in its industry. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:16">[00:50:16]</a>
*   **Reasonable Valuation**: Shares are not overly expensive. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:20">[00:50:20]</a>
*   **Low Debt**: The company is managed prudently with a focus on stable financials. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>
*   **Double-Digit Profit Growth**: It has clear growth plans, especially in terms of profit, even if sales growth is more modest. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:22">[00:50:22]</a> This is consistent with Gates' focus on earnings per share growth rather than just revenue. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:09">[00:33:09]</a>
*   **Predictable and Essential Services**: Like [[john_deere_and_agricultural_machinery_investment | John Deere]], [[caterpillar_and_infrastructure_investment | Caterpillar]], and Waste Management, CNR provides services that humans will always need. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:11">[01:06:11]</a>
*   **Concentrated Portfolio**: Gates prefers to concentrate his [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] in a few strong companies rather than a widely diversified portfolio. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:14">[00:25:14]</a>

This investment strategy, focusing on quality, predictability, and growth at a reasonable price, has yielded strong results for Bill Gates. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:37">[01:06:37]</a>

The current global situation, particularly the conflict in Ukraine, has entered an "economic war" phase that will affect everyone, regardless of investment status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. Financial ministers have warned that the series of measures being taken by countries will have significant economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Economic Consequences and Risks

One of the most significant immediate economic consequences is the substantial rise in oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>. This is considered the primary factor that will have the most weight in the current situation regarding gas and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

### Oil Prices and Economic Recessions

Rising oil prices can worsen existing [[energy_crisis_and_its_impact_on_inflation | inflationary pressures]] that have already caused stock market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>. Historically, there is a high correlation between rising oil prices and economic recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>.

A graph illustrating Brent crude oil prices adjusted for inflation shows that when the price has exceeded a critical level of $100, economic recessions have occurred, as seen in 2001, 2008, and nearly in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. The correlation exists because [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflationary pressures]] reduce people's disposable income, leading to less consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Since most of the economy is driven by consumption, reduced spending causes company earnings to drop, the stock market to decline, and the economy to suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

### Impact of Sanctions

Previous economic measures, such as when Russia invaded Crimea, led to a 30% collapse in Russia's GDP <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. However, the current situation is more severe as its [[effects_of_global_policies_on_inflation_and_energy_prices | economic consequences]] could extend to Europe and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>.

The exclusion of Russia from the SWIFT international money transfer system, enacted by the US, Canada, and other countries, is a significant measure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>. Although this blocks Russia, the German finance minister warned that it would have severe [[impact_of_global_economic_conditions_on_markets | economic consequences]] for Germany, the rest of Europe, and the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:56">[00:05:56]</a>. The German government specifically warned that suspending the SWIFT system would have a "massive impact" on German businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:02">[01:09:02]</a>.

If the conflict escalates further and these measures continue, there could be short- and medium-term effects on global markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:07">[01:11:07]</a>.

### Affected Sectors and Companies

Companies with significant exposure to the Russian market will be negatively impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:03">[01:03:03]</a>. If Russia is excluded from the SWIFT system, a large percentage of sales could "evaporate" for companies that export or trade with Russia or its allies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:47">[01:03:47]</a>. Due to operating leverage, a 10% loss in sales could result in a 30-60% drop in profits, which the stock market will reflect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:00">[01:04:00]</a>.

Examples of companies with substantial sales in Russia:
*   **Coca-Cola bottler (Greek)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:12">[01:07:12]</a>
*   **Carlsberg** (beer company) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>
*   **Inditex** (owner of Zara) - around 10-12% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:24">[01:07:24]</a>
*   **Renault** (car company) - over 8% of sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>
*   **Philip Morris** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>

Luxury brands like Ferrari and Louis Vuitton have also seen declines due to their proximity to the conflict, especially with their exposure to the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:29">[01:45:29]</a>. The Chinese market represents 25-30% of sales for Louis Vuitton, while the Russian market accounts for 5-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:01">[01:47:01]</a>.

Companies with engineers in Eastern European countries, like Ukraine, could also be affected, though relocation might mitigate some losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:46">[01:54:46]</a>.

### Benefiting Sectors and Companies

Some sectors and companies have positively benefited from the situation:
*   **Energy Sector**: Companies like Cheniere Energy, which exports liquefied gas, have a near monopoly on cheap shale oil gas and are set to benefit from rising energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:04">[01:15:04]</a>. Marathon Oil, an oil exploration and production company, has seen positive returns even as other sectors decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:01">[01:30:01]</a>. Oil companies' value depends on management returning money, reserves, and low breakeven costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:06">[01:33:06]</a>. Marathon Oil, for instance, has a breakeven of $35 per barrel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:58">[01:33:58]</a>. It's difficult for oil prices to fall below $50-$55, as this would destroy supply from less efficient producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>.
*   **Raw Material Companies**: Given that Russia is a major exporter of fertilizers, companies like Mosaic (fertilizer producers) could see increased sales and profits if Russia is excluded from international trade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:57">[01:15:57]</a>.
*   **Defense Sector**: The defense sector is expected to benefit significantly. Germany, for example, is planning to drastically increase its defense spending from 1.3% of GDP and potentially double it in the medium term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:41">[01:16:41]</a>. This will lead to increased purchases of state-of-the-art equipment from companies like Lockheed Martin and Northrop Grumman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:56">[01:16:56]</a>.
*   **Government Subcontractors**: Companies providing technological, logistical, and cybersecurity support to the government in the defense sector, such as KBR International and Leidos, also benefit during conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:42">[01:17:42]</a>.

### Investment Outlook

In an [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflationary environment]], companies with "pricing power" (ability to raise prices without losing customers) tend to fare well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:22">[01:38:22]</a>. However, if inflation normalizes in the second half of the year, cyclical commodity companies might not perform as strongly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:33">[01:38:33]</a>. Good businesses, generally, tend to prosper across various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:44">[01:38:44]</a>.

Despite current volatility, historical data suggests that war conflicts have a limited negative effect on the long-term stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:03">[02:00:03]</a>. Drops of 10-20% in the short term are common during such events, but the long-term impact tends to be null <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:06">[02:00:06]</a>. Investing when the market has experienced corrections (falls of over 10%) often leads to excess returns in one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:51">[02:00:51]</a>. When a majority of investors turn bearish, it historically signals the best time to invest, as stocks are cheaper when pessimism is high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:50">[02:00:50]</a>.

The stock market has proven resilient, even surviving events like World War II, with studies showing a better average return during that period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:22">[02:24:22]</a>. The current price of assets already reflects known negative news, so if the situation resolves without further escalation, companies are expected to recover their profit levels, and investor confidence will return, leading to asset prices returning to previous levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:45">[02:24:45]</a>.

It is important for investors to maintain balance, not to be naive about market impacts, and to understand that patience is key. Market fears typically last a year or two, and long-term wealth is built by investing in good companies with growth at reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:56">[02:29:56]</a>.

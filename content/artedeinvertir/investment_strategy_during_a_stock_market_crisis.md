Navigating a stock market crisis requires specific strategies and an understanding of underlying economic forces. Experts like Ray Dalio and François Rosón offer insights into how to approach investing during periods of market uncertainty.

## Current Market Outlook and Risks
Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater team predict a new risk for the stock market in September, potentially leading to an additional drop of 20% to 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The market is currently estimating a drop in inflation without a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>. However, Dalio anticipates a drop in inflation *with* a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> and expects inflation to be more persistent than what the market is currently anticipating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. This will significantly impact monetary policies and Fed rate forecasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

Bridgewater has been reducing its stock holdings and rotating portfolios into safer assets, expecting drops of 20-25% with the withdrawal of stimulus in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

Three major risks are currently present in the markets for the next 6-12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
1.  **Pressure from Multiples**: The S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple has fallen from 24 times earnings to about 17 times, which is currently at the historical average, assuming 5-6% interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. This risk is largely implicit in current prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
2.  **Drop in Corporate Profits**: A 10-20% drop in profits, typical during a recession, would artificially inflate the multiple and negatively impact stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. This risk is not yet fully implicit in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>.
3.  **System Liquidity (Quantitative Tightening - QT)**: The Federal Reserve (Fed) is withdrawing money from the system, which is the opposite of quantitative easing (money printing) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Starting in September, a monthly withdrawal of $90-95 billion (nearly a trillion annually) will fully enter play <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Historically, periods of money withdrawal (QT) have seen the market perform worse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>.

These risks are closely correlated: raising rates quickly can cause a recession, leading to profit drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. If rates are not raised aggressively, inflation problems persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. It's likely at least two of these three risks will materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>.

September has historically been the month when the stock market drops the most, making it one of the best months to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:01">[01:03:01]</a>.

## [[Investment strategies during a financial crisis | Investment Strategies During a Crisis]]
Ray Dalio suggests that investors cannot completely avoid the impacts of a market downturn, as it will affect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:06">[01:34:06]</a>. Key advice includes:
*   **Reduce Risks**: Prioritize risk reduction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:58">[01:39:58]</a>.
*   **Global Diversification**: Diversify at the asset level, including bonds and quality stocks, rather than solely focusing on regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.
*   **Quality Stocks**: Focus on companies that are non-cyclical, have low debt, and demonstrate consistent profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:12">[01:40:12]</a>.
*   **Sectoral Diversification**: Avoid sectors highly sensitive to economic cycles or profit drops, such as:
    *   Automobile companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:42:58">[01:42:58]</a>
    *   Banks and insurance companies (though some can be good if high quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:18">[01:43:18]</a>
    *   Construction companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:33">[01:43:33]</a>
    *   Transportation companies (e.g., airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:43:36">[01:43:36]</a>
    *   Raw material and materials companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:57">[01:44:57]</a>
    *   Companies with debt and cyclical sensitivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:42">[01:44:42]</a>

### Positive News and Opportunities
Despite the challenges, the market also presents opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. Inflation in the US is expected to moderate by May-June of next year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:53">[01:55:53]</a>. European markets have seen valuations drop to levels similar to the 2020 confinement, and individual shares have significantly lower valuations, which is good for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:00">[02:16:00]</a>.

In a crisis, the market often rebounds quickly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:59">[02:18:59]</a>. When people are most discouraged about the stock market and less willing to invest, it is precisely the time when it is more interesting to do so <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:55">[02:43:55]</a>.

### Lessons from François Rosón (Giverny Capital)
François Rosón, a successful Canadian money manager, emphasizes a replicable style suitable for individual investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:05">[03:09:05]</a>. His investment philosophy focuses on:
*   **Long-Term Focus**: Investing only for the long term, expecting shares to perform without using short positions or derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:04">[03:33:04]</a>.
*   **Diversified Portfolio**: Typically holding 15-25 companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:09">[03:41:09]</a>.
*   **Quality Companies**: Investing in profitable, quality companies with certain growth, low cyclicality, and reasonable multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:41:59">[03:41:59]</a>. He avoids speculative, unprofitable companies that abuse shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:23">[03:42:23]</a>.
*   **Predicting Future Earnings**: The most crucial aspect is knowing what a company will earn in five to ten years and only investing in those where you have a very strong opinion that this will be the case <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:06">[03:13:06]</a>.
    *   This involves assessing company strength, market size and growth, market share, and the company's strategy for reinvesting profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:42">[03:22:42]</a>.
*   **Value Creation Formula**: Stock price performance in the long term respects the formula: Increase in Profits + Shareholder Yield (dividends + share buybacks - share issuance) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:48">[03:46:48]</a>. The biggest component is how earnings evolve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:50:58">[03:50:58]</a>.
*   **Mistakes to Avoid**:
    *   **Errors of Omission**: Failing to buy something that performs well due to perceived high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:19">[04:54:19]</a>. If a good company is quoted at a reasonable valuation (e.g., 18 times profits, not 100 or 200), buy it even if it moves slightly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>.
    *   **Overthinking Short-Term Price Fluctuations**: A slight increase in price for a good company doesn't matter if you expect it to double or triple over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:59">[05:14:59]</a>.
*   **Investing in Strong Sectors**: Look for companies in sectors with "tailwinds" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:35">[01:58:35]</a>.
*   **Do Not Use Stop-Loss**: Professionals do not use stop-loss orders in investing because they are a "fool's errand" and don't protect against large gaps in price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:05">[07:05:05]</a>.

### Examples of Preferred Companies
François Rosón's portfolio includes high-quality companies that demonstrate consistent performance:
*   **Floor & Decor (FND)**: A home improvement retailer that has multiplied its earnings per share five times in seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:40:07">[05:40:07]</a>. It thrives by selling impulse items and branded products at low prices, making it resistant to online competition due to shipping costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:35">[05:50:35]</a>.
*   **Progressive Corporation (PGR)**: A low-cost auto insurer that has multiplied by almost 600 times since going public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:46">[05:51:46]</a>. Its competitive advantage lies in low costs, similar to Warren Buffett's investment in Geico <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:10:48">[06:10:48]</a>. Insurers benefit from "float" (money paid in advance by clients) that can be invested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:24:24">[06:24:24]</a>. They are also less affected by economic cycles as car insurance is mandatory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:39:15">[06:39:15]</a>.
*   **CarMax (KMX)**: This company professionalized the used car sales sector in the US by offering fixed, fair prices and transparency, building trust and a strong brand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:16">[07:59:16]</a>. It continues to capture market share in a gigantic market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:22:50">[08:22:50]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy for All Market Conditions
It's essential to continually learn and improve as an investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:26:07">[07:26:07]</a>. Successful [[investment strategies for economic crises | investment strategies for economic crises]] or any market condition are not about blindly copying others but understanding the method and applying it to your own decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:25:06">[05:25:06]</a>. This means focusing on **predicting future earnings**, understanding **competitive advantages**, and managing **risk levels** of individual actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:03">[05:44:03]</a>.

The worse the situation in the markets, the faster it tends to turn around <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:04">[02:18:04]</a>. Rapid increases follow periods of decline, making it crucial to be prepared and continue learning during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. Investors who quit during losses miss out on future bullish markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:07">[02:57:07]</a>.

This [[investment strategies during economic instability | investment strategies during economic instability]] period and [[investment strategies during market uncertainty | investment strategies during market uncertainty]] highlights that market movements are not random but have explanations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:49">[04:18:49]</a>. While short-term volatility exists, over five to ten years, the market tends to balance out, and stock valuations will likely be significantly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:05">[04:25:05]</a>.

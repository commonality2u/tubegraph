The All Weather Portfolio, also known as the Four Seasons Portfolio, is an [[Investment strategies and advice | investment method]] designed to provide positive returns across various economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Created by Ray Dalio, one of the world's most [[Investment strategies of Successful Investors | successful investors]] and the largest [[Investment funds and portfolio management | investment fund]] manager, this strategy has historically delivered an average annual return of 7% and performs exceptionally well during stock market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>.

## Ray Dalio: The Architect of Innovation

Ray Dalio is regarded as an innovator in the financial markets, having introduced multiple advancements to the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. He began managing just $10,000 from his apartment over 45 years ago <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. His [[Investment funds and portfolio management | investment fund]], Bridgewater, now manages over $130 billion, making it the largest in the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Due to the tremendous success and predictable, low-risk results of the All Weather Portfolio, Dalio made this system public for any investor to use <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

## All Weather Portfolio Philosophy

Dalio's approach to [[Investment strategies and philosophies | investment strategies and philosophies]] evolved from attempting to predict economic fluctuations, which he found to be impossible due to numerous correlated variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>. Embracing simplicity, much like in science, he identified that the two primary variables affecting the stock market's behavior are inflation and economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>.

These two variables can exist in two states (high/low inflation and high/low economic growth), leading to four distinct "economic seasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. The All Weather Portfolio is designed to perform well in each of these scenarios, ensuring resilience regardless of market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>. Dalio likens the economy to weather: we know it will rain or snow, but not the exact timing, so we must build portfolios that can withstand any economic phenomenon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:59">[00:06:59]</a>.

## Performance and Resilience

The All Weather Portfolio has demonstrated remarkable stability and returns:
*   Over the last 30 years, it has only produced losses in four years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.
*   The maximum annual loss recorded was only 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:15">[00:02:15]</a>.
*   It has provided an average annual return of over 7%, effectively doubling assets every 10 years without significant effort beyond buying and holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>.

### Performance During Market Crises

The portfolio's most significant advantage is its resilience during volatile periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:29">[00:03:29]</a>.
*   **2008 Financial Crisis**: The All Weather system experienced temporary losses of 12% between July 2008 and February 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:05">[00:04:05]</a>. In contrast, the American stock market fell by 60% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:14">[00:04:14]</a>. The portfolio recovered its losses in less than seven months, while the American stock market took four years to return to pre-crisis levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>.
*   **2020 Crisis**: In March 2020, the portfolio's maximum fall was 2.3%, while the American stock market dropped 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. All losses were recovered in just one month <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.

### The Four Economic Seasons and Corresponding Assets

Ray Dalio recommends primarily working with four asset classes: stocks, bonds, commodities, and gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

1.  **High Economic Growth**:
    *   **Performance**: Stocks and commodities perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.
    *   **Why**: Corporate profits increase (stocks), and demand for raw materials rises (commodities) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:42">[00:07:42]</a>.
    *   **Example**: In 2019, large-cap American stocks rose over 30%, and commodities like gold rose over 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>.

2.  **Low Economic Growth**:
    *   **Performance**: Bonds perform very well, while stocks and commodities do poorly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:19">[00:08:19]</a>.
    *   **Why**: Bonds are safe and conservative, acting as a refuge in difficult market times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>.
    *   **Example**: In 2020, 20-year American government bonds appreciated over 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

3.  **Accelerating Inflation**:
    *   **Performance**: Raw materials and gold are star assets; stocks do moderately well; bonds suffer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>.
    *   **Philosophy**: The portfolio is designed so some assets thrive while others merely maintain value or suffer minor losses, ensuring overall satisfactory performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

4.  **Downward Inflation**:
    *   **Performance**: Bonds do quite well, stocks behave satisfactorily, while raw materials and gold do not perform as well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

## Asset Allocation for Small Investors

Ray Dalio's original All Weather Portfolio [[analysis_of_investment_strategies_for_private_investors | asset allocation]] recommendations for small investors, typically replicated through ETFs:

1.  **Large-Cap American Stocks**: 30% weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
    *   **Replication**: SPDR S&P 500 ETF (Ticker: SPY), representing the 500 largest American companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. As of the transcript, priced at $317 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

2.  **Long-Term American Bonds**: 40% weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:22">[00:10:22]</a>.
    *   **Replication**: iShares 20+ Year Treasury Bond ETF (Ticker: TLT), priced at $160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

3.  **Medium-Term American Bonds**: 15% weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.
    *   **Replication**: iShares 7-10 Year Treasury Bond ETF (Ticker: IEF), priced at $133 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This allows small investors to access the bond market, which often requires high minimum capital investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:59">[00:10:59]</a>.

4.  **Commodities**: 7.5% weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.
    *   **Replication**: iShares S&P GSCI Commodity-Indexed Trust (Ticker: GSG), priced at $10.70 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:27">[00:11:27]</a>. This ETF includes various commodities like oil (almost 40%), aluminum, natural gas, and live cattle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a>.

5.  **Gold**: 7.5% weighting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:55">[00:11:55]</a>.
    *   **Replication**: SPDR Gold Shares (Ticker: GLD), the world's largest gold ETF, priced at $169 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:59">[00:11:59]</a>. This ETF holds an incredible $50 billion in gold, with 45 tons deposited in the Bank of England <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>.

## Rebalancing the Portfolio

A crucial step for this [[Investment strategies and asset allocation | investment method]] to work effectively is to rebalance the portfolio every 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>. This ensures that assets return to their original recommended weightings within the Four Seasons strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Current Portfolio Adjustments

While Ray Dalio continues to use his Four Seasons strategy for his [[Investment funds and portfolio management | investment funds]], he has been applying certain adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>. His investment portfolio is public, allowing small investors to observe these changes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:16">[00:13:16]</a>.

His firm, Bridgewater, shows current main positions:
*   **Large-Cap Stocks**: Roughly 18% in SPDR S&P 500 ETF (Ticker: SPY) and an additional 6% in iShares Core S&P 500 ETF (Ticker: IVV), totaling 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>.
*   **International Stocks**: Investing in ETFs for international stocks, such as the iShares MSCI India ETF (Ticker: INDA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   **Emerging Market Stocks**: Over 6% of the portfolio in ETFs from emerging countries or those representing large-cap stocks from countries like Brazil or Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Holds the GLD ETF with a weight greater than 11%, plus another gold ETF at 4%, bringing his total gold allocation to over 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:26">[00:14:26]</a>. This is double the original recommendation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>.

From these observations, three main changes are deduced:
1.  Slightly reduced the weight in bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.
2.  Increased the weight in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
3.  Increased the weight in international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>.

By following these [[Investment strategies for stocks and bonds | investment strategies]] and understanding [[Investment strategies and asset allocation | asset allocation]], investors can build a resilient portfolio designed to withstand various economic climates.

Charlie Munger, the right-hand partner of Warren Buffett and a significant influence on thousands of investors worldwide, passed away recently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. This article compiles some of his key techniques and wisdom that helped him achieve success in his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a>. Munger's life, especially his early years, was fraught with complications, offering inspiration to many who might be starting from a more challenging situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.

## Charlie Munger's Challenging Path to Success

Charlie Munger's life began with significant adversity. At 29, he divorced, which left him in poverty and without a home to care for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. Tragically, at 31, his only son passed away from leukemia, a terrible disease at the time with a very low survival rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. Munger struggled to pay for his son's treatment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. Shortly after, he suffered a severe illness himself, leading to the loss of sight in one eye <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:22">[00:02:22]</a>.

Despite these immense personal and economic hardships, Munger decided to change his profession from law, which he disliked, to focus on real estate and stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. He founded investment partnerships that functioned like early investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. During 13 years, his partnerships generated an annualized return of 19% against the Dow Jones's 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>. After the 1974-75 crisis, experiencing significant losses and client pressure, Munger decided to close his fund and [[managing_an_investment_portfolio | only invest his own money]] from that point onward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>.

By 69, Munger had become one of the 400 richest people in the world, a testament to his resilience and [[longterm_investment_philosophy | long-term investment philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>. He served as the Vice President of Berkshire Hathaway and was Warren Buffett's partner and best friend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This story serves as an example that even successful individuals faced extremely complex pasts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

## Charlie Munger's Five Essential Investment Principles

Munger's [[investment_strategies_and_philosophies | investment strategies and philosophies]] are rooted in a combination of discipline, common sense, and a unique perspective on life. His success, he noted, was simply because they "did it for longer" and were "a little smarter than average," highlighting that [[investment_patience_and_compound_interest | investment is more important than intelligence]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.

### 1. Don't Postpone Your Dreams and Be Prepared for Opportunities
Munger's crucial advice was to "don't apply your dreams" or postpone things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. He believed there would never be an ideal moment to pursue aspirations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>. Using the metaphor of wanting to catch a 100 kg tuna but lacking the physical strength at an old age, he emphasized that one should "just go out there and start doing things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. This applies directly to investing, where people often fall into "paralysis by analysis," constantly seeking the perfect market conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Even Warren Buffett's mentor advised him not to start investing in 1957, a historically good time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

Instead of trying to "shoot at everything" in the stock market, Munger advocated for patience and caution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>. When a good opportunity arises, one should invest a "significant percentage of the portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>. His approach was to invest in a concentrated way in a few key holdings like Berkshire Hathaway, Costco, Daily Journal, and Li Lu's fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. He famously stated, "the money is not in the buying or selling, it is in the waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### 2. Have Low Expectations
Munger believed in setting "reasonable expectations" and accepting life's results, good and bad, with "a certain amount of stoicism" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:04">[00:21:04]</a>. He cautioned against setting "gigantic goals" in life, as they can lead to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. Instead, one should have enthusiasm, be grateful for what they have, and focus on continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>.

In investing, having low expectations helps reduce stress and fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:20">[00:23:20]</a>. The expectation of winning every year in the stock market is unrealistic and can lead to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:47">[00:23:47]</a>. By adopting a more humble approach, investors can avoid overconfidence and allow their [[longterm_investment_strategies | investments]] to surprise them over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">[00:23:06]</a>. This [[psychological_aspects_and_strategies_for_successful_investing | psychological aspect]] is crucial for maintaining a healthy relationship with investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:22">[00:24:22]</a>.

### 3. Accept Volatility
Munger famously stated, "if you cannot react calmly to a 50% drop in your portfolio two or three times throughout your life... not to be an investor in stocks" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. He added that if one cannot accept this, they "deserve to have mediocre results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:04">[00:25:04]</a>. The stock market does not move linearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Some of the best investments, like Amazon, collapsed by 98% before becoming exceptional <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:18">[00:25:18]</a>. Tesla also experienced multiple 50-70% drops before extraordinary revaluations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:28">[00:25:28]</a>.

Constantly trying to minimize losses or avoid volatility often leads to mediocre results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. If a good investment is made in a company with strong fundamentals and no significant changes, a dip can be a buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:58">[00:25:58]</a>. Historically, market falls are shorter than periods of economic prosperity and increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:12">[00:29:12]</a>. For instance, the average bull market lasts about 70 months with 200.7% realizations, while bear markets usually last 14 months with a 33% loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:52">[00:29:52]</a>.

### 4. Investment is Not Easy: Read and Gain Knowledge
Munger emphasized that investing "is not supposed to be easy, and whoever sees it as easy is stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. He observed that all successful people he met shared a common trait: they read a lot and possessed extensive knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. There are "no shortcuts in the stock market" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:36">[00:30:36]</a>. Investors must have a curiosity to understand how companies work, why some prosper, and others fail <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>.

Munger also stated that the best help one can give another human being is knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>. The greatest human satisfaction comes from self-realization, from achieving success through one's own efforts and knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.

### 5. Control Envy
Munger believed that the world is not moved by greed but by envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. While feeling envy might be normal, it must be controlled and transformed into motivation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:43">[00:33:43]</a>. Envy can lead to bad decisions in life and investments, such as chasing market fads because a neighbor is making money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:22">[00:34:22]</a>.

The average period of holding a stock in the market is now 4 months, compared to 8 years in the past, largely due to the constant flow of news and social media fueling envy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>. Historically, consistently investing in assets that are "not in fashion" has yielded significantly better results because their valuation is low, offering high potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:39:56">[00:39:56]</a>. This counter-intuitive approach requires discipline to resist the temptation of chasing popular sectors, as they often become overpriced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

## Practical Applications in Investing

Munger's [[investment_strategies and advice | investment strategies and advice]] translated into specific actions:

### Concentrated Investing
Munger's portfolio, notably through Daily Journal, was ultra-concentrated, often holding just two or three stocks like Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Alibaba (though he later called Alibaba a mistake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:49">[00:57:49]</a>. This high concentration reflected his belief in thoroughly understanding a few great businesses rather than diversifying broadly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:16">[00:58:16]</a>. His personal portfolio often included Costco, Berkshire Hathaway, and some real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:27">[00:58:27]</a>.

### Investing in "Compounders"
A significant portion (95%) of the wealth of Munger and Buffett came from about 20 good investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:35">[00:14:35]</a>. These "compounders" typically started as small or medium-cap companies with high growth potential, often operating in markets with large potential and possessing strong competitive advantages (e.g., unique products, scale advantages, switching costs, network effects) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a>.

*   **Costco**: Munger invested in Costco for over 25 years, buying it in the late 90s for $10 a share; it now lists at $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:46">[00:13:46]</a>. Its success demonstrates the power of [[investment_patience_and_compound_interest | compound interest]] and holding high-quality businesses for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway**: Munger invested when Berkshire Hathaway was worth $1 per share; today, each share is worth over $500,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. It's considered one of the best-performing global investments over the last 50-60 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   **Coca-Cola**: Buffett and Munger invested in Coca-Cola in the mid-80s when it was just over $60 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>. They view it as a "perfect business" due to its low investment requirements, high-profit margins, and a product that has remained essentially unchanged for 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:00">[00:50:00]</a>. Its ability to raise prices during inflation and its consistent dividend growth further exemplify its quality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:46">[00:48:46]</a>.
*   **Floor & Decor**: Munger identified Floor & Decor as the "new Costco," operating on a similar philosophy of "everyday low prices" and a direct-to-consumer model that cuts out intermediaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>. With a market capitalization 20 times smaller than Costco, it's in an earlier growth phase, demonstrating Munger's continued interest in high-growth small-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:10">[01:05:10]</a>.

### Investing Against Fads (Value Investing)
Munger consistently invested in sectors that were out of fashion. This allows for buying companies at lower valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:31">[00:40:31]</a>.

*   **Financial Sector**: Companies like Wells Fargo and Bank of America, main holdings of Daily Journal, benefited from rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:27">[01:00:27]</a>. This sector is often out of fashion, trading at much lower earnings multiples (e.g., 8-9 times) compared to the S&P 500 average (18 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:38">[01:00:38]</a>.
*   **Small Caps**: Currently, small-cap indices have fallen 30% from their maximums, presenting potential "compound futures" and lower valuations than historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:06">[02:07:06]</a>. Munger saw this as an exceptional time to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:54">[01:02:54]</a>.

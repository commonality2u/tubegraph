Global aid has reached record levels following the 2020 crisis, potentially leading to serious consequences for both the economy and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Prominent investors such as Warren Buffett and Ray Dalio have issued warnings regarding this risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. Understanding the dynamics of global debt and its impact on financial markets is crucial for investors and individuals alike <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>.

## Alarming Levels of Global Debt

Global aid has rapidly expanded, reaching alarming levels in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. According to the Institute of International Finance, the total global debt—comprising corporate debt, government debt, and individual or family debt—stands at $270 trillion, while the global gross domestic product (GDP) is only $80 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:04">[00:01:04]</a>. This equates to every inhabitant of Earth owing more than $35,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. The 2020 crisis has exacerbated this situation, pushing debt levels to new records <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

The International Monetary Fund (IMF) has stated that when a government's debt exceeds 77% of its GDP, it has severe repercussions for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. The worrying news is that most developed countries, including Spain, Europe, and the USA, have already surpassed this threshold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This record debt level exists amidst a period of historically low interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>. A critical question arises: what will happen when interest rates inevitably rise, forcing individuals, corporations, and governments to manage significant debt at a much higher cost? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>

### The Unprecedented Era of Negative Interest Rates

The last five years have seen an unusual economic phenomenon: negative interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>, a rare occurrence in 300 years of economic history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. Central banks have consistently lowered rates to combat crises; however, having reached zero, they can no longer be lowered <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. This "world upside down" scenario means people are effectively paying to lend money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. For instance, lending money to the German government via 10-year bonds with a negative yield of 0.6% per year ensures a loss, meaning a €100,000 loan would yield €94,000 after ten years, a loss of €6,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>.

Despite these guaranteed losses if held to maturity, the demand for these debt bonds (in both dollars and euros) is exceptionally high, with trillions flowing into the market daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This demand is driven by speculation: if the negative yield becomes even more negative due to market conditions or central bank actions, the bond's price on the stock market will rise, allowing for a profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. This is likened to playing "Russian roulette," where the long-term consequences are catastrophic, but short-term speculation can yield profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

The debt market is significantly larger than the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. In the US alone, the debt market's total value is approximately $40 trillion, double that of the stock market's $20 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:42">[00:03:42]</a>. Daily debt trading volume is around $700 million, while stock trading averages only $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. Consequently, developments in the debt market will have a major impact on stocks and the broader economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. Debt with negative interest rates globally reached a record $17 trillion in 2017 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.

Crises stemming from high debt levels are typically the most severe in the current economic system because credit is the "lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The 2008 financial crisis, heavily involving sub-prime mortgages, had serious economic consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>, unlike the milder 2000 tech bubble that did not involve significant debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.

### Ray Dalio's Warning and Market Impact

Ray Dalio, who manages the world's largest [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment fund]] and is known for anticipating macroeconomic events, has warned that the world will be "very different" in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>. He elaborated on the credit bubble, stating that reaching 0% interest rates means asset prices cannot be pushed further, and central banks' economic stimulus tools will become ineffective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a>. Dalio posits that the stock market and markets will have a greater effect on the economy than the economy itself on the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. If the debt market begins to fall, market participants controlling global credit will perceive problems, causing credit flow to cease, leading to economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Debt crises are usually triggered by an aggressive rise in interest rates, as seen in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>. Central banks have issued a large amount of new money to finance the 2020 crisis problems, which typically causes inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Inflation is the primary variable central banks consider when raising interest rates to balance the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a>. Therefore, future inflation, likely due to money printing, could trigger a fall in the debt market, making inflation monitoring critical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Strategies for Debt and Investments

### Managing Debt

For individuals with long-term debts, the ideal strategy is to secure a fixed interest rate to lock in today's low rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a>. If inflation appears, the value of assets like a home will rise, but the fixed-rate debt will remain constant, thus being a favorable financial operation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>. For short-term debts with high interest rates (e.g., credit cards at 25-30% annually), refinancing with personal loans at much lower rates (e.g., 8-12%) is advisable, especially in the current low-rate environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>.

### Protecting Investments

Regardless of one's investment status, saving is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>. When credit flow stops, liquidity becomes the most valuable asset, enabling [[investment_opportunities_in_volatile_market_conditions | investments]] at unprecedented prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:39">[00:07:39]</a>.

Here are key strategies to protect or benefit current [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]]:

*   **Avoid highly indebted companies:** If interest rates rise, such companies will struggle with increased costs and may face bankruptcy, especially if they are also cyclical businesses like banks, construction companies, or airlines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>. While some believe rising rates benefit banks, delinquency rates also increase, jeopardizing loan repayments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Warren Buffett has reduced his banking sector [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_a_bearish_market | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>. Tools like `marketskinner.com` (Finance section) can help assess a company's debt and cash levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:52">[00:12:52]</a>.
*   **Avoid [[avoiding_debt_in_investments | investing]] using debt:** When the cycle turns and opportunities emerge, credit will only be available to solvent investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:41">[00:08:41]</a>. This is when strategic debt can be used to capitalize on market opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Warren Buffett's Berkshire Hathaway has accumulated record liquidity, reaching $140 billion, demonstrating the value of cash reserves for future problems and [[investing_in_bear_markets | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:57">[00:08:57]</a>.
*   **Invest in companies with high liquidity, attractive valuation, and growth potential:** Companies that grow via acquisitions, like Berkshire Hathaway, are well-positioned during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>. Increased distressed companies, coupled with reduced competition due to tighter credit, allow liquid companies to make prime acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>. Buffett has consistently followed this pattern during past crises (2000, 2008) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>.

## Opportunities in Bonds and Debt Markets

### Investing Against Bonds or Debt (High Risk)

A fourth strategy involves [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_bonds | investing against bonds or debt]], though it carries high risk and demands significant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>. This is generally too complex for the average investor due to operation size and market opacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>.

However, inverse debt ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) have emerged to facilitate such operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>.
*   **US Debt Bond:** The LTE FE from Proshares (ticker: TVEFE) tracks the 20-year bond <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:01">[00:11:01]</a>. Its past performance has been poor, as high maintenance costs limit benefits if the debt market doesn't fall within a reasonable timeframe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:12">[00:11:12]</a>.
*   **European Debt Market:** The LT EFE from WS (ticker: XSV) is an option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:26">[00:11:26]</a>. Similarly, its performance during recent years has been unsatisfactory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:36">[00:11:36]</a>.

### Examples of [[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | Investment Opportunities]]

Here are three examples of companies that meet the aforementioned criteria for protection or benefit during a debt crisis, while also having promising realization potential even if adverse events do not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:45">[00:11:45]</a>.

#### 1. Cisco Systems (CSC)

Cisco Systems (US ticker: CSC) is a leading company in technological infrastructure products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:00">[00:12:00]</a>. Its sales are stable and crisis-resistant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>. Cisco possesses significant liquidity and is debt-free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:30">[00:12:30]</a>. It is projected to end 2021 with over $17 trillion in debt-free liquidity, which is valuable for acquisitions, business growth, or share buybacks during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:00">[00:13:00]</a>.

As a mature company with limited growth potential, Cisco's earnings per share (EPS) might increase from around $3 (2021 estimate) to $4 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:21">[00:13:21]</a>. Valuing this at a P/E of 15 suggests a target price of $60 per share, offering limited upside from its current $44 but providing a crisis-resistant company with substantial liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:43">[00:13:43]</a>.

#### 2. Constellation Software (CS)

Constellation Software (Canadian ticker: CS) is a top technology stock, having multiplied by over 80 times on the stock market in the last 12 years, yielding an average annual return of over 25% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>. It possesses three key characteristics for adapting to a future debt crisis:
1.  Large liquidity on its balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.
2.  Growth through acquisitions, which will be more abundant and at better prices during a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:11">[00:15:11]</a>.
3.  A highly resilient business model that ensures acquired businesses perform well during economic difficulties <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

During the worst years of the 2008 crisis (2006-2011), its income grew from $200 million to over $700 million, with spectacular growth rates in 2008, 2009, and 2010 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:38">[00:15:38]</a>. Gross profit also doubled in those years, from $120 million to over $260 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

While its future growth rate is projected to be lower than in the past, it could still average 15% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:29">[00:16:29]</a>. This implies a target price of $3,000 per share from its current $1,600, offering an average annual return of 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:36">[00:16:36]</a>. This makes it a very safe and stable company with additional upside potential if a debt crisis occurs, as demonstrated in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:52">[00:16:52]</a>.

#### 3. Oracle (ORCL)

Oracle (US ticker: ORCL) is another top technology company, with its shares multiplying over 100 times in the last 30 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:33">[00:17:33]</a>. It provides crucial business management software, ensuring predictable income, high profit margins, and a high return on equity, hallmarks of good companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:46">[00:17:46]</a>. Oracle's performance during economic crises, like in 2008, was excellent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:58">[00:17:58]</a>. It is among American companies with the highest liquidity on their balance sheets, alongside Apple, Berkshire Hathaway, and Google <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:04">[00:18:04]</a>.

As a mature company, Oracle's EPS could rise to nearly $5 in three to five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>. Valuing it at its historical average P/E of around 20 times suggests a target price of $100 per share, an interesting realization potential from its current $60 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Like Cisco Systems, Oracle is a predictable, highly liquid, and crisis-resistant company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

Investing for the long term involves understanding market dynamics, identifying undervalued companies, and adopting a disciplined approach. This article explores strategies and specific company examples based on the practices of successful investors and market trends.

## Core Investment Principles

A foundational approach to investing involves learning from investors with strong historical results, as their chosen stocks have typically undergone rigorous vetting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. However, it is crucial to remain responsible for one's own analysis, supervision, and monitoring of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

### Advantages of Private Investors

Private investors possess an inherent advantage: they can achieve better results than professionals, sometimes even with less specialized knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. This is because managing large amounts of capital can be a significant handicap for major funds, often preventing them from investing in smaller, lesser-known companies that offer superior returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>. Private investors, on the other hand, can freely explore and invest in these smaller, high-potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Transparency and Education

Any investment advice should be accompanied by full transparency, especially if the advisor holds shares in the discussed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Education is paramount, and it is advisable to learn from professionals with audited track records and relevant licenses, rather than those who lack proven investment results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.

## Identifying Investment Opportunities

A common strategy for generating [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment ideas]] is to observe what successful investors are currently buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

### Key Resources:

*   **Wayback Wisdom**: This resource can be used to track popular shares and movements of influential funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">[00:40:47]</a>.

## Popular and Promising Stocks for Long-Term Growth

### Large-Cap Companies

#### Visa and Mastercard
Both Visa and Mastercard are considered "very good companies" with "great competitive advantages" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. They offer a potential annual return of 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

#### Marsh & McLennan (MMC)

The financial sector, including Wells Fargo, remains relatively cheap, trading below its historical average despite recent gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Key metrics for valuing banks like Wells Fargo include net income, book value, and tangible book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:09">[00:07:09]</a>. Wells Fargo has a return on tangible book value (RTC) of 12%, suggesting it should trade at two times its book value, but is currently trading at 1.1 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>. The company is also benefiting from share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:21">[01:01:21]</a>.

The pandemic accelerated its customer adoption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:37">[00:12:37]</a>.

Based on free cash flow, it trades at less than 20 times earnings, which is undervalued given its quality and growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>.

Microsoft consistently grows sales by over 10% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:40">[02:24:40]</a>, expands margins, and returns capital to shareholders through share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:02">[02:26:02]</a>. It is a solid company, crisis-resistant, debt-free, and has almost no competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:06">[02:26:06]</a>. Expected annual returns are 15-25% to 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:25:59">[02:25:59]</a>.

The company's various business lines are experiencing significant growth (e.g., 126% per year in one division) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:50">[00:59:50]</a>.

Lockheed Martin, a defense contractor, manufactures unique, irreplaceable products like the F-35 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:16">[02:29:16]</a>.

The company has no competition, possesses high technology, and is not affected by crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:48">[02:29:48]</a>.

## Varying Investment Styles and Approaches

### Macroeconomic Investment
Ray Dalio, head of Bridgewater, the world's largest investment fund, employs a macroeconomic [[investment_philosophy_and_longterm_planning | investment philosophy]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>. His recent moves, such as selling gold and emerging market assets while buying consumer staples (Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, Walmart), suggest a belief that inflation will stabilize or decrease <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:50">[02:47:50]</a>. Consumer staple stocks tend to perform well when there is no inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:42">[02:48:42]</a>.

### Traditional Value and Growth
Turtle Creek, a Canadian fund, focuses on traditional value companies that are cheap and exhibit certain growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:43">[02:49:43]</a>. Their strategy has yielded spectacular results, turning $1 into $65 over 20 years, an average annual return of 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

### Hyper-Growth Stocks
High-growth stocks, such as Palantir or those in electric car batteries, are characterized by rapid revenue increases but often have negative profit margins as they heavily reinvest in marketing and sales to gain market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:48">[02:41:48]</a>. Valuation in these cases is less precise and more volatile, often relying on future EBITDA margins and high multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:02">[02:44:02]</a>. While they offer high potential, the margin of safety is lower compared to value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:21">[02:45:21]</a>.

## Avoiding Pitfalls
Investors should be wary of exaggerated claims, such as bots that generate "free money" in the stock market or pyramid schemes offering guaranteed high interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:13">[02:07:13]</a>. These are often scams designed to exploit investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:26">[02:07:26]</a>.

It is important to understand that the automobile business is generally considered a "bad business" due to its cyclical nature, capital intensity, high competition, and low profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:05">[01:38:05]</a>. While companies like Ford have recovered due to temporary high demand post-lockdown, their long-term growth remains limited <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:18">[01:39:18]</a>. Avoid paying more than 10-15 times sales for most companies, as valuations beyond this range are highly speculative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:11">[01:12:11]</a>.

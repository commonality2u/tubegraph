Charlie Munger, Warren Buffett's long-time partner and an influential figure for thousands of investors worldwide, passed away at 99 years old <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. His life, especially his early years, was complicated, serving as an inspiration due to his journey from adversity to immense success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>. Munger's wisdom and techniques helped him become a millionaire and achieve success in his investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Early Life and Overcoming Hardships

Munger's early life was marked by significant challenges:
*   **Divorce and Poverty** At 29, he divorced his first wife, which left him in poverty, without a home, and struggling to care for his children <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>.
*   **Son's Illness and Death** At 31, his only son suffered from leukemia. At that time, the disease had a very low success rate for treatment, and Munger literally had no money to pay for his son's medical care; his son eventually passed away <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. A partner from Berkshire Hathaway commented on how difficult this period was, with Munger often leaving the hospital in tears <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.
*   **Personal Health Crisis** Shortly after his son's death, Munger himself suffered a very serious illness that caused terrible pain and led to him losing sight in one of his eyes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>.

Despite being economically and emotionally ruined, Munger decided to study law but realized it wasn't for him <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>. He then shifted his focus to real estate investments and, more significantly, the stock market, where he founded his famous partnerships, which functioned like early investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>.

## Investment Career and Partnership with Warren Buffett

During his 13 years managing external money, Munger's partnerships generated about $4 million (equivalent to $20 million today, adjusted for inflation) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:15">[00:03:15]</a>. He achieved an annualized return of 19% against the Dow Jones's 5% during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:03">[00:05:03]</a>.

However, the 1974-75 crisis brought significant losses, leading to immense pressure from clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Once his fund recovered slightly, he decided to close it, return all the money, and from that point onward, he committed to investing only his own capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

His main investment became [[History and investment style of Michael Burry | Berkshire Hathaway]], where he served as vice president and became the best friend and partner of [[Investment advice and strategies from top investors | Warren Buffett]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. At 69, after enduring numerous hardships, Munger became one of the 400 richest people globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

## Key Investment Philosophies

Charlie Munger's [[Investment philosophy and longterm planning | investment philosophy]] can be summarized through several core pieces of advice:

### 1. Don't Postpone Your Dreams: Just Start Doing Things
Munger emphasized that "some of the things in life cannot be postponed" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. He regretted not catching a 100 kg tuna when he was younger, as it required a strong physique he no longer possessed at 95 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:18">[00:06:18]</a>. This metaphor translates to investing: don't wait for ideal conditions or perfect timing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:30">[00:06:30]</a>. Many investors suffer from "paralysis by analysis," constantly seeking the perfect situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Even in 1957, a historic time to invest, [[Investment advice and strategies from top investors | Warren Buffett]] was advised against launching an investment fund due to perceived poor economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. Munger's advice is to "just go out there and start doing things" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### 2. Have Low Expectations
Munger believed that having gigantic, aspirational goals can lead to frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. He and [[Investment advice and strategies from top investors | Warren Buffett]] never imagined having $100 million when they started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:11">[00:08:11]</a>. Instead, focus on enthusiasm, gratitude, covering basic needs, and continuous learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:20">[00:22:20]</a>. This approach allows life and investments to "surprise you" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:34">[00:22:34]</a>. Unrealistic expectations, like wanting to win every year in the stock market, are a common cause of frustration <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.

### 3. Accept Volatility
Munger famously stated, "If you cannot react calmly to a 50% drop in your portfolio two or three times throughout your life... you deserve to have mediocre results" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:48">[00:24:48]</a>. The stock market does not move linearly, and even the best investments, like Amazon, have seen collapses (e.g., 98% before becoming exceptional) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>. Constantly trying to minimize losses or avoid volatility leads to mediocre returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:48">[00:25:48]</a>. Market falls, particularly in small caps, often precede periods of strong returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:34">[00:26:34]</a>.

### 4. Investment Isn't Easy: Embrace Knowledge
Munger declared, "This investment thing is not supposed to be easy, and whoever sees it as easy is stupid" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:12">[00:30:12]</a>. He observed that all successful people read a lot and possess extensive knowledge, implying there are no shortcuts in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>. Enjoying the process of understanding how companies work and why some prosper is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:08">[00:31:08]</a>. For Munger, the best gift you can give another human being is knowledge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:32">[00:31:32]</a>.

### 5. Control Envy
Munger asserted, "The world is not moved by greed but it moves because of envy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:14">[00:33:14]</a>. Envy can lead to unpleasant feelings and poor investment decisions, such as chasing fads or bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:30">[00:33:30]</a>. When a neighbor makes money from a "bubble" stock, envy can lead an investor to sell their stable stock and buy into the trendy one, leading to bad decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:24">[00:34:24]</a>. This behavior contributes to the short-term nature of the market today, where the average holding period for a stock is only four months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:49">[00:34:49]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Specific Examples

[[Charlie Manger's investment strategies | Charlie Munger's investment strategy]] emphasized patience, concentration, and long-term holding:
*   **Patience and Concentration** Munger advised being "very patient" and "very cautious," only investing a significant percentage of the portfolio when a truly good opportunity arises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>. He believed in investing in a concentrated way, typically in just 10 things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>.
*   **"Money is in the Waiting"** As he often said, "the money is not in the buying or selling, it is in the waiting" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. This highlights the power of compound interest for stocks that grow profits consistently over many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:14">[00:13:14]</a>.
*   **Focus on Small Companies with Growth Potential** Munger and Buffett's wealth largely came from about 20 good investments that were often small-cap companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:40">[00:14:40]</a>. For a stock to multiply by 30-100 times, it needs to grow consistently above 15% for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:12">[00:15:12]</a>. Such companies operate in large potential markets, have a small market share initially, possess a competitive advantage (like a unique product, scale, switching costs, or network effect), and have an aligned board of directors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:21">[00:15:21]</a>.

### Featured Investments

Munger frequently discussed certain companies that exemplified his investment philosophy:

#### 1. Costco
Munger had been invested in Costco for over 25 years, buying shares in the late 1990s when they were around $10; today, they list at $600 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. He considered it a long-term investment for predictable returns higher than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:32">[01:04:32]</a>.

#### 2. Coca-Cola
Often described by Munger and Buffett as "the perfect business" or "prototype of a business," Coca-Cola was first invested in by [[Investment advice and strategies from top investors | Warren Buffett]] and Munger in the mid-1980s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:40">[00:47:40]</a>.
*   **Key Characteristics**: It requires minimal investment, leading to high-profit margins and protection during inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:03">[00:50:03]</a>. The product has remained essentially the same for 100 years, requiring very little research and development compared to industries like automotive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:23">[00:50:23]</a>. It has a high return on invested capital, allowing for reinvestment into growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:37">[00:52:37]</a>. Coca-Cola also intelligently diversified into other categories, like light and zero sugar versions, energy drinks, and coffee (Costa Coffee) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:55">[00:48:55]</a>.
*   **Growth and Dividends**: While not expected to multiply 30-100 times like early-stage compounders, Coca-Cola continues to grow, adapting well to different economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:00">[00:55:00]</a>. Its impressive dividend payout has multiplied four to five times over the last two decades, with shares appreciating similarly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:13">[00:56:13]</a>.

#### 3. Daily Journal
This company, originally a newspaper business, was transformed by Munger <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:36">[00:57:36]</a>. He wisely reinvested the cash flow from the newspapers into stock investments, creating a personal, ultra-concentrated portfolio (his primary holdings were Wells Fargo, Bank of America, and Alibaba, though he later admitted Alibaba was a mistake) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>. The Daily Journal now primarily focuses on software and databases for the legal and public administration systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:45">[00:58:45]</a>. Munger saw opportunities in sectors that were out of fashion, like the financial sector, which traded at much lower valuations than historical averages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:36">[01:00:36]</a>.

#### 4. Floor & Decor (The "New Costco")
Munger identified Floor & Decor as having much in common with Costco but at an earlier stage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:05:46">[01:05:46]</a>.
*   **Business Model**: It's a retailer specializing in floors and decoration materials, known for its "everyday low prices" philosophy, similar to Mercadona in Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>. Floor & Decor realized the traditional sector structure involved too many intermediaries; it bypassed agents, importers, and distributors by contacting manufacturers directly and handling the entire import, distribution, and retail process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:10">[01:07:10]</a>.
*   **Competitive Advantage**: Its large, efficient warehouse-style stores (typically 8,000 m²) offer a visually appealing shopping experience, allowing customers to see the finished look of products, which is crucial for flooring <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:44">[01:07:44]</a>. This model has allowed it to prosper despite the rise of the internet, as many customers are professionals who value in-person advice and immediate pick-up <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:25">[01:09:25]</a>.
*   **Growth and Potential**: Floor & Decor has aggressively expanded, opening stores at an 18% annual growth rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:27">[01:10:27]</a>. Its profit margins are expanding, leading to a "beastly" 37% annual growth in benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:45">[01:10:45]</a>. The company estimates a potential market of $50 billion in the U.S., with its current market share being only about 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:54">[01:12:54]</a>. The payback period for new stores is incredibly fast, averaging around 3 years, with a high return on investment of nearly 25% per store <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Conclusion

Charlie Munger's [[Charlie Mungers economic crisis warning | life story]] and [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and advice for stock market success | investment advice]] offer enduring lessons: start early, embrace discipline, understand compounding, and focus on understandable businesses with strong competitive advantages, even if they are out of fashion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. His emphasis on patience, emotional control (especially envy), and continuous learning remains highly relevant for aspiring investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:00">[00:32:00]</a>. His final advice: "Don't put things off, don't try to catch that 100kg tuna when you are 95 years old, start by doing things today" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:18">[01:32:18]</a>.

When the economy is weak or facing difficulties, certain businesses demonstrate remarkable resilience, often performing better than the overall market. These [[predictable_and_resilient_businesses | crisis-resistant businesses]] are characterized by stable consumption and low debt, making them valuable components of an investment portfolio during periods of economic uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:08">[00:01:08]</a>. They tend to drop less during market downturns, provide liquidity, and can serve as a buffer for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:56">[02:09:56]</a>.

## Characteristics of Crisis-Resistant Businesses

[[Identifying good businesses and competitive advantages | Quality companies]] with recurring income and low debt are considered a winning formula for [[investment_strategies_during_a_financial_crisis | investment strategies during a financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:50">[02:09:50]</a>. During a stock market crisis, these companies tend to experience smaller declines compared to the broader market or other stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:58">[02:09:58]</a>. This allows investors to sell them, create liquidity, and capitalize on opportunities in deeply fallen stocks for greater future profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:13">[02:11:13]</a>.

The [[sectors_resilient_in_economic_recessions | sectors resilient in economic recessions]] often include:
*   **Stable Consumption**: Businesses providing basic needs and regular human consumption, such as food, drinks, and clothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:15:09">[02:15:09]</a>.
*   **Utilities**: Companies providing essential services like water and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:07">[02:27:07]</a>.
*   **Healthcare**: The healthcare sector is generally not as affected by economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:40">[02:40:40]</a>.

These businesses are attractive to investors because their low volatility helps reduce the likelihood of making bad decisions, such as selling at the worst time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:39">[02:59:39]</a>.

## Case Study: Ahold Delhaize (Supermarket Chain)

Ahold Delhaize is a supermarket company primarily listed in Europe, though the majority of its business is in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:49:58">[03:49:58]</a>. It has a long history of 150 years, having withstood two world wars, multiple crises, and periods of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:37">[03:57:37]</a>. The company has a turnover of almost 100 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:58:30">[03:58:30]</a>.

### Performance During Crises
During the 2008 Great Financial Crisis, when the stock market fell by 60%, Ahold Delhaize's stock remained largely sideways, with only minor declines, demonstrating its resilience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:15">[03:17:15]</a>. In the period between 2007 and 2011, which included the European crisis, its profits grew from 0.70 to 1 euro per share, indicating continued growth even during difficult times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:33:57">[03:33:57]</a>. Its profits are described as "very, very predictable" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:01">[03:59:01]</a>.

### Competitive Advantages
Ahold Delhaize holds a leading market position (number one or two) in most markets where it competes, especially on the East Coast of the United States in food supermarkets, surpassing even giants like Costco or Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:17:17">[03:17:17]</a>. Its scale is crucial in the supermarket sector, which operates on very low profit margins (3-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:45">[03:46:45]</a>. This scale provides significant negotiating power with suppliers, allowing for discounts that smaller competitors cannot access <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:56:59">[03:56:59]</a>.

The company also benefits from its own private label products, which make up 45% of its sales, contributing to higher profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:09:40">[04:09:40]</a>. It has a proven online sales model, with 14% of sales coming from this channel <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:13:13">[04:13:13]</a>.

### Financial Outlook
Ahold Delhaize's three-year business plan aims for 4% sales growth and high single-digit earnings per share growth, partly driven by share buybacks (1 trillion annually, or 3%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:08:51">[04:08:51]</a>. Its current dividend yield is 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:07">[04:27:07]</a>, and it trades at about 12 times earnings, making it appear undervalued compared to peers like Walmart, which trades at 38 times earnings despite slower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:25:27">[04:25:27]</a>.

## Case Study: British American Tobacco (Tobacco Sector)

British American Tobacco (BAT) is another example of a [[predictable_and_resilient_businesses | stable consumption]] company, operating in a sector where people consume products regularly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:32:04">[04:32:04]</a>.

### Performance During Crises
During the massive global stock market crisis from February 2008 to April 2009, when the overall market dropped 60%, BAT's stock only fell by 13% (or 10% including dividends), a "nearly anecdotal" decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:59:58">[04:59:58]</a>. The company maintained or even increased its profits during this difficult period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:04">[05:32:04]</a>. Its earnings per share continued to rise from 1 to 1.50 during the 2007-2009 crisis period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>.

### Business Evolution and Growth Drivers
While the volume of traditional cigarette consumption has decreased (6% from 2017-2024), companies like BAT have been able to raise prices due to a "captive customer" base, resulting in overall lateral growth of about 1% annually for this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:10:47">[05:10:47]</a>.

New categories, such as vaping and oral tobacco (e.g., Velo), are growing significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:24:00">[05:24:00]</a>. These categories are considered less harmful, leading to lower taxes from governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:39">[05:58:39]</a> and allowing for advertising campaigns, unlike traditional tobacco products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:59:28">[05:59:28]</a>. Vaping and oral tobacco are projected to grow by 20% annually until 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:07:07">[05:07:07]</a>. These new categories, while initially causing losses due to heavy investment and advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:47:42">[05:47:42]</a>, reached breakeven in 2023 and are expected to skyrocket in profitability, potentially adding billions to the company's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:56:05">[05:56:05]</a>.

### Hidden Asset: ITC Limited
BAT holds a 20% ownership stake in ITC Limited, one of India's main consumer companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:04">[01:01:04]</a>. India is experiencing high growth in consumer products, and ITC trades at high multiples (25-30 times earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:07">[01:19:07]</a> due to its growth in the Indian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:16">[01:03:16]</a>. This stake is valued at approximately 15 billion dollars, significantly impacting BAT's overall valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:35">[01:03:35]</a>. BAT recently reduced its stake from 29% to 25%, generating cash to strengthen its balance sheet, reduce debt, and implement share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:04:36">[01:04:36]</a>.

### Financial Metrics
BAT currently offers a high dividend yield of 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:08">[00:57:08]</a> and trades at historical lows, around eight times earnings, despite a historical average of 16-25 times earnings for similar stable consumer stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:56">[00:59:56]</a>. When adjusted for its stake in ITC, the valuation becomes even lower, around 6.5 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:41">[01:02:41]</a>.

## Investing in Volatile Environments

[[Investment strategies for economic crises | Investment strategies for economic crises]] emphasize that investors should not have debt when investing, especially when markets are at their highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:46">[01:32:46]</a>. It is beneficial to maintain some liquidity and debt capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:23">[01:53:23]</a>. When assets have fallen and are cheap, it becomes less risky to acquire them, and the potential for increased returns is greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>.

A key strategy is to rotate the portfolio and take advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:59">[01:19:59]</a>. The greatest profits in the stock market are often made during times of panic and fear when businesses are quoted at "ridiculous prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:06">[01:36:06]</a>. This herd behavior on the stock market, where fear drives further sales, creates opportunities for those who are prepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>.

Another strategy is to hold long-term bonds, like the 20-year long-term bond ETF (TLT), which can act as a hedge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:10">[02:29:10]</a>. If there's no recession, these bonds maintain their value and yield returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:07">[02:31:07]</a>. However, if a recession occurs, the Federal Reserve typically lowers rates, causing the value of long-term bonds to increase, as they move inversely to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:08">[02:43:08]</a>. This strategy is considered smarter than directly shorting the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:51">[02:48:51]</a>.

Ultimately, all crises typically pass within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:52:50">[02:52:50]</a>. The best approach is to buy when fear and panic are high, as this is when the most money can be made for those who are prepared with knowledge and training <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:33">[02:53:33]</a>. [[Preparing for Stock Market Crises | Preparing for Stock Market Crises]] involves understanding economic data, such as the yield curve, and strategically rotating portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:16">[03:31:16]</a>.

While attention is often focused on the current [[impact_of_tariffs_on_the_global_economy | tariff crisis]], a more severe situation with significant [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | economic consequences]] may be emerging <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>.

## Expert Warnings
Renowned economist and investor Ray Dalio has indicated that the new world order is shifting, and the [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | global economy]] faces major, difficult-to-solve challenges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. According to Dalio, we are entering a serious [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | economic]] and [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | debt crisis]] that will be exacerbated by the ongoing [[impact_of_tariffs_on_the_global_economy | tariff crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:18">[00:00:18]</a>. He describes this impending crisis as a "once in a lifetime" event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

Other prominent economic leaders, including Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Jamie Dimon, have also publicly warned about this issue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.

Dalio, known for his ability to anticipate and predict [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | economic crises]], managed Bridgewater, the world's largest investment fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. His excellent results during the 2000 and 2008 economic crises underscore his foresight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:56">[00:01:56]</a>. In a recent CNBC interview, Dalio stressed that current events, such as the [[impact_of_tariffs_on_the_global_economy | tariff crisis]], should not divert attention from the larger picture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He stated that without necessary measures, both the United States and Europe are rapidly heading into recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:20">[00:02:20]</a>.

> "We are witnessing the classic collapse of the major economic, political, and geopolitical powers. This kind of collapse only happens once in a lifetime." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:32">[00:02:32]</a>

## Economic Indicators and Recession Risk
The state of the economy can be verified through economic indicators <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. A country is generally considered to be entering recession if it experiences two consecutive quarters of decline in Gross Domestic Product (GDP) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>. The Federal Reserve's real-time data on economic activity shows a negative figure for expected economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:07">[00:03:07]</a>. If this economic trend continues over the next 90 days, further worsened by the [[impact_of_tariffs_on_the_global_economy | current tariff situation]], it would officially lead to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. Historically, U.S. recessions have affected the rest of the world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.

## Business Uncertainty and Layoffs
The current period is marked by [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | extreme uncertainty]], causing companies to prepare for a possible recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>. Uncertainty is detrimental to capitalism, halting investment, increasing layoffs, and causing banks to cease lending <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Companies are hesitant to make long-term investments without clear visibility on taxes or economic returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:10">[00:04:10]</a>.

Ed Bastian, CEO of Delta Airlines, noted the "self-inflicted crisis" and stated that Delta is operating as if a recession is already underway, unable to project future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>. This caution is widespread, with many companies announcing layoffs and workforce reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. Bloomberg charts show that layoff announcements have surged to levels seen in previous crises (e.g., 2000, 2008, 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. Economic uncertainty has also surpassed levels of other crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

A KPMG study of top executives revealed that 86% anticipate a recession as the most probable economic scenario for 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>.

## US-China Conflict and its Economic Dimension
Ray Dalio highlights the unresolved conflict between the United States and China as a significant problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>. He points out a critical imbalance: the U.S. relies on imports from China, while China depends on capital from the U.S. and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. Dalio argues that it is difficult for the U.S. or Europe to achieve true independence from China, partly due to long-term planning differences (China plans 30 years ahead, the West plans for the next election) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:36">[00:07:36]</a>. This shift in global competition underpins Dalio's concept of a [[impact_of_new_risks_on_the_economy_and_stock_market | new world order]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:59">[00:07:59]</a>.

Furthermore, Dalio warned that the United States must drastically reduce its fiscal deficit, or the dollar will continue to lose value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:05">[00:08:05]</a>. The dollar has indeed seen a dramatic loss of over 7% of its value in a few days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:16">[00:08:16]</a>.

## Impact on [[impact_on_global_financial_markets | Financial Markets]] and Investment Strategies
Dalio has warned of a potential major [[current_global_debt_crisis_and_its_impact_on_the_economy | debt crisis]] in the next three years and recommends investors adapt their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Bonds
Traditionally, cash or bonds were considered safe havens in portfolios, acting as a cushion during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. However, the current crisis has been different, as bonds have fallen in value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>. This is partly because China has begun selling U.S. and European sovereign bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>, a significant issue given China is the largest investor in American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>. China has reduced its U.S. debt holdings by over $400 billion in recent years, with recent reports indicating sales of over $50 billion due to rising tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:53">[00:10:53]</a>. Central banks are hesitant to intervene and buy up debt, as it could further increase inflation, which is already high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a>.

### Gold
Dalio consistently advises investors to hold between 10% and 15% of their portfolio in gold-related investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:33">[00:11:33]</a>. He considers gold the purest form of money, uncontrollable by governments and not subject to devaluation by printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. Increasing geopolitical tensions are driving demand for gold, pushing its value higher (over $3,100 per ounce) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:25">[00:12:25]</a>. Gold has provided real protection, appreciating by 79% during this period, while U.S. long-term bonds lost 48% of their value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>.

Massive gold imports into the United States significantly impact economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:54">[00:12:54]</a>. This is because other central banks are buying large amounts of gold to protect themselves from the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:58">[00:12:58]</a>. They trust the U.S. to guard this gold, considering it the safest storage location <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:07">[00:13:07]</a>.

### Stocks
Stocks remain the most important part of an investor's portfolio for long-term returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. Dalio's primary advice for stock investing is diversification:
*   Diversify across six different economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:56">[00:13:56]</a>.
*   Prioritize sectors like healthcare, technology, and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
*   Hold at least 10-20 different stocks for diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.
*   Focus on quality, well-managed companies with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

His own portfolio reflects these principles, showing increased positions in technology companies (Microsoft, Google, Facebook, Tesla) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:37">[00:14:37]</a>, defensive consumer companies (Pepsi, Coca-Cola, McDonald's) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>, and resilient healthcare firms (Pfizer, Merck, Johnson & Johnson, CIGNA) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:07">[00:15:07]</a>.

> [!TIP] Sectors most affected by recession include real estate, technology, financial, and discretionary consumption (e.g., automobiles, airlines) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. The best sectors for this environment are healthcare, energy, and utility companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:49">[00:15:49]</a>. Dalio's strategy largely aligns with these resilient sectors, which are also insulated from the [[impact_of_tariffs_on_the_global_economy | current tariff crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:58">[00:15:58]</a>.

## Conclusion
Most [[impacts_of_global_crises_on_the_economy | economic crises]] typically last 18 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This period presents an opportunity to invest in large companies at attractive valuations, which can lead to better long-term performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Viewing the situation as a long-term opportunity and focusing on increasing knowledge are crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Noted investor Michael Burry, known for his prominent role in *The Big Short*, has issued his latest warning regarding the stock market, stating that the crisis has "only just begun" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. He has gone as far as to predict a specific level the stock market could reach before the crisis potentially ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>.

## Historical Context and Predictions

[[Michael Burrys investment style and achievements | Michael Burry]] gained fame for accurately predicting the dot-com bubble crisis, noting its similarities to the current market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:29">[01:38:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He also successfully predicted and profited from the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:47:00">[01:47:00]</a>. Even the market downturn during the 2020 virus confinement was anticipated by Burry, who knew when to buy into undervalued shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>. For the past five years, managing only his own money, he has generated returns exceeding 20% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>.

## Current Market Warnings

Burry recently reactivated his Twitter account, which had previously been suspended due to concerns about market manipulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:00">[02:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:00">[02:30:00]</a>. In the past year, he warned of impending inflation, rising interest rates, and bubbles in high-growth stocks, cloud stocks, renewable energy, and cryptocurrenciesâ€”predictions that have largely materialized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.

He asserts that the current market situation is a typical "bear market" characterized by numerous "bear market rallies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:12:00">[03:12:00]</a>. A bear market rally occurs when the stock market temporarily rebounds during a downtrend before continuing its decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:21:00">[03:21:00]</a>. Many investors mistakenly buy during these rebounds, believing the crisis is over, only to face further losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>. The V-shaped recovery of 2020 was atypical, leading to a false sense of security where "buying the dip" always seemed to work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:53:00">[03:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. However, in major crises like those in 2000 and 1929, there were numerous false recovery attempts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:00">[04:21:00]</a>.

### Predicted Market Bottom

In a recent tweet in May, [[Michael Burrys market analysis and warnings | Michael Burry]] utilized technical analysis and valuation ratios to project the market's bottom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:00">[07:39:00]</a>. He calculates that bear markets typically end 13% to 17% below the minimum of the previous crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:13:00">[08:13:00]</a>.

He estimates that the S&P 500 could bottom out at a Price-to-Earnings (PER) ratio of 9 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. This PER 9 valuation aligns with the S&P 500's bottom in 2009 and would coincide with a 15% drop below the 2020 virus minimum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:45:00">[08:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:50:00">[08:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. This translates to the S&P 500 reaching approximately 1,860 points, which would represent an additional 50% drop from current levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:06:00">[09:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:12:00">[09:12:00]</a>.

This prediction is primarily based on the PER ratio, considering that average S&P 500 earnings are currently around $200 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:25:00">[09:25:00]</a>. If earnings were to fall to $170-$160 during a recession and then applied to a PER of 9, it would yield a target around $1,800 for the S&P 500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:37:00">[09:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:48:00">[09:48:00]</a>.

## Reasons for the Downturn

*   **Bear Market Rallies**: The current market is prone to deceptive rebounds, where investors buy thinking the crisis is over, only for the market to fall further <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:00">[03:39:00]</a>.
*   **Central Bank Policy**: The Federal Reserve (Fed) is actively tightening economic conditions, potentially leading to a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:00">[06:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:06:00">[06:06:00]</a>. They intend to continue raising rates to combat inflation, possibly even welcoming a recession to cool things down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:58:00">[12:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:00">[13:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:00">[13:08:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation Distortion**: The market has reached "obscene levels" of capitalization, particularly in high-growth, unprofitable companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. This includes non-stock market assets like cryptocurrencies, which have reached valuations comparable to past bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:34:00">[14:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:41:00">[14:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:51:00">[14:51:00]</a>.
*   **Capital Outflows**: A significant sign of a market bottom is sustained capital outflows, which are only just starting to occur, indicating the market may still have further to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:28:00">[24:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="24:53:00">[24:53:00]</a>.
*   **Bond Yields as Gravity**: The 10-year US Treasury bond acts as a "force of gravity" on stock valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="29:29:00">[29:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a>. As bond yields rise (e.g., from 1% to 3%), they make stocks less attractive, especially those with high valuations or no profits, pulling stock valuations down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:08:00">[30:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:17:00">[30:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:51:00">[30:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:59:00">[30:59:00]</a>.

## [[Michael Burrys investment strategies and portfolio changes | Portfolio Adjustments]]

In response to this scenario, [[Michael Burrys current investment portfolio | Michael Burry]] has been making significant adjustments to his portfolio. He has dismantled many positions, greatly increasing his liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:11:00">[17:11:00]</a>. His portfolio value declared to the SEC dropped significantly from $300 million in Q3 2020 to only $75 million currently invested in long shares, suggesting a large cash position or short bets not required to be reported <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a>.

He has concentrated his remaining investments in very defensive stocks, with his top three holdings making up almost 75% of his limited portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:47:00">[17:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:50:00">[17:50:00]</a>.

### [[Overview of Michael Burrys significant stock picks | Notable Stock Picks]]

*   **Bristol Myers (BMY)**: His largest holding, also invested in by Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:49:00">[17:49:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:32:00">[42:32:00]</a>. This pharmaceutical company is highly crisis-resistant, less affected by inflation, and benefits from consistent demand for healthcare products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:53:00">[42:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="42:57:00">[42:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:02:00">[43:02:00]</a>. It has a strong shareholder return program, including increasing dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:19:00">[43:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:23:00">[43:23:00]</a>. It trades below its historical valuation average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:27:00">[43:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:30:00">[43:30:00]</a>.
*   **General Dynamics (GD)**: A defense company with strong performance, trading above its historical average valuation, likely due to market perceptions of security amidst global conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:07:00">[48:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:19:00">[48:19:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:22:00">[48:22:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:47:00">[50:47:00]</a>. The company operates in aerospace, maritime defense, combat systems, and technology segments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:36:00">[48:36:00]</a>. It has a high competitive advantage due to specialized products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:43:00">[53:43:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="53:46:00">[53:46:00]</a>.

## Broader Market Perspective and Investment Philosophy

Other notable investors share concerns. George Soros believes that most money is lost not by those who bought at the peak of a bubble, but by those who buy repeatedly as the market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:21:00">[06:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:22:00">[07:22:00]</a>. Jim Chanos highlights that the current bubble is different from previous ones, with many companies reaching "obscene" market capitalizations of $30-40 billion, compared to $2-5 billion in the past <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:41:00">[13:41:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:55:00">[13:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:59:00">[13:59:00]</a>.

Historically, the average S&P 500 bear market has seen a 30% loss, with recovery typically within 1.5 years (excluding deeper recessions) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:30:00">[18:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:32:00">[18:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:02:00">[19:02:00]</a>. While [[Michael Burrys market predictions and their implications | Michael Burry]] estimates a 50-60% drop in indices, which would take longer to recover (around four years) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:11:00">[19:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:13:00">[19:13:00]</a>, historically, buying during 15-30% falls has yielded good long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:45:00">[19:45:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:48:00">[19:48:00]</a>.

Investors are advised to take a proactive attitude during bear markets, focusing on education and making rational, rather than emotional, decisions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:55:00">[22:55:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:03:00">[23:03:00]</a>. The stock market is a powerful wealth-generating mechanism over 30-50 years, largely due to compounding effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:48:00">[20:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:52:00">[20:52:00]</a>. The greatest risk in the stock market is permanent loss of capital, emphasizing the importance of understanding a business's capacity to generate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:29:00">[30:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:30:00">[30:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:32:00">[30:32:00]</a>. This long-term perspective allows investors to navigate short-term volatility and identify genuine opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:20:00">[51:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="51:23:00">[51:23:00]</a>. Inflation is seen as a "silent robbery" of the middle class, and investing in productive assets like stocks is the primary way to protect purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:29">[01:29:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:31">[01:29:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:33">[01:29:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:40">[01:29:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:43">[01:29:43]</a>.

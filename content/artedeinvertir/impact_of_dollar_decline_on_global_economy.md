The US dollar, considered the world's most important currency, has begun a period of [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. This significant shift is expected to impact the value of currencies, savings, investments, the level of [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]], and the cost of living globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>. Prominent investors like Ray Dalio and Stanley Druckenmiller have warned about the dollar losing value and have begun selling their dollar holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>.

## Reasons for Dollar Dominance and its Impending Challenge

The dollar's status as the world's most important currency grants the United States significant privileges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:55">[00:00:55]</a>. These privileges include:
*   **Ability to Print Money Without High Inflation** The US can print large amounts of new dollars without significant [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] because there is consistent global demand for the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>. Historically, during economic problems, the US has simply activated the printer to solve issues, a capability no other country possesses to the same extent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>. For example, 23% of all dollars in circulation were printed in a single year to address the 2020 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>. This contrasts sharply with countries like Argentina, where similar levels of money printing led to 60% annual [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:06:00">[04:06:00]</a>.
*   **Lower Financing Costs** The dollar's status allows the US and its allies to finance themselves at much lower interest rates than other nations, providing a competitive economic advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:01:00">[05:01:00]</a>. This creates a virtuous cycle where a stronger currency attracts more lending at cheaper rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:29:00">[05:29:00]</a>.

### The BRICS Alliance and the Challenge to Dollar Dominance
An alliance led by [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]] and the BRICS countries (Brazil, Russia, India, [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]], and South Africa) aims to end the [[decline_of_the_us_dollar_as_world_reserve_currency | dominance of the dollar as a world reserve]] currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This new power group was formed to counteract the G7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:00">[01:39:00]</a>. The BRICS group represents 43% of the world's population, compared to the G7's 10%, and more countries are joining to escape dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. They openly plan to stop being subject to dollar power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:00">[02:11:00]</a>. Brazilian President Lula da Silva has stated his objective to end dollar dominance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. This movement is seen as a potential [[impact_of_a_financial_crisis_on_global_stability | economic earthquake]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>.

At the 2022 BRICS Summit, a roadmap to end the dollar's dominance was established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:04:00">[06:04:00]</a>. Since then, the Chinese Renminbi (Yuan) has been gaining market share internationally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:19:00">[06:19:00]</a>. The Dollar Index, which measures the dollar's value against other major currencies, has plummeted over 13% in less than nine months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>. The BRICS countries propose trading within their territory using their own currencies, excluding the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a>.

### Key Factors for Global Currency Dominance
Historically, a currency's status as a world reserve has been associated with military supremacy, which guarantees economic security and currency prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:44:00">[07:44:00]</a>. Spain's currency was a world reserve with military superiority between 1500 and 1700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>. The British pound took over from 1800 to 1900 due to its military superiority <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. For the last 100 years, the dollar and the US military have been the undisputed leaders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]] understands this, investing heavily in its military capabilities, with spending estimated to surpass the US within five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>. This increased military spending is expected to force the US to do the same to maintain hegemony <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:40:00">[08:40:00]</a>.

Another strategy by [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]] and the BRICS is to create a large, tax-free international free trade area, which more than 60% of the world's population is expected to join <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:13:00">[10:13:00]</a>.

## Protecting and Benefiting from Dollar Decline

Financial experts offer advice on how to navigate a declining dollar:

*   **Ray Dalio's Recommendation: Invest in Gold**
    Ray Dalio, a renowned investment fund manager, predicts the dollar's end and advises investors to protect themselves by investing in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:40:00">[11:40:00]</a>. Gold is considered the purest form of money that cannot be printed and protects against currency depreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:58:00">[11:58:00]</a>. Gold has appreciated by an average of 9% annually over the last 20 years, outperforming the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:10:00">[12:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Investment Methods:** Buying physical gold, investing in gold mining companies, or purchasing Gold ETFs (e.g., GLD in the US, EGRN in Europe) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:38:00">[12:38:00]</a>.

*   **Stanley Druckenmiller's View: Sell Dollars, Buy Gold and TIPS**
    Stanley Druckenmiller, an expert on currency value, also advises selling dollars and buying gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:57:00">[13:57:00]</a>. He anticipates a fall in the dollar could cause increased [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:02:00">[14:02:00]</a>. In such a scenario, he recommends investing in US TIPS (Treasury Inflation-Protected Securities), which guarantee a return above [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:12:00">[14:12:00]</a>.
    *   **Investment Methods for TIPS:** Direct bond purchase or through ETFs (e.g., Schwab US TIPS ETF - SCP in the US, BlackRock's ITPE in Europe, which offers a currency-hedged version) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:33:00">[14:33:00]</a>.

*   **Investments in an Inflationary Scenario**
    If the dollar falls and produces [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]], holding liquidity or traditional bonds not protected against [[impact_of_inflation_on_global_markets | inflation]] would be detrimental <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:58:00">[15:58:00]</a>. Real estate investments and stock market shares typically perform satisfactorily during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:09:00">[16:09:00]</a>. The foreign exchange (Forex) market also allows selling one currency against another, such as the US dollar against the Chinese Yuan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:21:00">[16:21:00]</a>.

*   **Stock Market Strategies**
    *   **Export-Oriented US Companies:** Invest in US companies listed in dollars that have significant export components to non-dollar currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:41:00">[16:41:00]</a>. As the dollar weakens, their foreign profits translated back into dollars would increase, leading to stock appreciation. Examples include Rolls Royce and GlaxoSmithKline during Brexit, when the pound fell sharply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:07:00">[17:07:00]</a>.
    *   **Companies with Exposure to [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]]:** Seek out companies with a high degree of exports to [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]] to benefit from its expected economic boom <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:02:00">[18:02:00]</a>. Examples include casinos like Wynn and Las Vegas Sands, and technology companies like Qualcomm <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:10:00">[18:10:00]</a>.
    *   **Luxury Sector Companies:** Companies in the luxury sector (e.g., Louis Vuitton, Hermes, Ferrari) are interesting because their currencies are denominated in euros or dollars, and Chinese consumers are major buyers of luxury goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:29:00">[18:29:00]</a>. An economic boom in [[the_decline_of_the_us_economy_and_rise_of_china | China]] would increase their sales, and profits translated into euros or dollars would rise, providing coverage against a falling dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:39:00">[18:39:00]</a>. These companies have historically prospered in various economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:00:00">[19:00:00]</a>.

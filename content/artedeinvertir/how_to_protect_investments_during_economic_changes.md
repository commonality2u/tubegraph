The global economy is entering a new scenario that is expected to affect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. Famous economist and investor Ray Dalio has indicated a specific date when the world will change significantly, with implications for currency values (like the dollar and euro), real estate, inflation, and the cost of living <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Dalio warns that this new economic scenario will represent the biggest societal and economic change in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. He has offered advice to [[protecting_investments_amidst_economic_uncertainty | protect investments]] and savings in this emerging economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Authority

Ray Dalio is one of the most influential figures in economics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. He manages Bridgewater, the world's largest investment fund, with over $100 billion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:03">[00:01:03]</a>. This figure exceeds the gross domestic product of some countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>. Dalio has a proven track record of accurately predicting major economic changes, successfully protecting his investment portfolios from crises like the 2008 financial crisis and the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. Now a multi-millionaire, Dalio has made his research public, particularly through his book "The New World Order," urging society to adapt to the coming economic reality to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>.

## The Impending Economic Shift

In a recent interview, Ray Dalio revealed the precise date he believes these economic changes will commence, along with the reasons and triggering events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>. He identifies three converging problems:

1.  **Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>: This includes a recession coupled with significant social inequality, leading to societal and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:00">[02:33:00]</a>. Dalio notes that 90% of the American population owns less wealth, while a select 10% holds 75% of the wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this, as governments issued substantial debt to save the economy, which will ultimately be paid through taxes from the working class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **United States Losing Competitive Advantage to China** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>: Dalio describes the United States as a "75-year-old empire that is showing clear signs of decline," in a "terminal phase of the credit cycle" due to extensive debt production and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a>. Historically, the US could issue debt and print new dollars without currency collapse due to its dominant global economic power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:18:00">[04:18:00]</a>. However, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in GDP, military strength, technological innovation, and global influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>. In 2020 alone, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>. China is expected to surpass the US in GDP around 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:31:00">[05:31:00]</a>.

### Ray Dalio's Prediction
Looking ahead, Ray Dalio predicts that within five years, foreigners who have been lending money to the United States may stop, and the dollar may no longer be as easily accepted globally for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. He foresees increased social strife as "difficult times come," with the poor seeking more from the rich, and the rich trying to [[investment_strategies_during_economic_downturns | protect their money]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. Dalio's chart illustrates how the US is entering a decline phase characterized by high debt and alarming money printing, while China is in an ascending phase of wealth creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_for_uncertain_times | Protecting Investments Amidst Economic Uncertainty]]: Ray Dalio's Advice

Ray Dalio has provided specific advice for investors to [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_economic_downturns | protect their savings and investments]] during these economic changes:

### Avoid Liquidity
The first piece of advice is to avoid holding liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>. Due to extensive money printing, inflation appears, which reduces purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. The value of assets like stocks and gold has risen due to the creation of new debt and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. Everyone is "forced to become investors" in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.

### Diversify Broadly
Dalio emphasizes the importance of knowing how to diversify well, including across countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. The goal is for one asset to rise when another falls, maintaining portfolio stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>.

### The "Four Seasons Portfolio" Strategy
Ray Dalio developed the "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory to manage investments, preparing for both good and bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>. He recommends a series of assets:

*   **Stocks (40% of investments)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:18:00">[09:18:00]</a>:
    *   **Emerging Market Stocks**: According to a JP Morgan graph, in the current economic environment (high inflation expected to drop), emerging market stocks perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>. Ray Dalio's portfolio includes several ETFs related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Investing in these through ETFs allows investors to benefit from a basket of stocks representing multiple emerging countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:42:00">[10:42:00]</a>.
    *   **Small-Cap Stocks**: These are also recommended in the current scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:03:00">[10:03:00]</a>. Small-cap stocks have historically yielded returns greater than 17% annually in similar economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Reasons for their positive performance include less market following (leading to potentially cheaper valuations), greater growth potential compared to large, established companies, and inaccessibility for large investors due to liquidity issues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:00">[12:21:00]</a>. ETFs related to small caps, such as the Russell 2000 index ETF (IWM), are a viable option <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:43:00">[11:43:00]</a>.
*   **Gold (small percentage, never exceeding 10%)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>: This can be achieved through ETFs related to gold mining companies or those representing physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:25:00">[13:25:00]</a>. It's noted that in the *current* specific scenario, gold is among the worst performers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds (never exceeding 40% of investments)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>: This includes inflation-protected bonds, which are currently very interesting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:38:00">[13:38:00]</a>. Bonds offer a defensive component, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. However, Dalio observes a "bubble" in the bond market due to new money printing, leading him to apply a more conservative asset allocation to this segment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

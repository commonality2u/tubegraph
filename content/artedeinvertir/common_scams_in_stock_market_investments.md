The world of the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] and investments has become increasingly popular, attracting both genuine investors and unscrupulous individuals seeking to defraud others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>. Scammers use complex and sophisticated deception techniques to take advantage of people's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:46">[00:00:46]</a>. It is crucial to understand these methods to detect and avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Types of Investment Scams

### [[recommendation_scams_in_investing | Recommendation Scams]]

This scam involves a fraudster obtaining contact details (email, phone) of a large group of investors, for example, 10,000 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.
They divide this group into two, sending opposing [[stock_market_investing_strategies | recommendations]] to each <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:09">[00:01:09]</a>. For instance, 5,000 investors might be told Amazon's stock will rise, while the other 5,000 are told it will fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>. Since the stock market allows benefiting from both rises and falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:27">[00:01:27]</a>, the scammer will have 5,000 investors for whom their prediction was "correct" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:30">[00:01:30]</a>.

This process is repeated: the successful group is divided again, and new opposing recommendations are sent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. After about four weeks, out of the initial 10,000, a smaller group (e.g., 625 people) will have received a "perfect" recommendation week after week <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:51">[00:01:51]</a>. These individuals will believe the scammer possesses extraordinary insight, like a "new Warren Buffett" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

At this point, the scam progresses in one of two ways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>:
1.  **Fee for Recommendations**: They demand a significant sum of money for continued "magical recommendations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. However, these future recommendations will yield mediocre or below-average results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.
2.  **Managed Account Deposit**: They request money to be deposited into an account that they will manage, promising to multiply it infinitely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:17">[00:02:17]</a>. In this scenario, either the deposited cash disappears within weeks and the scammers vanish <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>, or they operate the money through affiliated brokers of dubious reputation, generating many commissions that lead to the investor losing all their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

### Pyramid Schemes and Multilevel Systems Applied to the Stock Market

These systems are particularly dangerous as victims often lose their money and involve family and friends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. The product or service offered (e.g., [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | stock market investments]], cryptocurrencies, gold) is merely an excuse to comply with the law and avoid suspicion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

The scammer promises potential investors two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>:
1.  **Capital Safety**: Their capital will be "totally safe" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
2.  **High Returns**: They will receive extremely high returns, such as 1% daily or 15% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

To facilitate money deposits, additional conditions are set:
*   Money must be invested for a minimum period (e.g., 3, 6, or 12 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   Exponentially higher benefits are promised if new people are brought into the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>.

The "secret" of this system is that new participants' blocked money is used to pay existing participants who wish to withdraw, giving the system a false sense of credibility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. However, because everyone believes they are "earning" fictitious money, few initially withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

These pyramids grow until more capital leaves than enters, leading to panic when older investors cannot be paid their promised benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. Everyone rushes to withdraw, realizing the scam <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.
Examples include the Forum Filat√©lico and Afinsa scams in Spain, which affected over 190,000 people and swindled more than 2.5 billion euros by promising investments in stamps and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>.

> [!CAUTION]
> If you hear terms like "network marketing," "multilevel marketing," "networks," or "pyramids," especially when linked to high returns and bringing in new people, it is strongly advised to distance yourself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>. Pyramid schemes have been illegal in most countries for over a century but adapt by attaching a product or service as an excuse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.

### [[trading_robot_scams | Trading Robot Scams]]

This scam offers a computer program or algorithm that supposedly operates automatically and generates consistent profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:00">[00:07:00]</a>. Scammers often provide fake evidence like screenshots of bank statements or real-time trading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

The fundamental flaw in this scam is the premise: why would anyone sell such a powerful, automatically money-generating tool for a "ridiculous amount" (e.g., less than ten thousand dollars)? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>
While real algorithms exist that produce profits (e.g., 98% of days for Bank of America) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>, they are developed by large institutions like Bank of America or JP Morgan with enormous investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. These powerful algorithms are used solely for the institutions' benefit and are not available to clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. The idea that an ordinary person could create an algorithm to beat these institutions and sell it for a few hundred dollars is illogical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

> [!TIP]
> Stay away from "[[trading_robot_scams | trading robot]]" products or algorithms that promise effortless money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>.

### [[fake_wealth_management_advisory_scams | Fake Wealth Management Advisory Scams]]

These companies often contact potential victims via phone, using high-pressure sales tactics and typically employing women with pleasant voices to target a male audience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>.

The ingenious method used is as follows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>:
1.  **Initial Friendly Call**: They present themselves as a reliable company with the necessary permits to manage capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.
2.  **"Free Money" Deposit**: If skepticism is detected, they offer to open an account in your name and deposit their own money (e.g., 20,000 euros) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>. They claim to operate with this money to show their method works, stating that if they lose it, it's their loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>. They even provide passwords for you to monitor the account's growth on an online platform (which is manipulated) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
3.  **Growth and Second Call**: The supposed 20,000 euros magically grow, perhaps to 50,000 euros, with a fabricated history of operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:23">[00:10:23]</a>. They then call again, proposing that you deposit 20,000 euros into the account so they can withdraw their initial capital, leaving you in control of an account that seemingly has grown to 50,000 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:40">[00:10:40]</a>.

At this point, many people, driven by greed, take the bait <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>. Once the victim deposits their 20,000 euros:
*   The company will disappear, cutting off all contact, and the victim loses their money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:11">[00:11:11]</a>.
*   Victims' greed might lead them to deposit even more money, losing even larger sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.
*   Sophisticated organizations might be in cahoots with low-reputation brokers. The deposited money is moved through numerous operations, generating high commissions that benefit the organization and the colluding broker, or it is operated in derivatives where the broker is the counterparty, funneling the unwary's losses into their pockets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

> [!IMPORTANT]
> If you are considering a company to [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | invest]] your money, ensure it is regulated by the highest [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.

### "Smoke Sellers" / Fake Experts

These are supposed experts who claim to have an infallible method to beat the market and are willing to reveal it for a price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. Their marketing often includes luxury items like Lamborghinis, lavish homes, or photos of investors working from laptops on "paradisiacal beaches" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>.

They promise high returns with little effort and minimal capital, such as generating a monthly salary from 3,000 euros of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>, or even a daily return of 1% (which equates to an annual return of 3700% or multiplying capital by 37 times in a year) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Such claims are total nonsense; no one has developed or will develop such a system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>.

These "experts" often adorn their methods or training with "awards" from dubious organizations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:25">[00:13:25]</a>. Investigation often reveals these organizations grant awards to all their associates annually, simply for marketing purposes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:30">[00:13:30]</a>.

Another variant is individuals posing as professional investors by claiming to have managed hedge funds in exotic jurisdictions like Panama or the Cayman Islands, where it is difficult for clients to verify such claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>. Others claim to manage "family offices" to gain reputation, but in Spain, this term does not have an established legal figure allowing management of other people's money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. In reality, these individuals often lack the necessary qualifications and experience to manage funds, making a living by selling these "infallible methods" or training courses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:17">[00:14:17]</a>.

## Preventing Scams

The most important way to avoid falling victim to these scammers is not to be swayed by greed and to recognize that nothing is given for free <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>. Always be wary of promises of high returns with little to no risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. If, in addition to high returns, you are required to attract new people to the "business opportunity," your distrust should be even greater <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>.

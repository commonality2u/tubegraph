According to famous economist and investor Ray Dalio, the "new world order" will usher in an economic recession without precedent, primarily due to three new, unprepared-for problems. He states these challenges are "the most important of our lives" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. Dalio predicts an economic war that could lead to the decline of the United States and its allies in favor of China, drastically changing the economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. Such changes will significantly impact the value of money, investments, and currencies like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:33">[00:00:33]</a>.

Ray Dalio holds significant global economic influence, being a regular at the Davos forum meetings and the founder of the world's largest hedge fund, with over $100 trillion in assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. His opinions are highly respected, especially given his success in navigating major economic crises like those in 2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He has recently condensed his views on this new scenario, which involves serious economic changes requiring preparation, in his book *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Three Major Challenges

In a CNBC interview, Ray Dalio outlined three forces he considers "the greatest that I have seen in my entire life" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Historically, the simultaneous occurrence of these problems has led to economic recessions, significant changes, and the end of empires and major world currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### 1. Social Gap Between Classes
The first problem is a "class struggle" between capitalism and communism, or "between those who have and those who don't," where both sides seek to win at all costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. This growing social gap is generating future tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>. Data indicates that 1% of the American population increasingly owns more wealth, while the poorest 50% own less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. Recent inflation has exacerbated this gap, as the poorest 50% often lack assets like stocks or real estate that protect against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### 2. Enormous Debt
The second problem is the "enormous amount of debt" held by both the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Dalio observes decreasing demand for United States debt and considers American bonds a "very risky investment" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. He predicts two outcomes: either interest rates for debt payments will rise, or the state will have to print more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Printing more money to solve recessions would lead to higher inflation, further increasing the wealth disparity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### 3. Rise of China and Decline of the United States
The third problem is the rise of China and the perceived decline of the United States, which would significantly affect the dollar's value as a global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. While the U.S. has dominated the international political landscape for 70 years through institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, this is "about to change" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. Dalio's analysis suggests the U.S. is entering a decline phase marked by high debt levels, social struggles, and currency devaluation, while China is in an ascending phase of wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

Dalio predicts that in "5 years we will see a totally different world than the current one," driven by the rise of China, the class struggle, and the debt bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Technological changes, such as Artificial Intelligence, could also introduce unpredictable scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_for_economic_downturns | Investment Strategies for Uncertain Economic Times]]

In response to these complex challenges, Ray Dalio offers recommendations for small investors to navigate this environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>:

### 1. Invest Globally and Guard Against Inflation
Dalio advises investors to "look at your investments in a global way" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. To prevent money from losing value due to inflation, he stresses the necessity of investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:29">[00:05:29]</a>. He notes that since money printing began, asset values, such as stocks or gold, have risen due to new debt and money creation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. He strongly cautions against holding seemingly safe assets like liquidity, as their value typically decreases in inflationary scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

> "You do not want to have things that you think are safe such as liquidity." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>

Real assets with consistent demand, such as stocks, real estate investments, or gold, are expected to perform "much better relatively in this new scenario" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### 2. Diversify Strategically
Dalio emphasizes that living in a world with "a lot of uncertainty and risks" requires learning to diversify without reducing performance expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. He states that "good diversification can reduce your risk in a 80%" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>. He consistently recommends investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. Ray Dalio popularized the "four seasons" portfolio management theory for powerful diversification <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Current Investment Holdings

Observing Ray Dalio's recently published portfolio, his preferred sector for investment is technology. He holds shares in companies such as Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

Conversely, he has been selling positions in the banking sector, including shares of Bank of America and JP Morgan. This is likely due to the sector's sensitivity to the economic cycle, which he aims to avoid given potential future problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>.

While Dalio typically holds a significant portion of his portfolio in debt or long-term bonds, his current main positions are in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>. Another favored sector for the current environment is stable or defensive consumer companies, including businesses like Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>.

He has also invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF, ticker IWM, which comprises 2,000 major small-cap companies in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Historically, when interest rates have dropped and liquidity increased, these small-cap stocks tend to outperform the market average and large companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

This article explores the [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | investment opportunities]] in Volkswagen and International Airlines Group (IAG), drawing insights from market analysis and financial data.

## Volkswagen (VOW3)

Volkswagen is presented as potentially the most significant automotive holding company globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>. The company operates in Germany under the ticker VOW3, with shares priced at 130 euros per share at the time of the analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### Company Overview
Volkswagen's extensive operations include:
*   Annual sales exceeding 250 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>.
*   Production of over 11 million cars annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.
*   A workforce of more than 600,000 employees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>.
*   An operating profit nearing 20 billion euros per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:10">[00:09:10]</a>.

Beyond its namesake brand, Volkswagen owns a portfolio of renowned brands, including Audi, Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, Skoda, Seat, and the iconic motorcycle brand Ducati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>. Interestingly, Porsche is highlighted as Volkswagen Group's most profitable brand, generating over 4 billion euros in operating profits annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:32">[00:09:32]</a>. This contrasts with Ferrari, a main rival, which has an operating profit of 1 billion euros per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">[00:09:39]</a>.

### Strategic Positioning
Volkswagen's Audi brand possesses advanced technologies within the automotive sector, positioning the group to compete directly with Tesla in the electric car market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:12">[00:10:12]</a>. Investing in car companies requires assessing their readiness for the emerging electric vehicle market, where technological advancement is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:26">[00:10:26]</a>. The company has also moved past the "dieselgate" scandal and potential fines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:22">[00:11:22]</a>.

### Valuation and Growth Potential
Two methods are proposed for Volkswagen's [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuation and growth potential]]:

#### 1. Sum of Parts Valuation (if luxury division is spun off)
There are rumors that the Volkswagen group might independently list its luxury car division, which includes Porsche, Lamborghini, Bentley, Bugatti, and Ducati <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   **Luxury Sector:** Valuing the luxury sector comparably to Ferrari (which is publicly listed) suggests a value of over 260 euros per share for this segment alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. This value would justify double Volkswagen's current stock price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.
*   **Remaining Group:** The rest of the Volkswagen group would have an approximate value of 200 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:57">[00:10:57]</a>.
*   **Total Potential:** This approach suggests a potential combined value of 450 euros per share, a significant upside for a company currently trading at 130 euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>. This potential considers Volkswagen's low debt, minor impact from recent economic problems, and expected return to 2019 earnings levels by 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:13">[00:11:13]</a>.

#### 2. Traditional Valuation (without luxury division separation)
Assuming no separation of the luxury division, future profits are estimated:
*   While earnings are expected to be lower in the current and next year, by 2023, Volkswagen is estimated to earn 25 euros per share, matching its 2019 profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.
*   Historically, Volkswagen and other car brands have traded at a P/E ratio higher than 8 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>.
*   Applying this multiple (8x earnings), a target price of 200 euros per share is derived <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>. This represents an attractive potential for a market leader trading at 130 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>.

## International Airlines Group (IAG)

IAG, or International Airlines Group, is an [[investment_analysis_of_airlines_banking_and_semiconductor_sectors | airline]] business holding company listed in London and Madrid under the ticker IAG, trading at 3 euros per share at the time of analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. It comprises two major [[investment_opportunities_in_fast_food_and_airline_industries | airlines]]: British Airways and the Spanish Iberia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

### Current Challenges and Operating Costs
The [[investment_analysis_of_airlines_banking_and_semiconductor_sectors | airline]] industry is currently facing a very complicated period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>. IAG has received financial aid from the UK and Spain, which its CEO believes provides sufficient liquidity to navigate the crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:31">[00:12:31]</a>. However, demand for flights is not expected to return to normal before the year 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.

Given the airline industry's lack of competitive advantages and its cyclical nature, low operating costs are crucial for long-term prosperity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:51">[00:12:51]</a>.
*   Efficient operators like Ryanair have costs as low as 3.5 cents per seat and per kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a>.
*   Less efficient rivals, such as IAG and Lufthansa, have costs closer to 8 cents per seat per kilometer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>. This significant difference explains the long-term success of companies like Ryanair and EasyJet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:48">[00:13:48]</a>.

### Valuation and Risks
IAG has historically traded at an average Price-to-Earnings (P/E) ratio of 7 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:59">[00:13:59]</a>.
*   Based on estimated earnings of 80 cents per share, multiplying this by 7 times earnings yields a target price of 5.60 euros per share for a three-year horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>.
*   With shares currently trading at 3 euros, this represents considerable potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:13">[00:14:13]</a>.

However, several risks are associated with IAG:
*   A certain level of debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:18">[00:14:18]</a>.
*   Operation in a cyclical industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>.
*   Potential for impact from a "second wave" of current global problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:24">[00:14:24]</a>.

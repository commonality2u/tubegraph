### 6. Buffettology by Mary Buffett and David Clark

Buffett's success stems from applying two concepts: value [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]] (buying and understanding businesses cheaply, as taught by Benjamin Graham) and quality [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]] (not only buying the cheapest, but businesses with inherent quality) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:38:00">[08:38:00]</a>.

*   **Difficulty:** Low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>.

*   **Difficulty:** Medium to High <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:02:00">[10:02:00]</a>.

Examples include Amazon, Google, and Domino's Pizza <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:28:00">[10:28:00]</a>.
    *   **Focus on Business Fundamentals:** Emphasizes analyzing whether businesses are solid, have large potential markets, and are well-managed, rather than solely focusing on numbers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:48:00">[10:48:00]</a>.
    *   **Investment Checklist:** Includes a checklist of questions investors should ask themselves when evaluating potential investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:57:00">[10:57:00]</a>.

### 8. The Alchemy of Finance by George Soros
This book, unfortunately not translated into Spanish, is highly recommended <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. George Soros is considered the most successful modern speculator of the modern era (from the 1960s and 70s) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a>.

*   **Key Concepts:**
    *   **Reflexivity:** Popularized the concept of reflexivity, explaining how the price of a stock or asset can directly influence its fundamentals and real-life behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:18:00">[12:18:00]</a>.
    *   **Speculation vs. Value Investing:** Soros's style is based more on speculation and shorter-term operations, sometimes using debt, differing from traditional value [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:05:00">[12:05:00]</a>.
    *   **Portfolio Management Diary:** Includes a diary of his [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | portfolio]] movements and reasoning over approximately two years, offering a practical insight into his decision-making <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:50:00">[12:50:00]</a>.

### 9. Value Investing by Bruce Greenwald

    *   Provides practical examples of the margin of safety, intrinsic value, and understanding competitive advantages of a business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:49:00">[13:49:00]</a>.
    *   Explains what a "value trap" is and covers different ratios used in value [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]], such as PER (Price-to-Earnings Ratio) and book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.
*   **Outcome:** Offers the necessary tools to understand and begin practicing the value [[investment_education_and_strategies | investing]] style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:04:00">[14:04:00]</a>.

### 10. The Confusion of Confusions by Joseph de la Vega
Considered the first book ever written about the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]], published over 300 years ago by a Spaniard <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:18:00">[14:18:00]</a>.

*   **Key Insight:** Like Livermore's biography, this historical book reveals that anecdotes and human behavior in the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] have changed very little over centuries, especially regarding psychology and mass behavior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:39:00">[14:39:00]</a>. This makes it particularly interesting for understanding the timeless aspects of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:00">[14:48:00]</a>.

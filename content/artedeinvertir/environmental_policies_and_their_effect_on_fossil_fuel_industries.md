The "2030 agenda," also known as "global objectives" or the "global agenda for the world," is an economic and social reform plan that is expected to significantly impact savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>. Designed in 2015 at the Davos forum, this agenda has the support of powerful individuals and organizations like Bill Gates, Ray Dalio, state presidents, and the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:26">[00:00:26]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>. Some experts suggest that the policies promoted by the 2030 agenda may be contributing to the current economic crisis and high inflation levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:36">[00:00:36]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

## Impact on Energy Markets and Inflation

A key aspect of the 2030 agenda focuses on environmental protection, which is presented as a valid objective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>. However, the proposed method to achieve this involves a radical approach to energy policy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:52">[00:09:52]</a>.

Specifically, the agenda suggests:
*   Completely eliminating the use of fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>.
*   Implementing this [[Energy crisis and geopolitical tensions | energy transition]] without clear, strategic planning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:00">[00:10:00]</a>.
*   Establishing price limits on gas or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

These policies are believed to be a major cause of the current [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation crisis]] due to high fossil fuel prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. Rising inflation has historically led to increased poverty and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:17">[00:10:17]</a>.

## Investment Decline in Fossil Fuel Industries

Over the past seven years, coinciding with the 2030 agenda's implementation, a "battle against fossil fuels" has been established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>. This push for an unplanned [[Energy crisis and geopolitical tensions | energy transition]] has led to a significant lack of investment in the sector, resulting in higher [[effects_of_rising_energy_and_commodity_prices | energy prices]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:35">[00:10:35]</a>.

Since changes in policies regarding fossil fuels began, investment in oil exploitation and production has plummeted by 60%, from $600 billion annually to less than $200 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

## Beneficiaries Amidst the Crisis

Despite the overall market collapse in 2022, oil and gas companies have emerged as star investments due to the high price levels of fossil fuels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

This trend was anticipated by investors like [[warren_buffetts_investment_in_the_energy_sector | Warren Buffett]], who began investing in the sector months before oil prices surged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. Specifically, [[warren_buffetts_investment_in_the_energy_sector | Warren Buffett]] has made an aggressive investment of over $10 billion in Occidental Oil (NYSE: OXY), a leading company in oil extraction and processing in regions such as the Permian Basin, the Gulf of Mexico, and Oman <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a><a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Occidental Oil benefits from low extraction costs and substantial oil reserves <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:48">[00:11:48]</a>. Currently, the company trades at six times earnings, below its historical average of ten times earnings, and has a strong program for returning profits to shareholders through dividends and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:54">[00:11:54]</a>.

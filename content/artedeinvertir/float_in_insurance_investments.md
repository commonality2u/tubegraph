Float in insurance investments is a key concept that has significantly contributed to [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_liquidity_accumulation | Warren Buffett's wealth generation]] [03:52]. It refers to "that money that we have but that does not belong to us, we can invest it for our own benefit before being paid in the form of insurance compensation" [04:08].

## How Float Works
When a policyholder pays an insurance premium, such as for car, house, or life insurance, the insurer receives this money upfront [04:20]. For example, if a policyholder pays $1,000, and the insurer statistically expects to pay only $900 in compensation over the next 6, 12, or 24 months, the insurer can invest that $1,000 in the interim [04:20], [04:46]. This period of investment exists because compensation processes, such as trials, can be lengthy [04:43].

Unlike banks, which must pay interest to depositors, the law allows insurers to retain and invest this float without paying interest to policyholders [04:51], [05:00], [05:03]. This means insurers profit in two ways: first, from the inherent profit margin of selling the insurance itself, and second, from investing the advance payments received from policyholders [05:05], [05:12].

## Investment Strategy and Float
While regulations prevent insurers from investing the entire float in high-risk ventures like the stock market due to potential short-term volatility [05:25], they typically invest the majority in conservative assets like treasury bills, fixed income, or short-term bonds (with a maximum duration of 3 to 5 years) [05:38], [05:44]. A smaller portion, perhaps 10-15%, may be allocated to [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market investments]] or real estate [05:47].

[[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_liquidity_accumulation | Warren Buffett]] innovated by investing a larger portion of this float in stocks than traditional insurance companies [06:09]. Studies suggest that 40% to 50% of his historical investment performance stems from this intelligent utilization of float and his exceptional investment ability [06:21], [06:32].

As of March 2024, Berkshire Hathaway manages a float of $168 billion from its insurance operations [06:49]. Even a conservative annual return of 5-7% on this float can generate over $20 billion in pre-tax profits for Berkshire Hathaway [07:03], [07:16], highlighting its enormous contribution to the company's value [07:24]. This float has also shown consistent growth over time [07:26].

## Float and Profitability Metrics
The profitability of an insurance business can be understood through two main results:
1.  **Investment of Float**: Profits generated from investing the float [08:15].
2.  **Technical Result**: Profit earned directly from selling insurance [08:16].

The **combined ratio** is a key metric that indicates the profit an insurer makes solely from the sale of insurance [08:23], [08:25]. It is calculated as 100 minus the combined ratio percentage, giving the profit margin [08:33]. A combined ratio below 100% indicates a profit from insurance sales, while above 100% means selling at a loss [08:44]. Some companies, like State Farm (with a 107% combined ratio), might knowingly sell insurance at a loss simply to acquire the float for investment [08:41], [08:57].

The combined ratio is composed of:
*   **Loss Ratio**: The percentage of premiums paid out as compensation [09:09], [09:11].
*   **Expense Ratio**: Costs related to brokers, commissions, and administrative expenses [09:20], [09:34].

## Examples of Float-Utilizing Companies

### GEICO
[[warren_buffetts_investment_in_the_insurance_sector | GEICO]], an automobile low-cost insurance company, is a historical example of a highly profitable float investment for Warren Buffett [02:15], [02:18]. Its income has "skyrocketed" from very little in 1998 to almost $20 billion, representing a significant portion of Buffett's fortune [02:23], [02:29], [02:34].

### Chubb (CB)
Chubb (ticker: CB) is a publicly listed insurance company in which [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_liquidity_accumulation | Warren Buffett]] has made a significant investment of almost $7 billion [00:05], [01:14], [02:48], [04:30]. This investment was initially kept secret at Buffett's request to the SEC [00:14], [01:10], and was only recently made public [00:18].

Key aspects of Chubb:
*   **Valuation**: Trading at 12 times earnings, which is significantly lower than the S&P 500 average (20 times earnings) and large technology companies (nearly 30 times earnings) [01:41], [01:59], [03:41].
*   **Profitability**: In 2023, Chubb generated $9 billion in profit, with almost 60% ($5 billion) coming from the [[Stock market investments and strategies | investment of its float]] [10:18], [10:27].
*   **Combined Ratio**: Chubb consistently maintains a lower combined ratio (e.g., 86% last year, implying a 14% profit margin from insurance sales) compared to its rivals, indicating strong underwriting discipline and a [[Protecting investments amidst economic uncertainty | competitive advantage]] [02:58], [07:05], [28:30], [28:50], [29:01], [29:06].
*   **Investment Philosophy**: Chubb has a conservative investment philosophy, with 84% of its float invested in debt with a maximum duration of 5 years [31:03], [31:07]. Its portfolio of $120 billion is 93% invested in high-quality bonds (double A to triple B) [31:44], [32:03], [32:06].
*   **Float Size**: Chubb holds a float of $120 billion [32:33], which is equivalent to two to three full years of its insurance sales [33:20], [33:26], indicating a higher proportion of multi-year policies [33:32].
*   **Debt**: With a book value of $60 billion and only $15 billion in debt, its debt-to-book value ratio is about 0.25, which is considered very low [30:06], [30:10], [30:18]. It has a credit rating of AA from S&P, signifying high credit quality [30:25], [30:31].
*   **Historical Performance**: Chubb has an impressive track record, multiplying its stock value by over 30 times since its listing, in addition to paying dividends [25:00], [28:17], [28:23]. Its earnings per share have grown from $3 in 2005 to $24, an eightfold increase [34:00]. Its return on equity averages 12-13% [34:33], [35:20].
*   **Impact of Interest Rates**: Higher interest rates, such as those seen since 2022, positively impact Chubb's profitability because its float can be invested at higher yields (e.g., 5.5% in US Treasury bills) [34:57], [35:00], [35:12]. Conversely, low interest rates have historically hurt insurance companies' profitability [34:53], [34:57].
*   **Buffett's Potential Strategy**: It is speculated that [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_liquidity_accumulation | Warren Buffett]] might be building an initial position in Chubb with the intent to acquire the entire company [32:23], [33:03]. This would allow him to more aggressively invest Chubb's float (currently yielding 3-4%) at higher returns, potentially increasing profits by 50-60% [32:42], [32:57], [33:00].

### Kinsale Capital Group
Kinsale Capital Group (ticker: KNSL) is another insurer that has given historical returns exceeding 30% per year [07:54], [07:56]. It has multiplied its stock value by 20 times in the last 5-7 years [36:46]. Kinsale specializes in the "excess and surplus lines" market, insuring high-risk activities with specific needs (e.g., construction, commercial transportation, electricians, landscapers) where traditional insurers might not operate due to a lack of historical data and high variability of risk [37:32], [37:52], [38:58].

Key advantages of Kinsale:
*   **Specialized Knowledge**: Kinsale has developed specific knowledge and a large database of these niche risks [39:17], [40:30].
*   **Higher Pricing**: Due to less competition, it can charge higher prices, compensating for the increased risk [41:22], [41:23].
*   **Contrarian Underwriting**: The company employs a "contrarian underwriting" approach, similar to a contrarian [[Stock market investments and strategies | investment strategy]] [40:37]. For example, after a major event like a hurricane, when other insurers raise prices significantly due to fear, Kinsale leverages its solid capital base to absorb the risk and issue policies at higher, more profitable rates [40:48], [41:14], [41:26].
*   **Low Cost Model**: Kinsale operates with a low-cost model and maintains direct control over policy issuance, avoiding outsourcing [42:49], [42:53].
*   **Market Share & Growth**: Despite rapid growth, Kinsale holds only 1.1% market share in its $100 billion annual niche market, indicating significant room for further growth [43:13], [43:15], [43:56], [43:58]. The company's profits have soared, with expected earnings of $15 per share in 2024, up from $2 in 2016 [44:17], [44:20], [44:23].
*   **Combined Ratio**: Kinsale's combined ratio (77% average, implying a 23% profit margin) is consistently better than its competitors [45:34], [45:47], with a particularly strong loss ratio (55%) and expense ratio (22%) [44:49], [44:52], [45:02], [45:11], [45:29], [45:39].
*   **Investment Portfolio**: Kinsale's $3 billion investment portfolio is conservatively managed, mostly in corporate bonds (triple-A to triple-B), with a small portion in equities (9%) [46:04], [46:10], [46:14], [46:26].
*   **Recent Stock Drop**: A recent drop in the stock was due to market fears of slowing growth, as premium issuance growth decreased from over 30% to 25% year-over-year [47:01], [47:06], [47:09], [47:27]. This slowdown is partly attributed to reduced price inflation in the insurance sector (now 3-4%) compared to prior years [48:00], [48:07], [48:31]. Despite this, it remains a high-growth insurer [49:44].

### Markel
Markel (ticker: MKL) is presented as a smaller alternative to Berkshire Hathaway, following a similar business model [52:54], [52:57]. It combines insurance operations with a float that is invested in bonds, stocks, or used to acquire entire companies [53:02], [53:07], [53:10]. Markel's stock performance has been impressive, growing from $8 to $1,600 per share [53:17], [53:20].

Key aspects of Markel:
*   **Book Value Growth**: The evolution of its book value is "spectacular" and generally stable, despite minor dips during economic downturns (e.g., 2008, 2018, 2020) [53:24], [53:28], [53:36].
*   **Business Stability**: Insurance is a very predictable and non-cyclical sector, as most governments require certain types of insurance (e.g., car insurance), and people generally need home or life insurance [53:44], [53:51], [53:56], [54:01], [54:06].
*   **Growth**: Markel averages 10% sales growth and over 15% profit growth annually [54:21], [54:25], [54:27].
*   **Investment Strategy**: Markel's investment director, Thomas Giner, follows a prudent, long-term philosophy similar to [[warren_buffetts_investment_strategy_and_liquidity_accumulation | Warren Buffett]] [54:41], [54:47], [54:51]. Markel manages $26 billion in float [55:07], and aggressively invests approximately 35% ($9 billion) of its portfolio in equity securities, similar to Buffett's approach [55:13], [55:15], [55:20]. The rest is invested in bonds [55:37].
*   **Stock Portfolio Quality**: Markel's stock portfolio is highly diversified and composed of high-quality companies such as Disney, Watsco, Microsoft, Apple, Progressive, KKR, Meta, Amazon, Google, and Brookfield, with a primary position in Berkshire Hathaway itself [55:48], [55:50], [56:12]. Its stock selection has yielded strong returns (e.g., +21% in 2023, +29% in 2021) [56:32], [56:45].
*   **Valuation**: Markel currently trades at a price-to-book value of 1.4, which is its historical average [57:31], [57:34], and lower than its valuation five years ago in 2018 [58:08], [58:10]. Future performance is expected to be driven by book value growth, projected at 10-12% for 2024 and 2025 [57:40], [57:56].

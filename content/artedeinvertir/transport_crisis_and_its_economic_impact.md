The transport crisis is identified as one of four major crises contributing to significant volatility in the global economy and stock markets in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This new economic scenario is expected to affect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a>.

## Causes of the Crisis
The crisis is characterized by a global logistical collapse, with ports literally jammed and transport costs escalating dramatically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>. For example, the cost of transporting a typical container surged from $1,500-$2,000 to over $10,000, a fivefold increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. The head of logistics at Uber described the situation as "Armageddon" at the logistics and transportation level, noting a lack of apparent solutions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:26">[00:01:26]</a>.

Key factors contributing to this crisis include:
*   **Worker Shortages** Due to confinements and increased cases, many workers are unable to occupy their jobs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. There is also a shortage of qualified workers willing to dedicate themselves to this sector, as the economy has evolved <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. This has led to a "through the roof" demand for road, maritime, and air transport workers in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:06">[00:02:06]</a>.
*   **Increased Wages** Companies are compelled to significantly raise wages to attract workers, which in turn impacts the cost of all consumed products and goods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:28">[00:02:28]</a>.

## Economic Impacts
The transport crisis has several immediate and serious implications for the economy:
*   **Supply Problems and Higher Costs** The logistical collapse leads to supply problems, meaning goods arrive at a higher cost because all transport expenses have increased. Producers consequently have to raise their prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:42">[00:00:42]</a>.
*   **[[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | Inflation]]** The increased costs across all products and services, whether imported or consumed, contribute to [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>. This is a serious problem that worsens the economic situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a>.
*   **Reduced Consumption** As prices rise, people have less disposable income and cannot consume as much <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. Consumption accounts for 70% of the economy, so a decrease negatively impacts the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:48">[00:02:48]</a>.
*   **Stock Market Valuation Adjustments** Reduced business profits due to higher costs are reflected in stock prices, leading to a negative impact on stock market valuations and share prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>.

## Mitigating Factors and Beneficiaries
Despite the widespread negative impacts, certain companies and sectors can benefit from this crisis:
*   **Transport Companies** Companies involved in transporting goods, particularly those with high-quality business models, can see increased profits as transport rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:11">[00:22:11]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **C.H. Robinson** A high-quality company listed in the Dow Jones transport index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">[00:22:19]</a>.
    *   **Expeditors International** An interesting company that connects transport companies with those needing transport, profiting from increased transport costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:23">[00:22:23]</a>.
    *   **J.B. Hunt** An exceptional company in the transport sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:55">[00:22:55]</a>.
    *   **Union Pacific** A rail transport company known for low and predictable transport costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:03">[00:23:03]</a>.
    *   **Transforce International (TFII)** A Canadian company that has seen significant stock market gains since the crisis began in 2020 by acquiring and improving poorly managed smaller transport companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:30">[00:23:30]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy** To mitigate risks, investors should analyze sectors that benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:32">[00:17:32]</a>. Even in crises, certain market segments benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">[00:17:44]</a>. Investing capital to generate profitability is crucial, especially in an [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflationary]] environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:56">[00:17:56]</a>. Companies offering dividend income higher than [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation]] provide protection and additional benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:07">[00:18:07]</a>. Holding fixed income or liquidity is dangerous as it loses purchasing power due to [[Energy crisis and its effect on inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:10">[00:18:10]</a>.

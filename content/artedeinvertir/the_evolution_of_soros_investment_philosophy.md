[[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | George Soros]], a Hungarian refugee from World War II, developed a unique investment approach that significantly contributed to his substantial wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:00">[01:10:00]</a>. His investment philosophy evolved from an initial focus on value investing to a sophisticated system based on his "theory of reflexivity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:00">[02:51:00]</a>.

## Early Life and Influences

[[Soros early life and education | Soros's early life and education]] were pivotal in shaping his worldview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. His parents managed to falsify papers, allowing him to travel to the United Kingdom during the Nazi invasion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:00">[01:12:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. With certain income, he was able to access the London Business School, a powerful institution that granted good credentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:00">[01:29:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:00">[01:31:00]</a>.

[[Soros early life and education | Soros]] considers philosophy, not investment, his real passion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:46:00">[01:46:00]</a>. One of his mentors was Karl Popper, and from that point, he sought to merge philosophy with investment, which led to the development of his theory of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:00">[01:56:00]</a>. After graduating, he faced difficulties finding a job due to a deeply racist or xenophobic society, taking on jobs like door-to-door vacuum cleaner sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. He eventually entered the financial world through a contact who was also Hungarian <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>.

## Investment Style Evolution

Initially, [[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | Soros]] started as a value investor, focusing on investing in cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:40:00">[02:40:00]</a>. Over the years, his philosophy evolved, driven by the desire to maximize profit, leading him to modify his style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:00">[02:49:00]</a>. He gained a reputation by identifying cheap German stocks, particularly those with dual stock structures like common and preferred shares, akin to Korean preferreds today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:58:00">[02:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>. His successful reports for clients allowed him to found his fund, the Quantum Fund, in 1970 with $23 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:28">[00:00:28]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:32:00">[03:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:44:00">[03:44:00]</a>. Most of its growth has been organic, as it reached a point where it no longer accepted external clients, demonstrating the power of compound interest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:57:00">[03:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:02:00">[04:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:07:00">[04:07:00]</a>.

## The Theory of Reflexivity

[[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | Soros]]'s philosophy, particularly his theory of reflexivity, has been central to his success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He explains this theory in his book, "The Alchemy of Finance," which he advises reading with a deep knowledge of finance due to its complexity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:27:00">[04:27:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:48:00">[04:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:54:00">[04:54:00]</a>.

His core belief is that the financial system is a human construct <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:00">[05:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Unlike natural phenomena (like weather), financial crises cannot be reliably predicted, because if they could be predicted, they would not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:58:00">[05:58:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>. He argues that it's difficult to predict the economy's future due to countless factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:38:00">[06:38:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

Instead, [[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | Soros]] emphasizes focusing on the perception investors will have of the economy, akin to a "second derivative" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:51:00">[06:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:54:00">[06:54:00]</a>. Financial markets, he states, are a common mentality created by participants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:02:00">[07:02:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. This links to quantum theory, where the observer influences the observed element <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. When market participants form a vision, they influence the market itself, creating a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:23:00">[07:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:33:00">[07:33:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>.

[[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | Soros]] rejects the theory of efficient markets because participants act based on emotions, feelings, and perceptions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:51:00">[08:51:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:53:00">[08:53:00]</a>. He argues that markets are inherently unstable and biased, either upwards or downwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:25:00">[08:25:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:27:00">[08:27:00]</a>. His approach does not rely on technical analysis but is always supported by fundamental themes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:39:00">[09:39:00]</a>.

He typically operates in four or five asset classes:
*   Gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>
*   Oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>
*   Currencies of countries with sufficient liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:37:00">[05:37:00]</a>
*   Common stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>
*   Index futures (long or short) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>

### Boom and Bust Patterns

[[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | Soros]]'s theory of reflexivity focuses on identifying "boom" and "bust" patterns, also known as bubbles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:08:00">[08:08:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>. In a reflective process, when perception (red line) perfects about a sector or currency, the price (blue line) often lags initially <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:07:00">[09:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. Once identified, the price tends to rise much faster than the fundamentals suggest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:54:00">[10:54:00]</a>.

The theory includes a "test period" in every bubble, both upwards and downwards, where prices might stabilize or even slightly fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:07:00">[11:07:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:10:00">[11:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:30:00">[11:30:00]</a>. If this fall isn't too abrupt and people regain confidence, viewing it as a buying opportunity, the price can experience another rally, often exceeding the initial peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:13:00">[12:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:20:00">[12:20:00]</a>.

This concept suggests that market participants themselves produce changes in reality or perception, rather than the stock market merely anticipating events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:48:00">[11:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:51:00">[11:51:00]</a>. For example, a rise in oil prices can modify the fundamentals of related oil service stocks by increasing orders and benefits, which in turn reinforces the perception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:46:00">[12:46:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:48:00">[12:48:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:56:00">[12:56:00]</a>.

However, when a bubble reaches a "new paradigm" where prices are completely disconnected from reality (e.g., the dot-com bubble), even small changes or news can trigger enormous falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:28:00">[13:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:36:00">[13:36:00]</a>. At this point, the fall becomes irreversible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:22:00">[14:22:00]</a>. Even as prices fall, fundamentals may still appear strong due to prior capital flow inertia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:30:00">[14:30:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:35:00">[14:35:00]</a>. This period is particularly dangerous as "bargain hunters" may misinterpret the situation, believing it's a buying opportunity when prices are truly detached from reality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:44:00">[14:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:46:00">[14:46:00]</a>.

### Practical Applications

#### [[Historical financial crises and Soros performance | 2008 Financial Crisis]]
The 2008 crisis serves as a clear example of reflexivity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:21:00">[15:21:00]</a>. After Lehman Brothers' bankruptcy and a significant S&P 500 plummet, the market started to rise in March 2009 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:24:00">[15:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:31:00">[15:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:37:00">[15:37:00]</a>. Despite companies presenting weak results in the first 3-4 quarters of 2009, the market experienced an incredible rally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:04:00">[16:04:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:17:00">[16:17:00]</a>. This highlights that the market didn't anticipate anything but rather that investors' collective perception influenced the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:24:00">[16:24:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:34:00">[16:34:00]</a>. As the S&P began to rise, people regained confidence, leading to new investments, share buybacks by corporations, and central bank liquidity injections, stimulating the economy and restoring credit flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:05:00">[17:05:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:10:00">[17:10:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:13:00">[17:13:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:17:00">[17:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:20:00">[17:20:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:23:00">[17:23:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:31:00">[17:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="17:56:00">[17:56:00]</a>.

#### Spanish REITs (Socimis)
A more recent example is the behavior of Spanish REITs (Socimis) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:09:00">[18:09:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:11:00">[18:11:00]</a>. When they began listing in Spain, housing prices were recovering, but the market was skeptical <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:28:00">[18:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:31:00">[18:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="18:35:00">[18:35:00]</a>. As Socimis started to rise, people perceived them as good investments, causing them to trade at a premium to book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:06:00">[19:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. This allowed them to issue new shares at higher valuations and buy assets in the private market at book value, increasing earnings per share and creating a virtuous circle of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:15:00">[19:15:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:17:00">[19:17:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:21:00">[19:21:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:54:00">[19:54:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:06:00">[20:06:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:41:00">[20:41:00]</a>. Investors perceived them as "growth companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:27:00">[20:27:00]</a>. However, when shares fell (e.g., due to a general market downturn), the Socimis' ability to issue capital at a premium disappeared, potentially leading to a decrease in earnings per share if they raised capital at low prices, marking a dangerous situation for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:57:00">[20:57:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:11:00">[21:11:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:14:00">[21:14:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:37:00">[21:37:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:46:00">[21:46:00]</a>.

## Investment Performance

[[George Soros and the theory of reflexivity | Soros]]'s results are described as spectacular <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:00">[00:26:00]</a>. Since founding his fund in 1970, he has achieved average annual returns of 25% over 45 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>. Importantly, he has not suffered significant losses in almost any major [[historical_financial_crises_and_soros_performance | crisis]] or difficult market year, such as 1987, 1990, the dot-com bubble, 2008, or 2011, often emerging strengthened from these periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:00">[00:36:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:44:00">[00:44:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:00">[00:47:00]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:00">[00:51:00]</a>. His unique approach of doing things differently has allowed him to stand out among great investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>.

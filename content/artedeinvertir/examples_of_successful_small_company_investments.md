Warren Buffett has often highlighted the significant advantage of investing with a small amount of money, suggesting that it allows for much higher annual returns than managing larger sums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>. In a 1999 interview with *BusinessWeek* magazine, Buffett stated he believed he could achieve a 50% annual return if he managed less than a million dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>. He emphasized that this is a "very big structural advantage" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

As an investor's fortune grows, the ability to generate such high returns diminishes due to the limited number of investment opportunities that can absorb large amounts of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Buffett's own returns, for example, have decreased over the years from potentially 50% to around 10% annually with his current level of assets under management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. This highlights the unique [[advantages_of_investing_in_small_companies | advantages of investing in small companies]] for those with less capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>.

## Finding Investment Opportunities

To achieve high returns, investors need to "move a lot of rocks to look for these anomalies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:37">[00:01:37]</a>. This means actively seeking out companies that are "off the map," particularly small, local businesses that are performing well but are overlooked by larger investors and analysts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>.

Warren Buffett advises focusing on [[investment_in_small_caps_and_private_investing | small companies]], also known as small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>. Of the over 30,000 companies listed in the US, only about 500 are included in the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. These larger companies are extensively analyzed, making it difficult to generate returns above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. However, the remaining 29,500 companies offer a fertile ground for finding [[investment opportunities in smallcap stocks | local businesses]] that are not globalized or international, often representing better [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | investment opportunities in undervalued stocks]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### Key Lessons for Investors

*   **Invest Time and Effort:** Opportunities do not simply appear; they require diligent search and investigation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>.
*   **Learn Broadly:** Aspiring investors should learn as much as possible about different businesses and industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>. Success in the stock market is a combination of opportunity and preparation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>.
*   **Scan the Market:** While historical methods involved poring over thick manuals like Moody's, today's investors can use free online resources such as Yahoo Finance or Morningstar.com to research listed companies, their historical sales, profits, and other data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>. Tools called "screens" can also filter stocks based on parameters like low P/E ratios or profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.
*   **Focus on Attractive Industries:** Begin by choosing an attractive industry (e.g., health, IT, technology, transportation) and learning extensively about it, starting with reports from larger companies to understand industry mechanics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. Then, search for smaller, potentially undervalued companies within that sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.
*   **Prioritize Low P/E Ratios:** To generate extraordinary returns, focus on [[investing_in_small_caps_and_undervalued_stocks | investments that are very cheap]], specifically those with very low price-to-earnings (P/E) ratios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. A stock trading at a P/E of two, for example, could theoretically yield a 50% annual return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.

## Case Studies of Successful Investments

### Western Insurance

Warren Buffett himself shared an example of a small, local company he found: Western Insurance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:49">[00:01:49]</a>. This company was trading at $3 a share but was earning $20 a share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. Buffett emphasized the importance of buying "as much as possible" when such opportunities arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:55">[00:01:55]</a>.

### Humanice (True Fund Example)

The True fund, when managing a smaller capital of 9 million euros, successfully invested in Humanice <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:05">[00:03:05]</a>. At the time, Humanice was a micro-company with a market capitalization of just 30 million euros, barely followed by analysts, and largely ignored by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:14">[00:03:14]</a>. It was a good business with low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>.

*   **Valuation:** Humanice was trading at 1.50 euros per share, with projected earnings of 1 euro per share for the following year, resulting in a P/E ratio of less than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:31">[00:03:31]</a>.
*   **Investment Strategy:** The fund bought shares daily for four months, accumulating a position of approximately one million euros at the 1.50 euro price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>.
*   **Returns:** Three years later, those shares were trading at 6 euros per share, quadrupling the initial investment and generating significant profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This success was attributed to being prepared and taking the time to search for opportunities in small or lesser-known companies within a specific sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>.

### Korean Stocks (2004)

Around 2004, a friend gave Warren Buffett a book on Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>. Despite initial hesitation, Buffett spent five or six hours scanning the book for cheap stocks and found several interesting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. He decided to invest $100 million, divided among 20 of these Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:16">[00:09:16]</a>.

*   **Daegu Flour:** One example was Daegu Flour, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. Its earnings per share had been consistently strong, and it held 100,000 won per share in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.
*   **Valuation & Returns:** The stock was trading at 38,000 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:45">[00:09:45]</a>. Buffett famously commented, "You have to make money buying stocks like this at twice the profits" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. The stock quickly appreciated to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his investment by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:01">[00:10:01]</a>.

These [[case_studies_of_successful_and_challenging_investments | case studies of successful and challenging investments]] demonstrate that opportunities for significant returns in small companies have always existed and will continue to exist in the markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>. Success requires "illusion, passion, the curiosity necessary," hard work, and a willingness to do things differently from other investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:25">[00:10:25]</a>.

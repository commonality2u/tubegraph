The declining value of the dollar, accelerated by decisions of central banks and governments, prompts a need for investors to protect their capital and savings from devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Influential investors like Ray Dalio, who manages the world's largest investment fund, have stated the dollar will lose value and are selling the currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. The dollar's status as the global foreign exchange reserve means its devaluation will affect economies and [[investment_opportunities_in the stock market | stock markets]] worldwide, even for those who don't directly hold dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

In 2020 alone, 22% of the total dollars in circulation were created, a significant increase for a currency with 200 years of history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. This has led to the dollar devaluing over 10% against the Euro in just nine months since the crisis began <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>.

Central banks globally, including those managing the Euro and Pound, are replicating the US's increased money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:32">[00:06:32]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This means money held in fixed terms or not invested will likely lose value due to [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>. [[investment_opportunities_in_traditional_companies | Fixed income]] or bonds are also significantly impacted by rising inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:52">[00:06:52]</a>.

## Strategies for Protecting Capital

### [[Gold as a Safe Investment in Uncertain Times | Investing in Gold]]

[[Gold as a Safe Investment in Uncertain Times | Gold]] is considered a currency that cannot be created out of thin air, unlike fiat currencies such as the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. When the dollar devalues, the price of gold, which is denominated in dollars, tends to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:23">[00:08:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>.

Notable investors are turning to gold:
*   Ray Dalio is investing in [[Gold as a Safe Investment in Uncertain Times | gold]] and inflation-protected bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:17">[00:05:17]</a>.
*   Stanley Druckenmiller is aggressively selling dollars and investing in [[Gold as a Safe Investment in Uncertain Times | gold]] and mining companies that will benefit from increased [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:19">[00:06:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>.

#### How to Invest in Gold

Investing in physical gold used to involve storage and security costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:39">[00:08:39]</a>. However, [[investment_opportunities_in the stock market | the stock market]] offers ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that buy physical gold on your behalf and store it safely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

Examples of Gold ETFs:
*   **iShares Physical Gold ETF (EGLN)**: Listed on the London Stock Exchange, it has appreciated over 40% in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">[00:09:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:11">[00:09:11]</a>.
*   **SPDR Gold Shares (GLD)**: Listed in the US, it has also shown good performance over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:23">[00:09:23]</a>.

### Investing in Non-US Stocks

Investing in stocks outside the US is a way to protect against dollar devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. If US-denominated stocks are held and the dollar devalues, any gains from stock appreciation could be lost due to the currency factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

Ray Dalio has invested in an emerging markets ETF that invests in stocks of countries outside the US that are less indebted and do not need to print currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:33">[00:10:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:36">[00:10:36]</a>. This ETF, listed under the ticker EMM, has performed well in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:44">[00:10:44]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>.

Another strategy is to invest in large US exporting companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>. These companies sell products abroad, receive more valuable foreign currency, while their costs remain denominated in the devalued dollar. This automatically increases their income or earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:16">[00:11:16]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

#### Practical Examples of Exporting Companies

Historically, companies that export significantly benefit from currency devaluation. For example, after the 2016 Brexit vote, the British Pound plummeted, but large exporting companies in the UK saw "stupendous revaluations" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:46">[00:11:46]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

*   **Rolls Royce (UK)**: Appreciated over 30% in just a few weeks after the Pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:16">[00:12:16]</a>.
*   **GlaxoSmithKline (UK)**: Rose over 20% in the [[investment_opportunities_in the stock market | stock market]] immediately after the Pound's devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:23">[00:12:23]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:28">[00:12:28]</a>.

Companies producing [[investment_opportunities in raw materials and commodities | raw materials]] also offer a defense, as their product prices often rise when the dollar devalues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:33">[00:13:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>.

*   **ExxonMobil (XOM)**: The world's largest oil company, listed in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>. It meets two conditions for protection against currency devaluation:
    *   Produces [[investment_opportunities in raw materials and commodities | raw materials]] (oil), so if the dollar devalues, oil prices tend to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:38">[00:13:38]</a>.
    *   Exports more than half of its products outside the US (only 35% of production is sold in the US) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:45">[00:13:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">[00:14:31]</a>.
    *   *Valuation*: Currently trading at $38, down from $80 due to low oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:43">[00:14:43]</a>. Historically, with oil at $50-$65, Exxon earns around $4 per share and pays a $3 dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:13">[00:15:13]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. At its historical valuation of 15 times earnings, its target value could be $60 per share in 2-3 years, plus over $6 in dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:35">[00:15:35]</a>. Based on its historical 4% dividend yield, a $3 annual dividend could imply a target value of $75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

*   **Pfizer (PFE)**: A leading biotechnology company listed in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:06">[00:17:06]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:01">[00:17:01]</a>. Warren Buffett has invested over $135 million in Pfizer shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:11">[00:17:11]</a>. More than 50% of its sales are outside the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:57">[00:17:57]</a>. Pfizer has high ROEs (consistently above 20%) and low debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:03">[00:18:03]</a>.
    *   *Valuation*: Pfizer expects to earn around $3 in earnings per share this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. The biotechnology sector typically trades at 18 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:37">[00:18:37]</a>. Multiplying $3 by 18 suggests a target value of $54 per share for next year, compared to its current trading price of $38 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>. The company also has growth potential and an interesting dividend <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:56">[00:18:56]</a>.

#### Finding Export Data for Companies

To find the percentage of sales exported by a company:
1.  **Official Annual Report**: Look for the breakdown of sales by region or country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>.
2.  **Financial Websites**: Websites like marketscreener.com process this information and present it clearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. On marketscreener.com, search by company name or ticker, go to the 'Company' tab, scroll down to 'Sales by Region' <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:22">[00:14:22]</a>.

Other large US exporting companies that may be worth considering include Apple, Johnson & Johnson, Intel, and Procter & Gamble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>.

These strategies provide ways to protect capital and savings from the accelerated devaluation of currencies.

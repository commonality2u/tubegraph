## Ray Dalio's Market Outlook and Risks
Ray Dalio and his Bridgewater team anticipate a new risk for the stock market in September, potentially leading to an additional 20-25% drop [00:00:11]. This prediction is based on the expected withdrawal of stimulus measures [00:03:30]. Dalio believes the market is currently underestimating the persistence of inflation and the likelihood of a recession [00:02:49]. He states that asset prices clearly need to decline [00:03:17] and has been reducing Bridgewater's weight in stocks, rotating towards safer portfolios [00:03:22].

### Three Major Market Risks
According to Dalio, three primary risks will interlink over the next 6-12 months [00:03:57]:
1.  **Pressure from Multiples**: The S&P 500's price-to-earnings multiple has fallen from 24x to around 17x [00:04:05]. While it reached 14x in June/July, the current multiple is near its historical average, which typically aligns with 5-6% interest rates [00:04:15].
2.  **Drop in Profits (Recession)**: A 10-20% drop in corporate profits, typical during a recession, would artificially increase the multiple and negatively impact stocks [00:04:30]. This risk is not yet fully priced into the market [00:06:19].
3.  **Liquidity in the System**: Easy and abundant money encourages investment and business confidence [00:04:55]. This is closely tied to interest rates and quantitative tightening (QT) [00:05:01].

> Raising rates too quickly can lead to a recession, causing profits to drop [00:05:20]. Conversely, not raising rates aggressively enough fails to control inflation [00:05:31]. It is highly likely that at least two of these three risks will materialize [00:05:39].

### Quantitative Tightening (QT)
Quantitative Tightening (QT) is the opposite of quantitative easing (QE), which involves printing money [00:06:40]. Central banks, like the Federal Reserve (Fed) and the European Central Bank (ECB), have two main tools: printing/withdrawing money and setting interest rates [00:06:47]. While recent market drops have been influenced by interest rate hikes, September marks the full implementation of QT, with a monthly withdrawal of $95 billion [00:08:15]. This translates to almost a trillion dollars annually being withdrawn from the system, a reversal of the large amounts printed during the 2020 crisis [00:08:35]. Historically, periods of money withdrawal (red line on Fed balance charts) correlate with worse market performance [00:09:07]. The Fed projects reducing its balance sheet to pre-pandemic levels [01:02:03].

### September Market Tendency
Historically, September is often the worst month for the stock market, with prices tending to drop the most [01:12:24]. This phenomenon is attributed to a psychological factor, as people return from vacation and may feel more depressed [01:12:33]. Conversely, October, November, December, January, February, March, and April are typically among the best months for investing [01:13:03].

### Ray Dalio's Advice for Investors
Dalio advises that it's impossible to completely avoid the anticipated market fall, as it will affect everyone [01:13:50]. His recommendations include [01:13:58]:
*   **Reduce risks**.
*   **Diversify globally** at the asset level (e.g., bonds, quality stocks) [01:14:06].
*   **Hold quality stocks** or non-cyclical companies with low debt [01:14:12].
*   **Diversify sectorally**, avoiding sectors highly sensitive to the economic cycle or profit drops (e.g., automobile, banks, insurance, construction, transportation, raw materials, energy, unless in specific situations) [01:14:21]. Gold is not historically a safe haven in such scenarios [01:15:05].

## General [[investment_strategies_and_advice | Investment Strategies and Advice]]
### Market Valuations and Opportunities
Despite current complexities, European market valuations have reached levels similar to the 2020 confinement, and individual stock valuations have significantly dropped, presenting future opportunities [02:11:13]. The worse the market situation, the quicker it tends to rebound [02:14:46].

> [!CAUTION] The Importance of Training
> Rapid market increases mean that being prepared through training is crucial to capitalize on opportunities [02:15:54]. The focus is currently on inflation and energy prices, but these problems tend to be solved, leading to a turnaround [02:21:08]. When stock valuations are well below historical averages, rapid recoveries can occur [02:22:50].

### Investor Sentiment
Consumer and investor negativity is significant, with only 40% expecting stock prices to rise in the next year [02:19:50]. However, historically, stocks rise over 90-95% of the time over 10-15 year periods [02:20:07]. While capital outflows are occurring, they are not as aggressive as in 2008 [02:20:34]. Low expectations and low stock exposure in portfolios often indicate good times to invest [02:20:46].

### Key Factors for Stock Performance
Stock market performance is influenced by three main factors [02:26:46]:
1.  **Multiples**: Driven by investor psychology and sentiment [02:26:51].
2.  **Profits**: Dependent on the general economic level [02:26:54].
3.  **Liquidity**: Significant impact over 6-24 month periods [02:27:00].

### Learning from Experience
It's crucial to learn from professionals who have demonstrated their ability to generate returns [02:28:57]. Learning to invest involves understanding the future earnings potential of a company (5-10 years out), identifying strong competitive advantages, market growth, and competent management [02:33:06]. Errors in precise valuation calculations (e.g., 14.5x vs. 13.7x earnings) are less impactful than intangible factors requiring experience [02:33:47].

## [[Investment strategies of famous investors like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett | Investment Strategies of François Rosón]]
François Rosón, a Canadian fund manager, is highlighted for his long-term success, achieving 16% net annual returns over 30 years with Giverny Capital [03:30:37]. His style is considered replicable for individual investors [03:30:50].

### Rosón's Investment Philosophy
*   **Long-Only & Long-Term**: Invests only for the long term, expecting shares to perform without using shorting or derivatives [03:33:09].
*   **Diversified Portfolio**: Holds 15-25 companies [03:33:41].
*   **Focus on Quality**: Prefers quality companies with consistent growth and profitability, avoiding unproven, loss-making, or highly speculative ventures [03:34:00].
*   **Reasonable Multiples**: Aims to pay reasonable multiples for good businesses, understanding that a 30x or 40x P/E can be cheap if the company grows 30% annually [04:47:50].
*   **Predicting Future Value**: Estimates the increase in a company's value based on profit growth, share buybacks, and dividends [03:52:00]. This is the most important component [03:53:06].
*   **Learning from Mistakes**: Acknowledges "errors of omission" – not buying something that later performs well due to perceived high valuation [04:18:20].

### Rosón's Portfolio Examples
Rosón's portfolio consists of high-quality companies, including well-known names from the US like Disney and Google [04:21:08].

1.  **Five Below (FIVE)**: A discount retail chain selling branded products and impulse items under $5 [05:52:08]. Its competitive advantage stems from its business model (driving traffic with cheap branded items and making money on impulse buys) and scale, which makes online competition difficult due to shipping costs [05:55:54]. The company's earnings per share have grown from $1 in 2015 to $5 currently [05:56:40].
    *   **General Advice**: Look for companies with strong historical performance, competitive advantages, good management, and reasonable valuations [05:57:07]. The sector itself (discount retail) is resilient to crises [05:59:58].

2.  **Progressive Corporation (PGR)**: A low-cost auto insurer [06:07:05]. In the insurance sector, the key competitive advantage is having the lowest costs [06:10:10]. Progressive and Geico (100% owned by [[Investment strategies of famous investors like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]]) are gaining market share from larger, less efficient insurers [06:07:51]. Insurers benefit from "float" – premiums paid in advance that can be invested, generating additional profits [06:08:12]. This sector is non-cyclical, as car insurance is mandatory, and low-cost providers can even gain customers during crises [06:09:16].

3.  **Carmax (KMX)**: A used car retailer that professionalized the sector in the US by offering fixed, fair prices and transparency [06:17:59]. Its competitive advantages include scale and brand trust [06:19:14]. Carmax grows by capturing market share in a mature but gigantic market [06:19:39]. Despite economic crises (like 2008 where shares fell 70%), staying invested yielded significant returns [06:21:35]. The stock typically trades between 15-20 times earnings [06:25:19].

## General Investment Principles
*   **No Stop-Loss Orders**: Successful investors like François Rosón, [[Investment strategies of famous investors like Ray Dalio and Warren Buffett | Warren Buffett]], and Ray Dalio do not use stop-loss orders, considering them speculative tools that don't account for market gaps or fundamental changes [07:05:05].
*   **Focus on Business Quality**: Prioritize companies that are well-managed, have strong competitive advantages, and operate in favorable sectors, even if their valuations seem slightly higher [07:08:48]. Avoid companies with pyramid sales models or unsustainable growth (e.g., Herbalife) [07:33:25].
*   **Long-Term Perspective**: The stock market is not a casino; long-term performance is determined by a company's fundamentals and future earnings [07:44:15]. Even if a stock price drops, if the fundamentals remain strong, it represents a better value [07:48:00].
*   **Continuous Learning**: Investors are constantly learning and improving [07:50:00]. Reading good books and seeking quality training are important for developing investment skills [07:57:00].
*   **Market Dynamics**: Understanding how factors like multiples, profits, and liquidity interact is key to navigating market volatility [08:39:50].

> [!NOTE] Practical Application
> The goal is to learn the method of [[analysis_of_investment_strategies_for_private_investors | investment analysis]] and apply it to one's own decisions, rather than blindly copying specific stock picks [08:52:06]. This involves studying companies, understanding their business models, competitive sales, and risk factors [08:52:06].

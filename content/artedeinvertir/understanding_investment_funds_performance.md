From: [[artedeinvertir]] <br/> 

[[investment_funds_and_asset_management | Investment funds]] have been a significant area of focus due to their growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>. The speaker, who manages these funds, is limited to investing in stocks or, at most, some bonds, and cannot invest in Bitcoin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a>.

## Fund Performance and Growth
The "trialism the cap" fund, a small-cap fund, has shown robust growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>.
*   **Recent Returns**: It achieved a 23% return in the first three months of the current year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:45">[00:04:45]</a>.
*   **Capital Inflow**: The fund started less than a year ago with a minimum of three million euros and has since grown to 33 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:51">[00:04:51]</a>.
*   **Past Performance**: The fund also performed unexpectedly well last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Another fund, "True Capital," which invests in larger, more stable shares, includes holdings like Johnson & Johnson, Alibaba, AutoZone, Facebook, Google, and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:12">[00:37:12]</a>.

### Managing Fund Capacity
A preferred share class (Class B) with a lower commission of 0.95% was intended to close upon reaching 30 million euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:19">[00:05:19]</a>. Due to the time required for formal closure with the CNMV, this opportunity remained available even as the fund quickly surpassed 30 million euros, reaching 33 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>.

### Investment Philosophy for Funds
The primary occupation of the speaker is investing through these [[investment_funds_and_asset_management | funds]], with YouTube and training courses filling their free time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:10">[00:22:10]</a>. The fund management aims to have a "down 6 very here" approach, minimizing potential losses while seeking good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:42">[02:06:42]</a>. They have not experienced significant losses (e.g., 60-90%) in their [[investment_funds_and_asset_management | investment funds]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:02">[02:07:02]</a>.

## Investment Strategy and Risk Management
The speaker's [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investment philosophy]] emphasizes avoiding panic and maintaining a portfolio of sound investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:51">[00:51:51]</a>.
*   **Core Principles**: Invest in companies that are understandable, debt-free, and not excessively valued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:25">[00:52:25]</a>.
*   **Long-term View**: A single year in the stock market is considered short-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. Over three years, rationality tends to prevail, and good, cheap, well-performing companies are likely to yield positive experiences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:12">[01:01:12]</a>.
*   **Rebalancing**: Rebalancing based on short-term market fluctuations is discouraged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:22">[01:01:22]</a>. Instead, maintain a solid, defined [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investment style]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:37">[01:01:37]</a>.

A key aspect of their [[understanding_and_managing_investment_portfolios | investment portfolio]] management is to always maintain some liquidity and avoid excessive leverage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. When the market falls, the advice is not to panic, as solid businesses that generate profits and are not overvalued will eventually recover <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Market declines, which typically last months or a year or two, can even present opportunities to buy more shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>.

During market downturns, the strategy involves selling shares that may have fallen but no longer offer the best opportunity, and reallocating to other shares that present better prospects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:50">[00:09:50]</a>. This process has historically led the fund to new highs after market rebounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:17">[01:01:17]</a>.

### Market Conditions and Stock Performance
*   **Current Outlook**: The speaker provides information on current market conditions, noting that no one has a "magic ball" to predict future events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:23">[00:06:23]</a>.
*   **Capital Inflows/Outflows**: Global stock markets have seen accumulated capital inflows of $400 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:58">[00:06:58]</a>. This indicator is usually countercyclical; large inflows may precede corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Historically, corrections of 8-10% occur yearly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>. There has never been such a rebound and euphoria in the stock market as seen from 2003-2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:26">[00:08:26]</a>.
*   **Interest Rates and Inflation**:
    *   The 10-year US bond is considered the safest asset and the benchmark for almost any global investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
    *   Rising bond yields (e.g., from 0.5% to 1.6%) make other investments less attractive, leading to stock market adjustments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:51">[00:11:51]</a>.
    *   Interest rates, influenced by central banks, are the most significant factor affecting stock markets, more so than politics or trade wars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.
    *   High money supply and consumer desire to spend are leading to expectations of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:00">[01:16:00]</a>.
    *   Rising bond yields and raw material prices (e.g., copper, oil) are key indicators of inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:16">[01:16:16]</a>.
    *   Inflation forces central banks to raise interest rates, which is generally not positive for growth stocks but benefits value stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:45">[01:16:45]</a>.
    *   Despite media narratives, rising interest rates do not always lead to market declines; historical data shows varied outcomes, with value and growth stocks often compensating each other <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>.

## Fund Holdings and Specific Stock Analysis
The speaker discusses several companies held in the funds or frequently asked about:

*   **Berkshire Hathaway**: Valued by its price-to-book value, it typically trades around 1.4 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:45">[02:26:45]</a>. Warren Buffett considers it cheap at 1.2 times book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:50">[02:26:50]</a>. The funds first invested in 2016 and again during the pandemic when it was very cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:11">[02:27:11]</a>.
*   **Nvidia**: An excellent stock with demanding but reasonable valuation due to high growth estimates (52% in 2021, 32% in next 12 months) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:40">[02:29:40]</a>. It trades at 30 times forward earnings and has expanded profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:30:02">[02:30:02]</a>.
*   **Carnival Corporation (Cruise Ships)**: Was very cheap at $12, but is less so now. Future earnings per share are reduced due to new share issuance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:32:03">[02:32:03]</a>.
*   **Spirit Airlines**: A low-cost airline with a solvent financial position. It recovered to pre-pandemic levels, demonstrating the resilience of good, solvent companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:33:07">[02:33:07]</a>.
*   **AerCap (AER)**: An airline leasing company that recovered significantly after a deep drop during the pandemic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:15">[02:34:15]</a>. It recently merged with a rival, increasing its book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:34">[02:34:34]</a>.
*   **Alibaba**: Held in one of the funds, considered attractive due to its valuation and expected doubling of profitability and income in the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:38:52">[02:38:52]</a>. It trades at an adjusted 15-17 times earnings, below market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:13">[02:46:13]</a>.
*   **Sprouts Farmers Market (SFM)**: A company in the growing organic food sector, found to be surprisingly cheap despite Amazon's acquisition of its main rival, Whole Foods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:41:35">[02:41:35]</a>. The company has consistent growth and actively buys back shares, indicating management's confidence in its undervaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:56">[02:43:56]</a>.
*   **Lockheed Martin / Northrop Grumman (Defense Stocks)**: Considered "value shares" that are more ignored by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:49:52">[02:49:52]</a>. They offer good prospects with reasonable P/E ratios and dividends, making them defensive actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:06">[02:50:06]</a>.
*   **ITT**: A holding company with a stable business and other divisions, one of the main positions in the Trujal smallcaps fund <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:37">[02:53:37]</a>. It has generated value through spin-offs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:06">[02:55:06]</a>.
*   **Amazon**: Funds have been increasing positions. Expected to continue growing due to e-commerce expansion and margin increases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:08">[02:59:08]</a>. Valued by free cash flow or EBITDA multiples, it's considered attractive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:43">[02:59:43]</a>.
*   **Google**: A top position in the original fund, exhibiting strong results and benefiting from increased online advertising <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:55">[03:02:55]</a>.
*   **Facebook**: Also held in the funds, showing strong earnings per share growth and significant cash flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:58">[03:09:58]</a>.
*   **Airbus / Boeing**: Benefit from economic reopening. Airbus, for example, is expected to return to previous levels but with limited upside compared to other opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:00">[03:10:00]</a>.
*   **Philip Morris / Altria**: Consumer companies considered cheap despite being "ignored" by some segments of the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:53">[03:14:53]</a>.
*   **Porsche**: Buying Porsche is like buying Volkswagen at a discount, as Porsche is the largest shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:00">[03:08:00]</a>. It's a cyclical, cheap stock, contrasting with expensive Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:08:11">[03:08:11]</a>.
*   **Repsol**: An oil company, performing well now due to rising oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:30">[03:11:30]</a>. While it can offer short- to medium-term speculation opportunities during oil price drops, it doesn't offer long-term value generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:59">[03:13:59]</a>.
*   **Autodesk**: A design software company with strong competitive advantages, transitioning to cloud products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:18">[03:22:18]</a>. Its valuation is demanding but not bubble-like, relying on continued 15% annual growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:52">[03:22:52]</a>.
*   **Humanice**: A main position in the aggressive small-cap fund, acquired other companies, increasing its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:27:07">[03:27:07]</a>.
*   **AmRest Holdings (EMT)**: A restaurant company, valued at less than 10 times earnings despite having clear growth prospects (10-15% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:28:52">[03:28:52]</a>.

### Special Purpose Acquisition Companies (SPACs)
There has been a recent "euphoria" around SPACs, with their numbers shooting up significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>. SPACs are empty shells used as a mechanism to go public with less regulatory scrutiny <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:07">[03:37:07]</a>. While they can be serious, they are often used by opportunists to list companies of "dubious reputation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:37:51">[03:37:51]</a>. Investors should be cautious, as many listed SPACs are "pumped up" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:40:33">[03:40:33]</a>. The funds have invested in one serious SPAC promoted by Sir Martin Franklin, which has a real business in fire protection systems and building maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:52">[03:59:52]</a>.

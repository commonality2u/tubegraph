[[lessons_from_historical_stock_market_crises | Economic crises]] and cycles are an inherent part of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>. Legendary investor Warren Buffett has historically capitalized on these downturns, making some of his most successful investments by exercising prudence just before the onset of major [[challenges_of_economic_recession | economic crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>. A significant part of his success also stems from his courage to invest when pessimism is prevalent and his belief in the long-term [[economic_indicators_and_their_impact_on_stock_markets | economic future]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Historical Warnings

Warren Buffett, often called the "Oracle of Omaha" for his ability to foresee economic and investment events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>, has rarely issued specific warning messages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. In 50 years, he has only twice before taken drastic measures, such as rapidly selling stocks and cautioning investors, leading to significant market and economic setbacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:00">[02:12:00]</a>, where the market fell by more than 40% and the economy faced a major [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:23:00">[02:23:00]</a>. We are now witnessing his third such warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:00">[00:33:00]</a>.

### First Warning (Early Career)

At the beginning of his career as an investment fund manager, after 13 years of highly successful performance with annual returns exceeding 30%, Warren Buffett declared that the economy faced significant challenges and that [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market valuations]] were very expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:31:00">[02:31:00]</a>. Despite a widespread belief that the [[stock_market_rally_amidst_economic_contraction | stock market]] would continue to rise and a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] was impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>, Buffett accumulated cash and eventually returned all money to his investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:04:00">[03:04:00]</a>.

Shortly after these measures:
*   The [[stock_market_fluctuations and potential_crisis | stock market fell]] by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:16:00">[03:16:00]</a>.
*   Over the next four years, it accumulated declines of nearly 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:19:00">[03:19:00]</a>.
*   The economy eventually entered a major [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:25:00">[03:25:00]</a>.

### Second Warning (1999 - Dot-Com Bubble)

Approximately 30 years after his initial warning, in 1999, Buffett took similar actions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:29:00">[03:29:00]</a>. He warned of "enormous euphoria" in the [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]], unsustainable valuations, and significant [[current_economic_risks_and_their_impact_on_the_stock_market | economic challenges]] ahead <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>. Optimism was widespread, and the economy had experienced one of its longest cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:42:00">[03:42:00]</a>, with [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market valuations]] remaining very high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.

Six months after his warning:
*   The internet bubble burst <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.
*   Major [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stock markets plummeted]] by over 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:59:00">[03:59:00]</a>.
*   The Nasdaq technology index fell by more than 75% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>.
*   The US and European economies entered a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] 12 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>.

### Third Warning (Current Period)

Twenty-five years later, Buffett has issued his third warning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. He is reportedly preparing for a [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | financial crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a> and is rapidly selling stocks to build a cash cushion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:00">[00:38:00]</a>.

Reasons for this cautious outlook include:
*   Current tariff problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:58:00">[07:58:00]</a>.
*   Conflicts between China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:01:00">[08:01:00]</a>.
*   Speculation in financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.
*   Inflation problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.
*   High [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | valuations]] of most stocks relative to the risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:17:00">[08:17:00]</a>.

### Sectors Impacted by Recession

Historically, the financial, real estate, technology, and industrial sectors are among the most affected during a potential [[challenges_of_economic_recession | crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:53:00">[05:53:00]</a>. Warren Buffett's recent sales have focused on reducing exposure to the financial and banking sectors, including historic holdings like Bank of America and Wells Fargo <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:00">[05:27:00]</a>. He has also sold real estate companies and no longer holds industrial sector companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:16:00">[06:16:00]</a>. Conversely, the energy sector has shown to be one of the least affected during a potential [[impact_of_recession_on_stock_market_and_investments | economic recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:33:00">[06:33:00]</a>, with Buffett expanding his positions in energy and oil companies like Chevron and Occidental Petroleum <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>.

## Current Market Valuations and Future Outlook

A JP Morgan study suggests that the higher the starting valuation of the [[stock_market_trends_and_opportunities_during_economic_uncertainty | stock market]], the lower the future performance over the next 10 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:03:00">[09:03:00]</a>. Currently, the expected return for the S&P 500 is very low, potentially below 5% or even 0% per year, due to high valuations ranging between 19 and 22 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:19:00">[09:19:00]</a>. Warren Buffett believes the [[stock_market_rally_amidst_economic_contraction | stock market]] is expensive because it trades at 20 times earnings, compared to an average of 16 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:06:00">[13:06:00]</a>.

Buffett's investment strategy historically involves rarely paying more than 15 times earnings when initiating a position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:31:00">[13:31:00]</a>. He prefers to maintain liquidity and await better opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:09:00">[10:09:00]</a>.

While crises are inevitable, they should be viewed as opportunities for making good investments with a long-term vision <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="15:40:00">[15:40:00]</a>.

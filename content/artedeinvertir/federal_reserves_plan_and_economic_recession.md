Members of the [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy | Federal Reserve]] have indicated that the next [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] is "practically imminent" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. This article explores the Fed's perspective, its actions, and potential repercussions on financial markets and daily life <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>.

## Fed's Stance on Recession and Inflation
Mr. Filla un Powel recently commented in Congress that recessions are "certainly a possibility" and that the Fed is "tremendously committed to combating inflation" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>. Big Dad Ley, a former president of the [[federal_reserves_impact_on_the_economy | Federal Reserve]] in New York, stated that a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] is inevitable in the next six months of 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. He believes this is because [[central_bank_forecasts_and_economic_recession | central banks]] must act on inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>.

According to Mr. Filla un Powel, achieving the goal of reducing inflation without causing a crisis will be "very difficult" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:57">[00:05:57]</a>. He also highlighted dependence on external factors not controlled by the Fed, such as oil prices, which significantly contribute to current inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. The Fed does not control oil prices, politicians, or oil companies' decisions regarding extraction or supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.

## Economic Indicators and Recession Warnings
The President of the Fed of Atlanta published preliminary data estimating that the growth of the American GDP in the second quarter may be around 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:07">[00:07:07]</a>. Given that the first quarter was already negative, two consecutive quarters of decline would officially constitute a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>.

Historically, bullish cycles of interest rate hikes by the Fed have always ended with some negative economic or financial event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>:
*   **1998:** The rate hike cycle coincided with Russia's bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.
*   **2000:** Rate hikes ended the dot-com bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.
*   **2008:** The subprime crisis followed rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>.
*   **1994:** Emerging countries collapsed due to rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">[00:08:12]</a>.
*   **1987:** Also coincided with rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>.

Michael Moore previously warned about the subprime bubble in 2005-2006 and inflation a year prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. He also warned about Bitcoin, and its recent performance validated his concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>. He compares the current situation to 2008, stating "it's like watching a plane crash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Market Sentiment and Liquidity
The average drop in the S&P 500 without a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] is typically 21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>. If a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] occurs, the average fall is 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. The probability of a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] in the next 12 months, according to investment banks, is between 75% and 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:17">[00:09:17]</a>.

A determining factor in markets is liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>. The total money supply globally has shown a high correlation with the S&P 500 over a decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. When money circulation is restricted, the market tends to move sideways <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:19">[00:12:19]</a>. The blue line indicating liquidity has been descending since January, correlating with the market's descent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>.

The Fed uses its reverse repurchase agreement (reverse repo) facility to control inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>. Banks and institutions can deposit money with the Fed to earn rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>. When the Fed raises rates, it drains money from the market, reducing investments and economic activity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:15">[00:15:15]</a>. Money deposited in reverse repos has skyrocketed to two trillion dollars, effectively draining significant liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. Many anticipate the Fed may cut rates if a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] is foreseen, to return this money to the economy and financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:58">[00:16:58]</a>.

The correlation between stocks in the S&P 500 is currently high (around 0.5), similar to 2018 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:43">[00:18:43]</a>. This indicates that people are buying and selling based on fear or perceived opportunity rather than individual stock fundamentals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:01">[00:18:01]</a>. Bearish investor sentiment is at its highest, reaching 2008 levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>. This very negative market sentiment, while concerning, can be a "good breeding ground for the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:01">[00:19:01]</a>.

## Inflation Dynamics
Current inflation is attributed to two main factors:
*   **Bottlenecks and Supply Disruptions:** Representing 4 points of the current 7% inflation, caused by COVID-19 lockdowns and the subsequent unexpected rapid economic recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">[00:23:31]</a>.
*   **Excess Demand:** Currently at 2% growth, above the usual average of 1% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:28">[00:24:28]</a>.

If these factors moderate, inflation could potentially align with the Fed's goal of 2-3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:50">[00:24:50]</a>. Companies are reporting that the "worst of the inflation in commodities seems to be already in the rearview mirror" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>. Copper, a key economic indicator, has seen significant declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:05">[00:21:05]</a>. Steel prices have plummeted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>. Oil, previously the last commodity holding up, is now falling, reaching $105-$110 from $120 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:23">[00:21:23]</a>. Shipping costs from China to the US have halved in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:00">[00:22:00]</a>. These declines suggest inflation may moderate or slow down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities Amidst Downturns
While a [[challenges_of_economic_recession | recession]] presents challenges, historical data indicates that after "massive falls in the markets, investments are when it is safest to invest" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:13">[00:26:13]</a>. Returns three and five years after major market falls and recessions have always been positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:05">[00:26:05]</a>, sometimes yielding returns of 200-300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:57">[00:34:57]</a>.

The average bear market lasts 14 months, with an average drop of 33% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:04">[00:27:04]</a>. In contrast, bullish cycles last much longer, averaging 70 months with returns of almost 300% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:21">[00:27:21]</a>. Investors are advised to focus on the long term and evaluate investments based on a three-to-five-year horizon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:52">[00:10:52]</a>.

During interest rate hikes, financial services companies and banks tend to perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>. Companies with low debt and those that reinvest significantly in their business tend to recover more than the market during recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:44">[00:29:44]</a>.

The S&P 500 currently offers a profitability of 6.5% (trading at roughly 15 times earnings), which is below its historical average. However, the additional profitability over the 10-year bond is at one of its highest moments, similar to favorable investment periods in the late 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:57">[00:32:57]</a>.

The number of shares trading at very low multiples (e.g., three times operating profits) has significantly increased, indicating potential opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:25">[00:37:25]</a>. In times of panic or [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recessions]], there are paradoxically more cheap shares available <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:52">[00:37:52]</a>.

### Recommended Stocks and Sector Analysis
JP Morgan's top picks for 2022 include:
*   **Fiserv (FISV):** A financial services company that historically performs well when interest rates rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:21">[00:43:21]</a>. It has a competitive advantage as an oligopoly in credit card processing, allowing it to raise prices more than costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:00">[00:45:00]</a>. It increased profits during the 2008-2010 crisis and actively bought back shares when they were undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:37">[00:47:37]</a>. Its current valuation is below its historical average, partly due to competition from new technology companies like Stripe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:35">[00:50:35]</a>.
*   **Bank of America (BAC):** A major US bank that benefits from rising interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:30">[00:53:30]</a>. A 1% increase in rates can boost its profit by $6 billion, potentially $12 billion with a 2% rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:06">[00:54:06]</a>. Its valuation is currently at its lowest since the 2008 crisis, only slightly above the March 2020 lows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:30">[00:55:30]</a>.
*   **Lennar (LEN):** A leading home builder, a cyclical sector prone to market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:19">[00:57:19]</a>. It is currently trading at a low valuation of 5 times earnings due to fears of rising mortgage rates impacting house prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:37">[00:57:37]</a>. However, the US population growth creates ongoing demand for new homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:42">[01:01:42]</a>, and current housing inventories are near the historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>.

Other companies discussed:
*   **Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ):** One of Canada's top oil companies, benefiting from high oil prices but now correcting due to expectations of calming inflation and falling oil demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:25:01">[01:25:01]</a>.
*   **StoneCo (STNE):** A Brazilian payment processing company that has seen its growth slow and margins decrease due to increased competition from traditional banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:30">[01:07:30]</a>.
*   **Zendesk (ZEN):** A cloud software company with a high valuation (90 times earnings) despite a significant drop from its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:08">[01:19:08]</a>.
*   **Berkshire Hathaway (BRK.B):** Warren Buffett's company, which started the year well but saw its stock decline due to changing market sentiment and Buffett's cautious outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:29">[01:21:29]</a>. It is currently trading at a valuation that Buffett considers undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:22:00">[01:22:00]</a>.

## Conclusion: Adapting and Investing
The market is currently experiencing significant volatility, but it is important to understand that market downturns are a normal part of the investment cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:33:17">[01:33:17]</a>. High correlations between stocks indicate that market sentiment is driven by fear, which paradoxically creates opportunities for discerning investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:01">[01:18:01]</a>.

Investing in a bear market requires a philosophical approach to volatility and a focus on the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:56">[01:00:56]</a>. The key is to select quality companies with low debt, strong competitive advantages, and the ability to grow profits even during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:59:59">[02:59:59]</a>. By understanding the underlying economic dynamics and stock market history, investors can navigate the current environment and position themselves for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

[[common_scams_in_stock_market_investments | Dangerous scams]] in the stock market and investments include the use of trading robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. These scams have become more prevalent as the world of stock market investments has gained popularity, attracting unscrupulous individuals who seek to profit from others' money through complex deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. It is crucial for investors to understand these techniques to avoid them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## What is a Trading Robot Scam?

A trading robot scam typically offers a computer program or algorithm that supposedly operates automatically and generates consistent profits in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:04">[00:07:04]</a>.

### How it Works

Scammers usually "embellish" this scam with various forms of evidence, such as:
*   Screenshots of bank statements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:15">[00:07:15]</a>.
*   Real-time trading displays of the supposed computer program's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:17">[00:07:17]</a>.

## The Fundamental Flaw

The core problem with these scams lies in a basic question: Why would anyone offer such a powerful tool, capable of generating money automatically without effort, for a negligible amount, typically less than ten thousand dollars? <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:24">[00:07:24]</a>.

## The Reality of Algorithmic Trading

Genuine algorithms capable of producing profits in nearly all trading days (e.g., 99%) do exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, their owners are typically large institutions like Bank of America or JP Morgan <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. These institutions invest enormous resources into developing and testing these sophisticated systems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>.

These powerful algorithms are used exclusively for the institutions' own benefit, and even their wealthiest clients are not permitted to invest through such instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. For instance, Bank of America's annual report details how their trading algorithms profit 98% of the days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:07">[00:08:07]</a>, generating such significant profits that their reports categorize days by earnings exceeding or falling short of $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:18">[00:08:18]</a>.

> The idea that an ordinary individual could create an algorithm superior to those of JP Morgan or Bank of America and then sell it for a mere $300 is inherently ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a>.

## Recommendation

> [!CAUTION]
> Stay away from trading robot products or algorithms offered to the public <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These scams persist because many people mistakenly believe that the stock market offers easy or effortless money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

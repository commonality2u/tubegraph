A core principle in investment, particularly advocated by Warren Buffett, is the **avoidance of debt** to prepare for potential future crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:35">[00:05:35]</a>. While the exact timing of a crisis is unknown, its occurrence is highly likely <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:17">[00:00:17]</a>. Buffett's advice is characterized by common sense and is easily replicable by retail investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Advice on Debt

Warren Buffett emphasizes that both companies and individual investors should [[strategies_for_protecting_investments_during_a_debt_crisis | avoid using debt]], especially when the market has risen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:22">[00:06:22]</a>. He dislikes investing in companies with substantial debt, particularly long-term debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.

### Reasons to Avoid Debt
*   **Reduced Profits**: Long-term debt increases interest rates, which can drastically reduce a company's profits and future cash flows, making them less predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:48">[00:05:48]</a>.
*   **Selling Airlines Example**: This was a primary reason Buffett cited for selling his airline stocks; he anticipated they would emerge from a crisis with increased debt, making their cash flows less predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.
*   **Increased Risk**: Debt heightens the risk for investors, especially when the market is at historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:21">[00:07:21]</a>.

## The Dangers of Margin Debt (Leverage)

The use of margin debt, or leverage, is a common pitfall that leads many investors to unsatisfactory long-term results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:49">[00:06:49]</a>. Historically, people tend to increase their leverage when the stock market has risen significantly, perceiving shares as cheaper and incurring debt to buy at historical highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. This contrasts sharply with periods when stocks were cheapest, such as late 2018 or 2020, where debt levels were negative <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">[00:07:51]</a>.

When the market corrects even slightly, highly indebted investors can lose 50-70% of their account value and are forced to sell shares at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>.

## Counter-Cyclical Investing and Liquidity

Buffett demonstrates a strategy of accumulating significant liquidity before a crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:11">[00:03:11]</a>. For instance, prior to the 2008 crisis, he maintained a high level of liquidity for two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:45">[00:03:45]</a>. During the crisis, he drastically lowered liquidity to make acquisitions at "knockdown prices," leading to substantial returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>. Since 2015, he has again accumulated considerable liquidity, indicating fewer perceived opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:00">[00:04:00]</a>. Currently, he holds $150 billion in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a>.

This strategy emphasizes being "brave to take advantage of opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:11">[00:23:11]</a>: "be fearful when others are greedy and be greedy when others are fearful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:17">[00:23:17]</a>. This means buying good, cheap stocks when the market falls, which is when shares have the least risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:29">[00:06:29]</a>.

## Investing in Productive Assets

Another key piece of [[investment_education_and_strategies | investment education and strategies]] from Warren Buffett for preparing for a future crisis is to always buy productive assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. These are assets that produce income, dividends, or enable share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Unlike non-productive assets like gold, which depend solely on someone else paying more, productive assets generate value intrinsically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>.

During bull markets, non-productive and speculative stocks often rise dramatically, but they are theoretically in less demand when economic conditions become complicated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>. Conversely, good stocks that pay dividends or reinvest profits to grow the business tend to perform much better during challenging times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:12">[00:09:12]</a>. Investing in non-productive companies is generally a losing strategy or performs worse than the market over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>.

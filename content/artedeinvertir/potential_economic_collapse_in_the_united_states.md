The United States faces a critical [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | new economic scenario]] that could affect everyone, regardless of stock market investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. The "clock has started to count" towards a potential [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | economic disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>.

## Janet Yellen's Warnings
Janet Yellen, the current director of the American Treasury and former chairwoman of the Federal Reserve, has warned that this situation could lead to the [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | total collapse of the financial system]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>. She emphasizes that if a solution isn't found in the coming weeks, it would cause irreversible damage to the American economy and to [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | global stability]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>. Yellen has indicated an exact date when a collapse with "terrible consequences" for both stocks and the economy could occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:31">[00:00:31]</a>.

## The Debt Ceiling Problem
The core issue is the United States reaching its debt ceiling <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:31">[00:01:31]</a>. Yellen describes putting an arbitrary debt ceiling and creating periodic, or even self-manufactured, crises that risk the stability of the financial and economic system as "tremendously irresponsible" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The US, like most countries, consistently spends more money than it earns, resulting in a fiscal deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. To finance this spending, new debt is issued, and the country is nearing its established debt limit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

### Initial Measures Taken
To cope with the approaching debt limit, Yellen has initiated "desperate measures" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. These include significant cuts to investments in pension and health plans, as well as suspending government investments for employee retirement plans, totaling over $200 billion in spending cuts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>.

## Market Reaction: Credit Default Swaps (CDs)
Financial markets are already pricing in a potential US bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. Credit Default Swaps (CDs), which are insurance policies against a country's government debt default, have seen their price to insure American government debt multiply by more than nine times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>. This indicates that the financial markets perceive an "enormous" [[current_economic_risks_for_stock_market | risk of collapse]] for the US to stop paying its debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

## Global Impact of US Debt Default
A US debt default would be akin to "gravity ceasing to exist," leading to "total chaos and a [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | financial collapse]]" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>. This is because the entire global financial system is interconnected with American debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>. US treasury bills and bonds represent the largest asset class internationally, currently at over $30 trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. As [[economic_crisis_predictions_by_ray_dalio | Ray Dalio]] explains, one country's debt is another's asset, and millions of entities worldwide hold these traditionally "safest" investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:38">[00:04:38]</a>. A collapse of this asset class would have a chain effect, impacting banks, insurers, private investors, sovereign funds, and pension plans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. This scenario could be 30 times larger than the Lehman Brothers collapse in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.

## Potential Market Reactions to a Default
Should a default occur:
*   The value of dollar bonds and fixed income would collapse due to loss of investor confidence and massive capital outflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>.
*   Stocks and equity investments would also fall sharply, with the exception of certain sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.
*   The price of gold would likely rise sharply, as its value is measured against the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | American dollar]], making it a safe haven <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:44">[00:05:44]</a>.
*   Gold-related companies (mining, royalty) would benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>.
*   Inverse ETFs, which rise when the market falls, could also be used strategically by investors anticipating short-term problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:13">[00:10:13]</a>. An example is the ProShares Short S&P500 ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:42">[00:10:42]</a>.

## White House Report & Consequences
The White House has published a report detailing possible consequences of a debt default:
*   More than 2 million job losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>.
*   An additional cost of over $750 billion annually in interest due to investor distrust <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>.
*   A collapse of the dollar and the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>. The report estimates stock market drops of up to 45% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:21">[00:11:21]</a>.

## Desperate Solution: The Trillion-Dollar Platinum Coin
With Republicans and Democrats at an impasse, desperate solutions are being proposed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>. One such proposal is to mint a trillion-dollar platinum coin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. This seemingly "Hollywood movie" solution is real due to a legal loophole allowing the Treasury to mint unlimited physical coins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. These coins, with an extraordinary value, would be deposited with the Federal Reserve, allowing the government to continue paying expenses without defaulting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>. While a short-term fix, this solution would not send a message of stability to financial markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>, and the value of the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | dollar]], bonds, and stocks would continue to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

## Janet Yellen's Deadline Warning
Janet Yellen has warned that the extraordinary measures taken by the Treasury are a "temporary patch" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. She stated that these measures are likely to be exhausted before the first week of June, implying that the collapse of American debt could be "just around the corner" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:04">[00:09:04]</a>.

### Protecting Investments
Many investors are considering measures to protect themselves, such as betting against US government debt and the stock market, or investing in gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:33">[00:09:33]</a>. Some larger investors might also buy Credit Default Swaps (CDs) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>.

## Historical Precedents
The debt limit scenario was previously reached in 2011 and 2013 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Although temporary solutions were found, markets experienced high volatility in the following weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:43">[00:11:43]</a>.

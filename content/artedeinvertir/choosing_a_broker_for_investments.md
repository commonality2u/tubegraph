## Key Factors for Choosing a Broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:41:00">[06:41:00]</a>

### 1. Security and Jurisdiction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:43:00">[06:43:00]</a>
It is important to consider where a broker is domiciled, as you will be depositing your hard-earned savings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:44:00">[06:44:00]</a>. Look for brokers regulated in secure jurisdictions like the USA, United Kingdom, or countries in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. Avoid brokers domiciled in places like Cyprus or the Cayman Islands <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:59:00">[06:59:00]</a>. The jurisdiction is typically listed at the bottom of the broker's website <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:05:00">[07:05:00]</a>.

### 2. Investment in Cash (Avoiding Derivatives) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:13:00">[07:13:00]</a>
Choose a broker that allows you to invest in "cash" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:15:00">[07:15:00]</a>. This means avoiding derivatives such as CFDs, futures, forex, or options <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. These products often involve leverage and are more complex, which can lead to significant losses for new investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:24:00">[07:24:00]</a>. The goal is to have a satisfactory experience that encourages further study and progress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:30:00">[07:30:00]</a>.

### 3. Wide Range of Assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>
Select a broker that offers a wide enough range of assets for investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>. This increases the likelihood of finding excellent investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:51:00">[07:51:00]</a>.

### 4. Commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:55:00">[07:55:00]</a>
Pay close attention to the [[choosing_the_right_broker_and_managing_commissions|commissions]] charged by the broker <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:56:00">[07:56:00]</a>. Especially when starting with small amounts of money, high commissions can significantly impact your profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:59:00">[07:59:00]</a>. As your capital grows, other factors like service quality or higher security might become more important than minimal commissions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:06:00">[08:06:00]</a>.

[[Bill Gates on the end of the current crisis|Bill Gates]] has recently made a significant interview, generating headlines by explaining why the world might be entering the worst phase of the current crisis, and providing a specific date for its potential conclusion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:06">[00:00:06]</a>.

## Bill Gates' Role in Crisis Prediction
[[Bill Gates role in pandemic prediction and preparation|Bill Gates]] played a notable role in the last crisis, having given months of notice that such a scenario could occur. While he didn't possess a "magic ball," he accurately warned about its potential development and possible solutions. His statements and actions have largely aligned with reality, even including his early identification of the company that would produce a vaccine for the ongoing problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:22">[00:00:22]</a>.

## Current Crisis Outlook
In a recent CNN interview, [[Bill Gates on the end of the current crisis|Bill Gates]] highlighted the escalating number of new cases, noting a rise from an average of two thousand cases per day to peaks of up to three million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. He draws a parallel to the Spanish Flu, which saw multiple waves and mutations, with the final wave being the most contagious but mildest. This historical pattern, combined with the current new variant being about half as severe as the previous Delta variant, is why [[Bill Gates on the end of the current crisis|Bill Gates]] appears convinced about the crisis's trajectory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:26">[00:03:26]</a>. He noted that approximately 70% of new infections are due to this new, less severe variant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

A critical issue, according to Gates, is the lack of vaccination in emerging and very poor countries, which fosters new mutations that can then spread to wealthier nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. While the vaccine may not prevent the virus, it reduces its severity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>.

### Predicted End of the Crisis
[[Bill Gates on the end of the current crisis|Bill Gates]] offers a positive outlook, stating that if the correct steps are taken, the current crisis could conclude by the end of 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:29">[00:04:29]</a>. This potential end would bring benefits to many companies harmed by the crisis, allowing them to return to normality by 2022-2023, which would positively reflect in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:37">[00:04:37]</a>. Conversely, companies that greatly benefited during the crisis, particularly internet technology firms with high valuations, are now starting to see their stock fall as these favorable conditions may not persist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Broader Economic Implications
The discussion extends to potential economic frictions, particularly concerning interest rate hikes by the Fed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. Jerome Powell has indicated that there will likely be three interest rate hikes this year, a forecast much higher than previous predictions which anticipated hikes only beginning in 2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. This has led to significant market volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Monetary policy is expected to normalize during the year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">[00:06:08]</a>. Despite this, there's a belief that the economy will likely remain in a low interest rate environment for many years due to structural reasons, such as high system debt and slowing global population growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. This means interest rates are unlikely to return to past levels of 4-5% but will normalize within a lower context <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:46">[00:06:46]</a>.

A significant warning is issued regarding persistent and high inflation becoming ingrained in the economy and public thought, which would inevitably lead to more restrictive monetary policy and could even result in a recession for workers and the middle class <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. When people begin to act as if inflation is permanent, it can cause immediate price increases across the economy, becoming a dangerous self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>.

A "reverse financial crisis" is closely linked to [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] and the decisions made by [[role_of_central_banks_and_monetary_policy_in_market_evolution | central banks]] and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>. This scenario is becoming increasingly possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>.

## Causes of Inflation and the Reverse Crisis

### Money Printing and Quantitative Easing
The [[federal_reserve_policies_and_market_reactions | Federal Reserve]] and other [[role_of_central_banks_and_monetary_policy_in_market_evolution | central banks]] are "flooding the financial system" with new currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. Since the 2008 financial crisis, printing new money has been the chosen solution to financial problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:11">[00:01:11]</a>. For example, during the 2020 crisis, 22% of all US dollars currently in circulation were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>.

### Government Spending and Fiscal Deficits
Governments are increasingly accustomed to spending more money than they collect through taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. This reliance on borrowing leads to increased national debt, which weakens a currency and generates more [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. The United States deficit reached an impressive 8%, nearing levels seen during the 2008 crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>. Warren Buffett has warned that "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits are going to have consequences" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:01">[00:07:01]</a>.

These factors have contributed to one of the largest [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] crises in the last 40 years, fundamentally changing the economic outlook for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>.

## Impact of Inflation on Investments
In a reverse crisis, like the prices of products and services, investments can experience a dizzying climb that seems endless <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. This can seem positive initially but is very dangerous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>.

### Nominal vs. Real Return
To understand an inverse financial crisis, it's crucial to distinguish between nominal return and real return <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. For example, a 10% nominal return on an investment means a 10,000 unit investment became 11,000 units <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. However, if [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] during the same period was 15%, the real return is negative 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:02">[00:03:02]</a>. This means a loss of purchasing power because product and service prices increased faster than the value of the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

This loss of purchasing power is a "silent problem" that most people ignore until it's too late <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:22">[00:03:22]</a>. Those with less financial literacy often suffer the most, bearing the full cost of [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] without the benefit of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>.

### Current Market Situation
Accumulated [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] from 2021 to the present has reached 20% due to government and [[role_of_central_banks_and_monetary_policy_in_market_evolution | central banks]] policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. Although the S&P 500 has risen, it has not kept pace with [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]]. The index would need to be at 5700 points to compensate for a 20% loss in purchasing power, but it is currently around 5200 points, representing a 10% loss in purchasing power for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Those not investing experienced a total 20% loss in purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | Inflation]] continues to rise, albeit at lower rates than before, increasing the loss of purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.

This phenomenon is causing main stock market indices to rise strongly, with most at historical highs due to the "reverse crisis" effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Role of Real Interest Rates
Reverse crisis processes are closely related to negative real interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. This occurs when the level of [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] exceeds the interest rate set by the [[role_of_central_banks_and_monetary_policy_in_market_evolution | central bank]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:13">[00:05:13]</a>.

In Argentina, the average real interest rate was negative by at least 6% over 12 years, causing one of the country's worst [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>. Europe and the United States also experienced negative real rates of 3% to 4% during 2021 and 2022, though for a shorter period of 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:37">[00:05:37]</a>.

Many large investors fear a second wave of [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] at a higher level than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. The Apollo Group's study suggests that [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] moves in waves and that lowering rates tends to raise [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]], as seen in the 1970s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. Based on this correlation, Apollo Group estimates a new increase in [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]] and negative real interest rates could occur within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

Despite [[role_of_central_banks_and_monetary_policy_in_market_evolution | central banks]]' plans to reduce interest rates, governments continue to face fiscal deficits and spend more money than they take in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Warren Buffett has warned about the potential risk of "extreme [[inflationary_pressures_and_their_implications | inflation]]" in the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>.

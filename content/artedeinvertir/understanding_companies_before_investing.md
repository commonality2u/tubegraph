Warren Buffett, considered the greatest investor of all time, emphasizes the importance of understanding companies before making [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | investments]] in them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>. His approach to [[stock_investment_advice | investment strategies]] stems from a fundamental belief that true understanding goes beyond knowing a company's products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">[00:03:52]</a>.

## Key Principles of Understanding a Business

According to Warren Buffett, understanding a business means having the certainty that:
*   The company will be generating profits in ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.
*   Those future profits will be greater than what it currently produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

A major secret to Buffett's long-term success in [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | investments]] is to avoid investing in very new or rapidly changing sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This is because he believes it's difficult to analyze and predict the future of companies in such volatile environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a>.

## Examples of Company Understanding

### McDonald's (MCD)

McDonald's is cited as one of Warren Buffett's favorite [[examples_of_highquality_companies_as_investment_opportunities | investments]] due to its predictable nature <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>. Listed in the US under the ticker MCD at approximately $210 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>, it embodies the characteristics of an easily understandable business:
*   Technological changes, such as the internet, are unlikely to stop people from consuming hamburgers or Coca-Cola <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>.
*   The company's revenue generation model is straightforward to understand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>.
*   It faces few risks that could lead to its demise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:44">[00:04:44]</a>.
*   It's easy to project that McDonald's will continue to generate increasing profits in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:47">[00:04:47]</a>.

This predictability has allowed McDonald's shares to multiply by over three times on the stock market in the last decade, from $70 to more than $210, and it is expected to continue providing good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:53">[00:04:53]</a>.

### Intel - A Counter-Example

In contrast, the technology sector is considered much more volatile <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Intel serves as an example of a company Warren Buffett has historically avoided investing in <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>. While many believed companies like NVIDIA or AMD couldn't successfully compete with Intel, the reality has changed dramatically in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. Intel's profit and revenue outlook has become more complicated, leading to poor stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. This illustrates the difficulty of predicting the future in rapidly evolving industries.

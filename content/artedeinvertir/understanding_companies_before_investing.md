Warren Buffett, considered the greatest investor of all time, revealed seven basic principles he used to achieve tremendous success in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. Adhering to these principles can help new investors understand and evaluate companies before committing capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Invest in Good Companies, Avoid Mediocre Businesses

Buffett advises against investing in low-quality businesses, even if their stocks appear cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. Such companies typically do not generate long-term value, and while a quick 30-40% gain might occur, shares must be sold to realize profits, preventing investors from benefiting from the [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies | compound capitalization effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:01">[00:01:01]</a>.

Conversely, [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies | investing in exceptional businesses]] that generate significant long-term value offers two major advantages, even if their initial [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuation]] is slightly higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a>:
1.  **Efficiency**: The analytical work is done once, potentially yielding returns for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">[00:01:25]</a>.
2.  **Compounding**: These shares can multiply significantly (e.g., 8, 10, 20, or 50 times) due to the [[understanding_and_investing_in_compounders_and_undervalued_companies | compound capitalization effect]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>.

### Examples of Company Performance

*   **General Motors**: An example of a "bad stock" that has not generated long-term value; its price has seen little movement over the past decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:45">[00:01:45]</a>. While short-term gains (30-40%) might occur, it is not a stock that will multiply several times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:04">[00:02:04]</a>.
*   **Moody's**: Considered an "exceptional business," Moody's (ticker MC) has multiplied by more than 10 times on the stock market in the last 10 years, reflecting its long-term value generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

### Identifying Good Businesses

To identify good businesses, consider two methods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:59">[00:02:59]</a>:
1.  **Fundamental Analysis**: Study the company's fundamentals, including its operations, profit and loss account, and balance sheet. Focus especially on consistent growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.
2.  **Stock Performance**: For beginners, observe a stock's historical performance. If a company's shares have not multiplied several times in the past 10 or 20 years, it is likely not a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">[00:03:23]</a>. Subsequently, the [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | company's valuation]] should be assessed before investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

## Understand Companies Before Investing

Warren Buffett emphasizes that understanding a business goes beyond knowing its products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:48">[00:03:48]</a>. It means having certainty that the company will generate profits in ten years, and those profits will be greater than current production <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:59">[00:03:59]</a>.

A key secret to Buffett's success is avoiding investments in very new or rapidly changing sectors because he cannot reliably analyze their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>.

### Examples of Understanding and Not Understanding a Business

*   **McDonald's (MCD)**: A favorite Buffett investment, McDonald's is easy to understand because technological changes like the internet won't stop people from eating hamburgers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>. The company's revenue generation, low risks, and predictable long-term profit growth make it a comprehensible investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. McDonald's shares have more than tripled in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">[00:04:56]</a>.
*   **Intel**: In contrast, Buffett has historically avoided the constantly changing technology sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Intel, for example, faced unexpected competition from companies like NVIDIA, leading to a much more complicated profit and revenue outlook and poor stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:11">[00:05:11]</a>.

## Invest Using Facts, Not Emotions

One of Buffett's best tips is to invest based on facts rather than emotions, as emotions are a primary reason many investors underperform <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>.

Buffett noted that investors often get overexcited during bull markets, buying stocks that are already rising, and ignore those that haven't performed well, even if they are good businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>. This emotional behavior creates significant [[investment_opportunities_in_various_sectors_and_companies | opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:38">[00:11:38]</a>.

### Example: Disney

For five years, Disney (ticker DIS) shares performed sideways while the rest of the market rose <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>. However, in recent months, Disney's stock has more than doubled, despite the business and its assets remaining the same <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">[00:12:12]</a>. This scenario exemplifies the "giant opportunities" Buffett described <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:20">[00:12:20]</a>.

## Invest Only in Companies with Talented and Integral Managers

It's crucial to remember that behind every share is a business run by people whose decisions will fundamentally impact the company's future and stock market evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">[00:12:42]</a>.

### Aligned Interests

Buffett recommends investing in companies where management holds many shares of the company itself <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">[00:13:29]</a>. This alignment of interests ensures that managers benefit when shareholders do <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:34">[00:13:34]</a>.

*   **Example: Amazon (AMZN)**: Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, demonstrated enormous business talent and consistently treated shareholders with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.
*   **Checking Management Holdings**: Websites like Morningstar.com or MarketScreener.com allow investors to easily check the number of shares held by management and their salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>. Ideally, the value of management's shares should be ten times higher than their salary, ensuring aligned interests and a positive long-term outlook for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">[00:13:57]</a>.

## Always Buy Shares Below Their Intrinsic Value

Perhaps the most important piece of advice is to always buy shares below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>. This subjective value is calculated by the investor through a [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | stock valuation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>.

To value shares, make a conservative estimate of future benefits and apply various [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuation methods]] to determine the intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

### Example: Coca-Cola

Using Coca-Cola shares as an example, the market price (red line) can be compared to the calculated intrinsic value (blue line) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:19">[00:15:19]</a>. When the market price was above the intrinsic value (e.g., 2003-2004), it was not a good time to invest, and shares subsequently declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:27">[00:15:27]</a>. Conversely, when the price was below the intrinsic value (e.g., 2009 or 2012), subsequent stock market performance was strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">[00:15:39]</a>.

While [[valuation_and_growth_potential_of_companies | valuing shares]] requires learning, it is a simple process that is key to successful investing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">[00:15:45]</a>.

In light of recent stock market drops, many people are questioning if this signals the start of a crisis or merely a buying opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. Relevant data from the past week indicates that the [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements|Federal Reserve]] has opted against intervening in the market with new measures; in fact, it has stated the opposite, contributing to recent market declines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>.

## Fed's Non-Intervention Stance

The [[role_of_federal_reserve_and_central_banks_in_market_movements|Federal Reserve]] has explicitly chosen not to come to the market's rescue, determining that a correction is necessary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:47">[00:00:47]</a>. In a speech given recently, the Fed communicated that individuals should manage their own financial situations, and that for the time being, they will not intervene to save the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:05">[00:12:05]</a>. It is often believed that the Fed only begins to panic when the market falls by 10%; however, recent drops have only been around 7-10% depending on the index, suggesting that significant intervention is not yet imminent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>.

## Monetary Policy Outlook

Despite market volatility and slowed growth prospects, Jerome Powell stated that it is still too early to lower interest rates or provide a "floor" to the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:33">[00:12:33]</a>. Powell explicitly said, "we are in no hurry to lower interest rates; we are in a position where we can afford to wait" for greater clarity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>. The Fed remains focused on inflation risks, maintaining that interest rates need to stay high if inflation data does not improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:59">[00:12:59]</a>. However, they have noted that they could act if employment issues arise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>.

### Economic Reports and Forecasts
[[Federal Reserves economic reports and recession predictions|Federal Reserve]] studies, such as those from Atlanta, provide forecasts on economic indicators like GDP and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:17">[00:06:17]</a>. For instance, the growth forecast for the first quarter worsened from 1.5% to -2.4% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. The latest job creation figures are also among the lowest in two years, registering at 77,000, which has added to market concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:18">[00:09:18]</a>.

### Potential Secret Agreement and Dollar Weakening
There is speculation about a [[federal_reserves_secret_meeting_and_its_impact_on_monetary_policy|secret agreement]]—dubbed "sea to lake"—reminiscent of the Plaza Hotel agreement, where central bankers met to intentionally devalue the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. A weaker dollar is generally desired globally, particularly by emerging countries with dollar-denominated debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:24">[00:10:24]</a>. The current US administration's focus on promoting exports also makes a weak dollar key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:46">[00:10:46]</a>. A potential economic slowdown could accelerate forecasts for interest rate cuts, theoretically leading to a weaker dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:55">[00:10:55]</a>. This dollar depreciation, coupled with stock market declines, can result in double losses for international investors in American stocks, leading to increased discomfort and selling pressure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:06">[00:11:06]</a>.

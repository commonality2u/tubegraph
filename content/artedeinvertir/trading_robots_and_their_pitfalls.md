[[Stock market scams and how to detect them | Dangerous scams]] exist in the world of the [[Stock Market Risks and Strategies | stock market and investments]], and one notable example is the scam involving trading robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>.

## What Are Trading Robots?
Trading robots are presented as computer programs or algorithms that supposedly operate automatically to generate consistent profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. To make these scams appear legitimate, perpetrators often provide fake evidence, such as screenshots of bank statements or real-time trading displays that show the purported program's performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:12">[00:07:12]</a>.

## The Pitfall: Why the Scam Doesn't Make Sense
The fundamental flaw in the trading robot scam lies in its basic premise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>. It's illogical for someone to offer a tool capable of generating money automatically without effort for a small fee, typically less than ten thousand dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">[00:07:27]</a>. The idea that an ordinary individual could create an algorithm superior to those of major financial institutions and sell it for a mere $300 is considered ridiculous <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:27">[00:08:27]</a>.

### Reality of High-Performing Algorithms
In reality, algorithms exist that can produce profits on nearly 99% of trading days <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. However, these are owned by large institutions like Bank of America or JP Morgan, which have invested immense resources in their development and testing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. These powerful algorithms are used exclusively for the institutions' own benefit, and even their wealthiest clients are not permitted to [[opportunities_and_risks_in_stock_market_investing | invest]] through such instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:53">[00:07:53]</a>. For example, the Bank of America's annual report (page 74) mentions that its trading algorithms are profitable 98% of the days, generating so much profit that reports differentiate between days earning more or less than $25 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:04">[00:08:04]</a>.

## Recommendation
[!WARNING] Stay away from any products or algorithms that claim to be trading robots <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:38">[00:08:38]</a>. These scams persist because many people believe that the [[Stock Market Risks and Strategies | stock market]] offers easy, effortless money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>.

The Art of Investing live stream discussed [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio's economic predictions]] and potential investment strategies. The speaker analyzed a recent interview where [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | Ray Dalio]] made "pretty shocking statements" about the economy possibly facing a situation worse than 2008, even resembling the Great Depression of 1929, when the market fell 82% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>.

## About Ray Dalio
[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] is the founder of Bridgewater, currently the world's largest hedge fund, managing approximately 170 trillion dollars (this amount fluctuates) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:02:02">[03:02:02]</a>. He started with a very small amount and is known for generating good, predictable returns, rarely losing money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:10:50">[03:10:50]</a>. His opinions tend to influence the current market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:36:09">[03:36:09]</a>.

## Key Factors Indicating a Potential Crisis
In his interview, [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | Ray Dalio]] highlighted three major problems that could seriously impact the future of the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:48">[02:48:48]</a>:

### 1. Rise of China and the Yuan
[[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | Ray Dalio]] identified the rise of China and the Yuan as an alternative currency to the dollar as a significant factor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:46:27">[03:46:27]</a>. Similar to how the United States gained economic hegemony from the British pound at the beginning of the century, China's GDP is projected to surpass that of the U.S. by 2026-2027, potentially becoming the largest economy globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:52:39">[03:52:39]</a>. This could create a paradigm shift because a lot of global debt is in dollars, and the dollar is the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:12:44">[04:12:44]</a>. The U.S. currently prints vast amounts of money without significant harm due to the dollar's status <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:21:05">[04:21:05]</a>. However, the dollar's market share has been declining since 2014, as confidence in it wanes due to continuous printing and the emergence of alternatives like the Yuan, Yen, and Euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:27:07">[05:27:07]</a>. If the U.S. loses this hegemony, they may no longer be able to print money without causing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:50:06">[05:50:06]</a>.

### 2. Economic Inequality
Another major risk is the growing economic inequality between rich and poor classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:01:21">[06:01:21]</a>. The wealthiest 1% in the U.S. have increased their share of national wealth from 10% to over 20%, while the poorest 50% (nearly 200 million people) have seen their share drop from 20% to less than 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:04">[06:14:04]</a>. These movements can lead to the rise of politicians with communist or populist tendencies, attracting ideas that are not pro-capitalist, which negatively affects the economy and stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:59">[06:37:59]</a>. Such political shifts could result in higher taxes, more regulations, and increased difficulty in doing business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:07:07">[07:07:07]</a>. The period from 1938 to 1950, when taxes were high and the environment was not capitalist, was "terrible for the stock market," leading to 20 "lost years" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:39:13">[07:39:13]</a>.

### 3. Unprecedented Money Printing
The third risk is the "financial experiment" of unprecedented money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:02:40">[08:02:40]</a>. Global liquidity, which is the printing of money, has a tremendous impact on the market, showing a high correlation with the S&P 500's behavior over the last 5-6 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:11:00">[08:11:00]</a>. The amount of money printed during the current crisis is even greater than in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:07">[09:05:07]</a>. This is already producing inflation, reflected in rising home prices and real estate investment, with inventories at minimums <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:14:46">[09:14:46]</a>.

## Investment Strategies to Protect Against Crisis

### Ray Dalio's Approach: The All-Weather Portfolio
[[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | Ray Dalio]] utilizes a strategy known as the "All Weather Portfolio" or "Four Seasons Portfolio" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:15:23">[11:15:23]</a>. This involves investing in a diversified mix of assets including stocks, bonds from emerging countries, commodities, and inflation-protected bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:31:02">[11:31:02]</a>. The theory is that this portfolio performs well across four main economic scenarios: rising economic growth and inflation, or rising inflation and declining economic growth, among others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:40">[11:41:40]</a>. Although he is aware of a liquidity bubble in fixed income, his fund has adjusted its investment in those categories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:21:04">[12:21:04]</a>.

### Warren Buffett's Approach: Quality and Liquidity
For small investors, a more replicable method is that of Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:01:03">[13:01:03]</a>. Buffett, despite thinking the market is expensive, doesn't fully liquidate or bet against it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:08:44">[13:08:44]</a>. He has historically warned of economic cycles, for example, returning capital to investors in 1969 and warning the market was expensive before the 1999 crash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:17:09">[13:17:09]</a>.

Currently, Buffett's movements show he has accumulated a lot of liquidity (around $130 billion) over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:47:04">[13:47:04]</a>. This allows him to take advantage of future opportunities during volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:00:26">[14:00:26]</a>. His portfolio consistently features very good, high-quality companies that maintain their value even if the market declines because they offer essential products or services <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:09:12">[14:09:12]</a>. Examples include Amazon, Visa, Mastercard, and Moody's â€“ businesses that are non-cyclical, have low debt, and are bought at reasonable valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:21:03">[14:21:03]</a>. Volatility is considered a "friend" as it creates opportunities to buy shares at "ridiculous prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:57:48">[14:57:48]</a>. He recommends stocks over bonds, viewing fixed income as a bubble due to very high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:48:38">[14:48:38]</a>.

## Anti-Crisis Investment Opportunities

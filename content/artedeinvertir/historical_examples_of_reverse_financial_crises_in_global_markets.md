A [[reverse_financial_crisis_and_its_implications | reverse financial crisis]] is a scenario where investment values escalate dramatically, seemingly without end, in an environment of continuous inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:05">[00:02:05]</a>. This phenomenon is closely tied to inflation and the monetary policies enacted by central banks and governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## Causes and Context
Since 2008, central banks, including the Federal Reserve, have consistently opted to print new money as a solution to financial crises, flooding the system with new euros, dollars, or pounds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:05">[00:01:05]</a>. For instance, in the 2020 crisis, 22% of the total dollars currently in circulation were printed in a single year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:21">[00:01:21]</a>. This practice, combined with governments increasingly spending more money than they collect in taxes, leads to increased debt, weakened currency, and higher inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>. The United States deficit reached an impressive 8%, nearing levels seen during the 2008 crisis, which contributed to one of the largest inflation crises in 40 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">[00:01:46]</a>.

## Historical Instances
This type of [[reverse_financial_crisis_and_its_implications | reverse crisis]] has already occurred in the main stock markets of several countries:

*   **Argentina**
    The Merval index of Argentina has multiplied by 60 times in the last five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:31">[00:02:31]</a>. Over the past 12 years, Argentina's average real interest rate has been negative at least 6%, contributing to one of the country's worst inflation crises on record <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:23">[00:05:23]</a>.
*   **Turkey**
    Turkey's market saw a rise of 700% in just five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:36">[00:02:36]</a>.
*   **Germany**
    Germany experienced an 800% rise in less than two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:41">[00:02:41]</a>.
*   **Europe and the United States (Recent)**
    During 2021 and 2022, Europe and the United States also saw negative real rates of return, specifically 3% and 4% respectively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:39">[00:05:39]</a>. While this period lasted only about 12 to 24 months, it had significant consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:51">[00:05:51]</a>.

## Nominal vs. Real Returns
Understanding a [[reverse_financial_crisis_and_its_implications | reverse financial crisis]] requires distinguishing between nominal and real returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. If an investment yields a 10% nominal return, but inflation during the same period is 15%, the real return is a negative 5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a>. This means purchasing power is lost because the price of services and products increased faster than the value of the money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:13">[00:03:13]</a>.

The process of increasing inflation has already begun <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:53">[00:03:53]</a>. Accumulated inflation from 2021 until now has reached 20% due to government and central bank policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>. For example, the S&P 500, to compensate for this inflation, would have needed to rise by 20% to 5700 points, but it currently trades at 5200 points, representing a 10% loss in purchasing power for investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">[00:04:08]</a>. This drives major stock market indices to rise very strongly, with most at historical highs, due to the effect of [[reverse_financial_crisis_and_its_implications | reverse crises]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>.

## Correlation with Negative Real Interest Rates
These processes are closely related to negative real interest rates, which occur when inflation levels are higher than the interest rates set by central banks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:08">[00:05:08]</a>. There is a fear among many large investors of a second wave of inflation, at a higher level than the first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:55">[00:05:55]</a>. A study by the Apollo Group indicates that inflation tends to move in waves, and when the Fed lowers rates, it often raises inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:03">[00:06:03]</a>. This pattern was observed in the 1970s and shows a high correlation with current events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. The Apollo Group estimates a new increase in inflation and negative real interest rates could occur within 12 to 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

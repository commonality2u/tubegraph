According to [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] and his Bridgewater team, there is a new significant risk for the stock market emerging in September. They predict an additional drop of 20% to 25% for the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. This assessment is based on the expectation that things will likely worsen before they improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:14">[00:01:14]</a>.

In a recent statement published in Fortune magazine, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] highlighted that the world is in a "totally different" investment environment, expecting stock prices to fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:23">[00:02:23]</a>. Bridgewater's prediction for the market differs from current market estimates: while the market anticipates a drop in inflation without a recession, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] forecasts a drop in inflation *with* a recession <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:38">[00:02:38]</a>. He also believes that inflation will be more persistent than what the market is currently discounting <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>.

## Reasons for the September Risk
The core of [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]]'s September prediction stems from the anticipated withdrawal of stimulus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:33">[00:03:33]</a>. This withdrawal is expected to make the market significantly more complicated starting in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### Three Major Market Risks
[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] and Bridgewater identify three primary risks for the next six to twelve months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>:
1.  **Pressure from Multiples:** The S&P 500 has already seen its earnings multiple fall from 24x to about 17x <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. While this risk is largely "implicit in the current price," it could still worsen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">[00:04:23]</a>.
2.  **Drop in Corporate Profits:** A recession typically causes a 10-20% drop in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:32">[00:04:32]</a>. This risk is not yet fully priced into the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>.
3.  **Liquidity in the System:** The availability of money influences investment and business confidence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>. This is closely tied to interest rates and quantitative tightening <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.

Points 2 and 3 are highly correlated: aggressive rate hikes lead to recession and profit drops, which are negative for stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>. It is highly probable that at least two of these three risks will materialize <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>.

## Quantitative Tightening (QT)
The "new equally dangerous risk" is Quantitative Tightening (QT) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. This is the opposite of Quantitative Easing (QE), where central banks print money to buy bonds and inject liquidity into the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. QT involves withdrawing money from the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>.

QT becomes critical now because it coincides with the fight against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:44">[00:07:44]</a>. While interest rate hikes help control inflation, the withdrawal of liquidity (QT) is also a key tool. The full force of QT, involving a monthly withdrawal of $95 billion (amounting to almost a trillion annually), begins in September <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:15">[00:08:15]</a>. Historically, periods of money withdrawal (QT) correlate with worse market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>. The Federal Reserve plans to reduce its balance sheet to pre-pandemic levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

### Seasonal Market Trends
September is historically the worst month for the stock market, often seeing the deepest drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:24">[01:12:24]</a>. This is attributed to a psychological factor where people return from vacation and feel more depressed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:33">[01:12:33]</a>. Conversely, October through April tend to be among the best months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:04">[01:13:04]</a>.

## [[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio's Investment Advice]]
[[ray_dalios_investment_advice_and_portfolio_strategies | Ray Dalio]] and Bridgewater state that investors cannot completely escape the upcoming market downturn, as it will affect everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:51">[01:13:51]</a>. However, they advise investors to:
*   **Reduce Risks:** Generally decrease exposure to risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:58">[01:13:58]</a>.
*   **Diversify Globally:** Not just across regions, but across asset classes, including bonds and quality stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:00">[01:14:00]</a>.
*   **Focus on Quality Stocks:** Prioritize companies that are not cyclical, have low debt, and are profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:12">[01:14:12]</a>.
*   **Diversify Sectorally:** Avoid sectors highly sensitive to the economic cycle or drops in returns, such as automobile, banking, insurance, construction, and transportation companies, especially if they carry debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:21">[01:14:21]</a>. Raw material and materials companies are also suffering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:57">[01:14:57]</a>. Gold is not historically a safe haven in these scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:05">[01:15:05]</a>.

## Market Sentiment and Opportunities
Current consumer and investor negativity is falling significantly, with many people expecting stock prices to go down <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:51:50">[01:51:50]</a>. However, this high negativity coupled with sustained high exposure to stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:24">[02:20:24]</a> (unlike in 2008 when exposure was reduced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:27">[02:20:27]</a>) suggests potential for a second phase of volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:38">[02:20:38]</a>. Paradoxically, this is precisely when investing becomes more interesting, as low expectations often precede better performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:44">[02:20:44]</a>.

European markets, in particular, show valuations at "ridiculous levels," comparable to the 2020 confinement period, despite the economic situation not being as paralyzed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:13">[02:21:13]</a>. Individual stock valuations have dropped significantly, presenting opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:38">[02:21:38]</a>. The speaker emphasizes that "the worse the situation is, the less it takes for it to turn around and start to rise" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:46">[02:21:46]</a>. When problems like inflation and energy prices are the focus of institutions and politicians, solutions tend to be found, leading to a market rebound <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:08">[02:22:08]</a>. Current stock valuations are well below the historical average, making them ripe for quick appreciation once sentiment shifts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:56">[02:22:56]</a>.

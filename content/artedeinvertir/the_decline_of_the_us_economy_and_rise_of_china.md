The world is on the cusp of a significant economic transformation, which the renowned economist and investor Ray Dalio predicts will be the most substantial societal and economic change in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:00">[00:31:00]</a>. These impending shifts are expected to have serious implications for the value of currencies like the dollar and euro, real estate investments, and the cost of living due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:00">[00:17:00]</a>. Dalio has indicated a specific timeframe within the next five years for these major changes to unfold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Credibility and Warnings

Ray Dalio is a highly influential figure in the economic sphere, managing over $100 billion through his company, Bridgewater, making him the world's largest investment fund manager <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:00">[01:03:00]</a>. The assets he manages exceed the Gross Domestic Product of some global countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:00">[01:20:00]</a>. He has a proven track record of accurately predicting major economic changes, enabling him to safeguard his investment portfolios through crises like the 2008 financial meltdown and the 2000 tech bubble <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:00">[01:28:00]</a>.

Having become a multimillionaire, Dalio has publicly shared his research on the economy and future outlook in his book, "The New World Order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:44:00">[01:44:00]</a>. He has consistently warned society to adapt to the incoming [[economic_impact_of_the_new_world_order | new economic reality]] to avoid severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:01:00">[02:01:00]</a>. In a recent interview, he revealed the exact date he believes these economic changes will begin and the factors that will trigger them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:06:00">[02:06:00]</a>.

## Three Converging Problems

Dalio identifies three primary problems converging to create an even larger challenge for the global economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:00">[02:18:00]</a>:

1.  **A Monetary Problem and Debt Cycle**: This includes a [[impending_economic_recession_and_debt_crisis | recession]] coupled with significant social inequality, leading to societal and political polarization <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:00">[02:29:00]</a>. Dalio notes that the problem of class inequality contributes to the rise of populist parties, which negatively impacts economic prosperity and social well-being <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>. In the United States, 90% of the population increasingly owns less wealth, while a mere 10% controls 75% of the nation's wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. The 2020 crisis exacerbated this issue as governments incurred massive debt to save the economy, a burden that will fall on the working class through taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:09:00">[03:09:00]</a>.
2.  **The Decline of US Competitive Advantage**: The United States is losing its competitive edge to China, which will have severe repercussions for Western wealth levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:51:00">[03:51:00]</a>.

### The [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | Decline of the US]] and the [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | Rise of China]]

Ray Dalio characterizes the United States as a 75-year-old empire exhibiting clear signs of [[potential_economic_collapse_in_the_united_states | decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:05:00">[04:05:00]</a>. The US is currently in a terminal phase of its credit cycle, characterized by high levels of debt and extensive money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:00">[04:10:00]</a>. While historically, the dominant global power could print debt without devaluing its currency, Dalio questions what will happen when China surpasses the US in gross domestic product and global influence across military, technological innovation, and political spheres <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:37:00">[04:37:00]</a>.

In past crises, the solution for the US has been to print new dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:57:00">[04:57:00]</a>. However, Dalio poses a critical question: what if, in the next crisis, people lose confidence in the [[the_decline_of_the_us_dollar_and_its_global_impact | dollar]] and it no longer holds its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:03:00">[05:03:00]</a>? In 2020 alone, over 20% of the total dollars in circulation were printed, a massive issuance considering the dollar's two-century history <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:09:00">[05:09:00]</a>.

China is projected to [[rising_economic_influence_of_china_and_its_impact | surpass the United States in GDP]] around the year 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:32:00">[05:32:00]</a>. Dalio predicts that within five years, foreigners who have been lending money to the US may cease to do so, and the [[decline_of_the_us_dollar_as_world_reserve_currency | dollar may no longer be as readily accepted globally]] for purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:46:00">[05:46:00]</a>. He warns that as difficult times arise, society will face internal conflicts, with the poor seeking more from the rich, and the rich attempting to protect their assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:02:00">[06:02:00]</a>. This emphasizes the need for individuals to act immediately to protect their savings and investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:17:00">[06:17:00]</a>.

### Economic Phases: Rise and Decline

Ray Dalio's research into economies and their histories reveals two fundamental phases: [[rise_of_china_and_the_decline_of_the_us | rise and decline]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:48:00">[06:48:00]</a>. Each phase is characterized by specific events that provide clues about the prevailing economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:57:00">[06:57:00]</a>. Dalio's analysis indicates that the US is entering the decline phase, marked by high debt levels and alarming quantities of money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:04:00">[07:04:00]</a>. Conversely, China is in an ascending phase, characterized by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:14:00">[07:14:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Investment Advice

To protect savings and investments in this new economic scenario, Dalio offers key advice:

*   **Avoid Liquidity**: Due to the massive printing of money, inflation emerges, which diminishes purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. Therefore, individuals are compelled to become investors, whether in stocks, real estate, or other assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:12:00">[08:12:00]</a>.
*   **Diversify**: Diversification should extend across countries, currencies, and assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:35:00">[08:35:00]</a>. A well-diversified portfolio ensures that if one asset declines, another may rise, providing relative stability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:42:00">[08:42:00]</a>. Dalio's "Four Seasons Portfolio" theory emphasizes preparing a portfolio for both good and bad economic times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:57:00">[08:57:00]</a>.

### Portfolio Allocation Recommendations

Dalio recommends a specific asset allocation for a resilient portfolio:

*   **Stocks (40%)**: In the current economic environment, characterized by high but expected-to-drop inflation, emerging market stocks and small-cap stocks perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:58:00">[09:58:00]</a>.
    *   **Emerging Market Stocks**: These are a key investment for Dalio, with three of his five main investments being ETFs related to emerging market stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>. Investing in ETFs for emerging countries is a prudent strategy if one lacks deep knowledge of the specific economies or stocks of those countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:44:00">[10:44:00]</a>.
    *   **Small-Cap Stocks**: While challenging for large investors like Dalio to invest directly due to liquidity issues, ETFs like IWM (Russell 2000 index ETF) offer exposure to the 2,000 main small-cap companies in the US <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:26:00">[11:26:00]</a>. Historically, these stocks have yielded returns greater than 17% annually under similar economic conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. Small-cap stocks often have less market following, greater growth potential, and are less accessible to large institutional investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.
*   **Gold (small percentage, never exceeding 10%)**: Gold can be included through ETFs related to gold mining companies or those representing physical gold <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:19:00">[13:19:00]</a>. Interestingly, in the current scenario, gold has one of the worst performances <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:18:00">[10:18:00]</a>.
*   **Bonds (never exceeding 40%)**: This includes inflation-protected bonds, which are currently very appealing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:34:00">[13:34:00]</a>. Bonds provide a defensive component to the portfolio, tending to perform well when other investments like stocks decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:48:00">[13:48:00]</a>. However, Dalio notes a "bubble" in the bond market due to government money printing and advises a more conservative asset allocation to this segment currently <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:56:00">[13:56:00]</a>.

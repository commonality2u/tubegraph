Renowned economist and investor Raidalio emphasizes the critical need for [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio | diversification]] within an investment portfolio, especially during periods of economic uncertainty. He advises investors to adapt their portfolios to navigate challenging financial environments, such as a potential debt crisis within the next three years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:00">[00:09:00]</a>.

## Raidalio's General Portfolio Recommendations

Raidalio generally recommends dividing investment portfolios into several categories:
*   **Safe Investments:** Including bonds or fixed income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. However, he notes that in the current crisis, bonds have fallen in value and have not provided the expected refuge <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.
*   **Gold:** A portion of gold to protect against inflation or geopolitical events <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>. Raidalio considers gold the purest form of money, uncontrollable by governments and not subject to devaluation through printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:14">[00:12:14]</a>. He suggests allocating between 10% and 15% of a portfolio to gold-related investments, which can be done through ETFs like GLD or gold mining companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:35">[00:11:35]</a>.
*   **Stocks:** A significant portion of stocks, which he considers the most important part of an investor's portfolio, as they offer the best long-term returns over the past 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:44">[00:09:44]</a>.

## Stock Investment Advice

In volatile economic environments, not just any type of [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | stock investment]] is advisable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:50">[00:13:50]</a>. Raidalio's primary piece of [[stock_investment_advice | advice]] for [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | investing in stocks]] is [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio | diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">[00:13:52]</a>.

### Key Diversification Strategies
*   **Sectoral Diversification:** Investors should hold stocks across at least six different economic sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:58">[00:13:58]</a>. Recommended sectors include healthcare, technology, and real estate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:02">[00:14:02]</a>.
*   **Company Diversification:** It is advisable to hold at least 10, 15, or 20 different stocks to achieve adequate [[building_a_diversified_investment_portfolio | diversification]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>. These should ideally be quality, well-managed companies with low debt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:14">[00:14:14]</a>.

### Raidalio's Portfolio Allocation Examples

By examining Raidalio's own portfolio, which is periodically made public for investors managing over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">[00:14:25]</a>, one can see his practical application of these principles:
*   **Technology Companies:** Recent increases in positions in famous technology companies like Microsoft, Google, Facebook, and Tesla <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.
*   **Defensive Consumer Companies:** Investments in companies such as Pepsi, Coca-Cola, and McDonald's, which offer protection in challenging economic environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:56">[00:14:56]</a>.
*   **Healthcare Sector:** Seeking refuge in the healthcare sector, which is highly resilient to economic downturns, through pharmaceutical companies like Pfizer, Merck, and Johnson & Johnson, as well as U.S. health insurance companies like CIGNA <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:09">[00:15:09]</a>.

### Sector Performance During Recessions

Analysis of previous recessions indicates which sectors typically suffer the most and which perform best <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>:
*   **Most Vulnerable:** Real estate, technology, financial sectors, and discretionary consumption (e.g., automobile companies, airlines, businesses where consumers can easily cut spending) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>.
*   **Best Performers:** Healthcare, energy, and utility companies (e.g., electricity, water, internet) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:51">[00:15:51]</a>.

Raidalio's current [[fund_management_and_investment_diversification_strategies | investment strategy]] largely aligns with these findings, focusing on healthcare and defensive consumer sectors, which are also relatively insulated from the current tariff crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>.

## Long-Term Perspective

Economic crises typically last between 18 and 24 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:19">[00:16:19]</a>. This period presents an opportunity to buy shares in large companies at attractive valuations, which can significantly enhance long-term performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:24">[00:16:24]</a>. Therefore, viewing these situations as long-term opportunities and focusing on increasing investment knowledge is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:34">[00:16:34]</a>.

Understanding stock valuation is crucial for investors aiming to generate long-term wealth and make informed decisions. It involves assessing the true worth of a company to determine if its stock price is cheap or expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>. This approach contrasts with speculative investments and helps navigate market volatility.

## The Dangers of Not Understanding Valuation

Easy money policies, such as quantitative easing, have fueled speculative bubbles in various asset classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:54:00">[03:54:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:17:00">[07:17:00]</a>. Examples include electric vehicle stocks, SPACs, renewable energy companies, cloud software firms, and cryptocurrencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:25:00">[07:25:00]</a>. These assets often saw "crazy" achievements, multiplying in value by 13 to 20 times, which is unsustainable and leads to unrealistic expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:46:00">[07:46:00]</a>.

Many popular stocks in 2020 achieved fantastic gains because the Fed and central banks printed huge amounts of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:52:00">[08:52:00]</a>. However, these companies often did not produce profits and were valued at "stratospheric multiples," sometimes 40 times sales or 300 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:24:00">[09:24:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>. Financial books generally advise against investing in companies valued at more than 10 times sales or 50 to 100 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:32:00">[09:32:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:41:00">[10:41:00]</a>.

Investing in a portfolio of such overvalued stocks does not truly diversify risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. When easy money stops flowing and economic conditions harden (e.g., rising interest rates and inflation), these bubbles tend to reverse <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:27:00">[11:27:00]</a>. This often results in significant drops, as seen in many SPACs and growth stocks that experienced average declines of 50-70% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:01:00">[12:01:00]</a>. When inflation appears, investors prioritize companies that generate immediate cash flow, unlike many long-term, non-profit-generating projects that characterize speculative investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:17:00">[12:17:00]</a>.

## Bill Ackman's Investment Strategy

Prominent investor Bill Ackman, known for his track record of a 17% net return and his famous 2020 macroeconomic bet that turned $27 million into $2.6 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:15:00">[03:15:00]</a>, warns about the current bubble situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:00">[00:20:00]</a>. His investment philosophy, shared by other major investors like Warren Buffett, emphasizes owning "predictable and resilient companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:55:00">[20:55:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:09:00">[19:09:00]</a>. These are businesses whose earnings are predictable and that can withstand economic crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:01:00">[21:01:00]</a>.

### Key Characteristics of Resilient Businesses
Ackman highlights that the most desirable feature in 2022 is "pricing power" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:23:00">[23:23:00]</a>. This is the ability to raise prices without losing customers, even when costs increase due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="23:31:00">[23:31:00]</a>.

He invests in companies that benefit from rising interest rates and inflation because they can pass on increased costs to customers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:28:00">[22:28:00]</a>.

### Examples of Resilient Businesses
*   **Domino's Pizza and Chipotle Mexican Grill:** People will continue to eat pizzas or burritos regardless of the economy, making these predictable and resilient businesses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:28:00">[21:28:00]</a>. Chipotle, for example, can raise menu prices as food costs rise, and customers continue to find it a good value proposition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:38:00">[22:38:00]</a>.
*   **McDonald's:** During the 2008 crisis, McDonald's sales dropped only slightly, and its gross margins expanded due to its franchise model, where it earns royalties and rents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:45:00">[33:45:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="36:02:00">[36:02:00]</a>. This shows its resilience and pricing power.
*   [[importance_of_intrinsic_value_in_investing | See's Candies]]: Warren Buffett's investment in See's Candies exemplifies a perfect business prototype <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="41:05:00">[41:05:00]</a>. It's resistant to crises, easy to understand, requires minimal R&D, and has strong brand loyalty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="43:16:00">[43:16:00]</a>. This pricing power allowed See's to raise prices by 12 times since 1972, translating to 5-6% annual increases, far outpacing inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:52:00">[45:52:00]</a>. Buffett's $25 million investment yielded nearly $2 billion in pre-tax profits, multiplying his initial capital by 400 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="46:10:00">[46:10:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="47:05:00">[47:05:00]</a>.
*   **Lowe's Companies:** As a home improvement retailer, Lowe's benefits from inflation and real estate appreciation, as people tend to renovate homes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:15">[01:09:15]</a>. Its business largely relies on recurring maintenance rather than new construction, making it resilient during real estate downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:38">[01:09:38]</a>.
*   **Adobe and Oracle:** These software companies offer essential products (like PDF editors or database management) that businesses rely on, making them resistant to crises and able to raise prices without significant customer loss <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:37">[01:19:37]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:36:19">[01:36:19]</a>.

Conversely, commodity businesses like steel manufacturers (e.g., ArcelorMittal) are highly cyclical and sensitive to the economy, lacking strong pricing power and experiencing sharp declines in sales and profit margins during downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:44">[01:20:44]</a>.

## How to Assess a Business for [[asset_valuation_and_intrinsic_value | Valuation]]

To understand if a business is predictable, durable, and has pricing power, investors can follow these steps:

1.  **Review its Fundamentals During Crises:** Examine financial data (income, benefits) from past crises like 2008-2010 to see how the business performed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:55:00">[02:55:00]</a>. A business that performed well during severe downturns is likely resilient <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:42:00">[02:42:00]</a>.
2.  **Analyze its Stock Market Behavior:** While not technical analysis, consistent good performance over 10-15 years suggests a strong business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:10:00">[02:10:00]</a>. Look beyond short-term fluctuations of a year or two <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>.
3.  **Consider Customer Reaction to Price Changes (Pricing Power):** Think about how customers would react if the business raised its prices by 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:09:00">[02:09:00]</a>. Businesses with true pricing power, like Netflix or Microsoft, can increase prices without losing significant customers, directly boosting profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:19:54">[01:19:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:20:13">[01:20:13]</a>. In contrast, commodity-like businesses (e.g., gasoline sales) cannot, as customers will simply go to a competitor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.

## [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | Intrinsic Value]] and Long-Term Investing

[[importance_of_intrinsic_value_in_investing | Intrinsic value]] is the true worth of a business, based on its future earning potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:19">[01:12:19]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:26:00">[02:26:00]</a>. It's like a magnet that pulls stock prices over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:10">[01:14:10]</a>. Investors should aim to buy businesses below their intrinsic value to maximize returns and minimize risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:14:41">[01:14:41]</a>.

[[valuation_techniques_for_stocks_and_investment_strategies | Valuing businesses]] involves analyzing future earnings per share and comparing them to historical valuation ranges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:36">[01:06:36]</a>. This is not an exact science, but it provides a "range" or "magnet" for future value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:13:52">[01:13:52]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:00">[01:26:00]</a>.

[[value_investing_and_understanding_intrinsic_value | Value investing]] means focusing on predictable, durable businesses with pricing power, and buying them at a reasonable price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:00">[01:18:00]</a>. This strategy is more easily replicable for private investors than complex derivative strategies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:00:00">[05:00:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:00">[02:27:00]</a>.

A long-term perspective is key. Investors should focus on whether a business is generating value year after year (e.g., 15-20% more) rather than short-term stock price fluctuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:53">[01:45:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:54:00">[01:54:00]</a>. This requires patience and a good temperament to withstand [[understanding_stock_market_volatility_and_its_impact_on_stock_valuations | volatility]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:12:30">[02:12:30]</a>.

## Conclusion

[[importance_of_analyzing_stock_market_and_investment_opportunities | Learning to invest]] well means understanding how businesses work, interpreting financial results, and valuing companies based on their future potential rather than market speculation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:37:31">[01:37:31]</a>. It's about building a diversified portfolio of good, resilient businesses, purchased at sensible prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:05:58">[02:05:58]</a>, and adjusting positions when their [[valuation_of_stocks_and_market_dynamics | intrinsic value]] changes significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:07:48">[02:07:48]</a>. This grounded approach provides a more reliable path to long-term profitability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:28:19">[02:28:19]</a>.

The [[energy_and_transport_crises | energy crisis]] is identified as one of the four significant crises generating volatility in the economy and global stock markets in 2022 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This crisis profoundly affects everyone, from consumers to businesses, through rising costs and diminished disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:54">[00:18:54]</a>.

## Overview of the Crisis
The [[energy_and_transport_crises | energy crisis]] is characterized by a massive deficit in energy supply, impacting prices for gasoline, gas, and electricity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:57">[00:18:57]</a>. This deficit squeezes profit margins for companies and reduces consumers' disposable income <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:30">[00:20:30]</a>.

## Causes
Several factors contribute to the energy crisis:
*   **Discouragement of Oil Extraction** For several years, oil extraction was discouraged, as it was considered a "dirty energy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
*   **Penalized Financing** Financing costs for oil exploration and extraction projects have been significantly penalized <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:47">[00:19:47]</a>.
*   **Supply-Demand Imbalance** Despite reduced production, global energy consumption, approximately 100 million barrels per day, has remained constant, creating a supply deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Renewable Energy Limitations** Renewable energies, due to their higher cost and unpredictable nature (dependence on sun, wind), cannot compensate for this deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Geopolitical Factors
[[geopolitical_risks | Geopolitical tensions]] have exacerbated the [[energy_and_transport_crises | energy crisis]]:
*   **Middle East Tensions** Conflicts have been observed in areas like Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:11">[00:19:11]</a>.
*   **Russia-Ukraine Tensions** Russia, being one of the world's largest energy producers, is central to these tensions, further impacting global energy supply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.

These factors have caused oil prices to rise significantly, reaching levels not seen in seven years, with crude oil going from $59 to nearly $94 per barrel within a year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>. Similarly, electricity costs in Europe have multiplied by four to five times in recent months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:57">[00:20:57]</a>.

## Impact on Economy and Consumers
The rising energy costs directly contribute to [[energy_crisis_and_its_effect_on_inflation | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. For consumers, this means more money is spent on utilities, reducing disposable income for other consumption areas like leisure, clothes, or cars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_during_times_of_geopolitical_conflict | Investment Opportunities]] in the Energy Sector
Despite the challenges, certain companies and industries are benefiting from the [[energy_and_transport_crises | energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:29">[00:21:29]</a>. [[opportunities_and_risks_in_the_oil_market | Investing in assets that offer returns higher than inflation]] is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>.

Companies benefiting from the energy sector include:
*   **Integrated Energy Companies** Firms like Shell, Total, and BP, which manage extraction, refining, and distribution, benefit from rising energy prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Exploration Companies** Companies focused solely on exploration, such as Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ) and Tourmaline Oil Corp, have seen significant stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. CNQ, for example, nearly doubled its shares from $36 to $67 and offers a current profitability of 11% with a 3% dividend yield <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:22">[00:29:22]</a>.
*   **Oil and Gas Producers** Companies like Hipo (an international petroleum company) are trading at very low valuations relative to their cash flow, offering implied profitability in the current environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>.
*   **Service Providers** Companies like Schlumberger and National Oilwell Varco provide essential engineering support, components, and industrial consumables for energy extraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Refining and Transformation Companies** Firms that refine oil or gas into derivatives like kerosene or gasoline, such as Cheniere Energy (a major player in liquefied natural gas), benefit from higher selling prices of these derivatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>. Cheniere Energy holds a dominant position in the liquefied natural gas market due to its infrastructure for exporting US gas surplus <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:46">[00:33:46]</a>.
*   **Electrical Distribution Companies** These companies can pass on higher costs to consumers, benefiting from the rising electricity prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

The year 2022 has seen significant global volatility in the economy and stock markets, driven by four major crises, one of which is the [[energy_crisis_and_its_impact_on_inflation | energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. This crisis, deemed tremendously important, affects everyone as energy is consumed for daily needs like gasoline and heating, and companies face significant deficits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.

## Causes of the Energy Crisis

The [[energy_crisis_and_its_impact_on_inflation | energy crisis]] is primarily caused by a combination of factors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>:
*   **Geopolitical Tensions** [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | Geopolitical tensions and their economic impact]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:09">[00:19:09]</a>:
    *   Conflicts in the Middle East, specifically in Abu Dhabi and Saudi Arabia <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">[00:19:13]</a>.
    *   Tensions with Russia over Ukraine, as Russia is one of the largest global energy producers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:17">[00:19:17]</a>.
*   **Reduced Production and Investment**:
    *   Oil extraction was discouraged in previous years due to its classification as "dirty energy," leading to penalized financing costs for exploration and extraction projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:41">[00:19:41]</a>.
    *   Despite discouragement, global consumption remains around 100 million barrels per day, creating a deficit between production and demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>.
*   **Limitations of Renewables**: Renewable energies, while part of the solution, have higher costs and are not as predictable (dependent on sun and wind), making them unable to fully compensate for the deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:04">[00:20:04]</a>.

## Economic Impact

The combination of these factors, especially [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | geopolitical problems]], is generating tremendous costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:16">[00:20:16]</a>. Businesses are experiencing squeezed profit margins due to rising energy costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:29">[00:20:29]</a>.

Key impacts include:
*   **Rising Oil Prices** [[impact_of_rising_oil_prices_on_the_global_economy | Impact of rising oil prices on the global economy]]: In the last year, the price of oil surged from $59 to almost $94, levels not seen for seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:23">[00:19:23]</a>.
*   **Increased Electricity Costs**: In Europe, the cost of electricity multiplied by four to five times, rising from levels of 40-60 to 200 on an index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:54">[00:20:54]</a>.
*   **Inflation**: Higher energy costs directly contribute to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>.
*   **Reduced Consumer Disposable Income**: Consumers spend more on utilities, leaving less money for other consumption like restaurants, leisure, or clothes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:14">[00:21:14]</a>.

## Beneficiaries of the Energy Crisis

Despite the challenges, some companies and sectors are benefiting from the [[energy_and_raw_material_markets_under_geopolitical_tensions | energy crisis]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:58">[00:28:58]</a>:
*   **Energy Producers**: Companies that extract energy (oil, gas) benefit from rising prices. An example is Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ), one of Canada's largest energy producers, whose shares almost doubled, rising from $36 to $67 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:06">[00:29:06]</a>. They also offer dividend yields of 3% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:21">[00:30:21]</a>.
*   **Integrated Energy Companies**: Large companies like Shell, Total, or BP, which handle extraction, refining, and distribution (e.g., through gas stations), benefit across their operations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:28">[00:31:28]</a>.
*   **Oil and Gas Explorers**: Companies focused solely on exploration, like Tourmaline, are also well-managed and historically profitable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:46">[00:31:46]</a>.
*   **Energy Services and Suppliers**: Businesses providing engineering support, component parts, industrial consumables, power generators, or even accommodation services for workers in remote energy regions, also benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:01">[00:32:01]</a>.
*   **Refining and Transformation Companies (Midstream)**: Firms that refine oil or gas into derivatives like kerosene, gas, and gasoline see increased profit margins as the price of their end products rises. Cheniere Energy, focused on liquefied natural gas (LNG), holds a dominant market position in exporting U.S. gas surpluses, benefiting from infrastructure investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:42">[00:32:42]</a>.
*   **Electrical Distribution Companies**: These companies can raise prices for consumers, leading to increased profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:04">[00:34:04]</a>.

## Investment Considerations

In times of [[energy_and_raw_material_markets_under_geopolitical_tensions | geopolitical tensions]] and inflation, [[investment_strategies_during_economic_and_geopolitical_tensions | investment strategies]] should focus on assets that provide a return higher than inflation to protect purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:01">[00:30:01]</a>. Energy companies, especially those with stable costs, can expand profit margins significantly in the current high-price environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:27">[00:30:27]</a>.

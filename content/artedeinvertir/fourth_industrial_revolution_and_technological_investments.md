The "Great Economic Reset" proposes a new reform called the Fourth Industrial Revolution, which focuses on promoting new technologies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:00:00">[08:00:00]</a>. This initiative aims to foster innovation and technological development <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:24:00">[08:24:00]</a>.

## Promotion of Technology and Innovation

The agenda of the Davos Forum includes a full day dedicated exclusively to educating about this topic of the new technological revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:09:00">[08:09:00]</a>. These new measures are already being implemented <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:15:00">[08:15:00]</a>. For instance, the European Union's official website indicates that one of the main aids to be provided will be for innovation and technological development, planned at more than 140 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>. This forces governments and companies to spend this injection of money on new technological projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:30:00">[08:30:00]</a>.

## Impact on Stock Market and [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | Investment Opportunities]]

It is not surprising that the Nasdaq and [[disruptive_and_innovative_technologies_in_stock_investment | technology stocks]] have been among the best sectors in recent years on the stock market, benefiting tremendously from this Fourth Industrial Revolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:37:00">[08:37:00]</a>.

### Large American Technology Companies
Some of the most benefited stocks are those of large American technology companies such as Facebook, Google, or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:48:00">[08:48:00]</a>. Despite their recent rise, these companies are still listed at reasonable valuations given their high profits and good prospects for future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. Furthermore, a possible tax increase in the US would not affect them as negatively as other local companies, as a large part of their taxes are declared abroad <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:04:00">[09:04:00]</a>.

### [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_technology_and_energy_sectors | Qualcomm]]
As an [[examples_of_investment_opportunities_in_affected_sectors | example of an investment opportunity]], Qualcomm (ticker QCOM) is a major American technology company listed at $160 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:21:00">[09:21:00]</a>. It is considered one of the best technology companies globally due to its high-quality products and dominant market position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:30:00">[09:30:00]</a>. Qualcomm is a leading manufacturer of microchips and processors, primarily for smartphones, known for its Snapdragon processors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:41:00">[09:41:00]</a>. The company holds over 140,000 patents worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:51:00">[09:51:00]</a>.

The "Great Economic Reset" seeks to promote 5G technology for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:56:00">[09:56:00]</a>, and Qualcomm is well-positioned to leverage this new phase of growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:00:00">[10:00:00]</a>. The company also generates significant income through royalties by licensing its patents <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:07:00">[10:07:00]</a>.

To value its shares, using free cash flow is appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:15:00">[10:15:00]</a>. Qualcomm is expected to produce around $9 billion in free cash flow, placing its current valuation at approximately 20 times earnings, which is below the market average for a high-quality, high-growth company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:22:00">[10:22:00]</a>. With a moderate growth assumption of 10% per year for the next 3-5 years and trading at least at 25 times earnings, its target value could reach over $250, presenting an interesting realization potential compared to its current trading price of $160 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:36:00">[10:36:00]</a>.

### Equinix
Another [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_technology_and_energy_sectors | investment opportunity]] in the technology sector is Equinix (ticker EQIX), listed in the US at $770 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:33:00">[11:33:00]</a>. Equinix operates as a Real Estate Investment Trust (REIT), which benefits from a special tax regime in the US: if it pays the majority of its profits in dividends to shareholders, it does not pay corporate taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:41:00">[11:41:00]</a>. This means that a tax increase on traditional companies in the US would not affect Equinix, as its tax regime is not expected to be modified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:54:00">[11:54:00]</a>.

While REITs typically buy and rent properties, Equinix has found an interesting market niche related to technology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>. It specializes in building and renting data centers that house large processors for storing and processing information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>. Many of its clients are large technology companies such as Google, [[microsoft_and_technology_investment | Microsoft]], or Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:23:00">[12:23:00]</a>.

Equinix is expected to benefit tremendously in the coming years from the Fourth Industrial Revolution proposed by the "Great Economic Reset," as the amount of data processed and transported via the internet will increase exponentially, and Equinix provides this essential infrastructure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:31:00">[12:31:00]</a>. Its adjusted profits (FFO) have tripled in less than six years, from $700 million in 2014 to $2.1 billion last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:44:00">[12:44:00]</a>.

The shares are currently trading at a demanding valuation of around 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:04:00">[13:04:00]</a>. However, this is justified by the high [[predictable_and_stable_business_investments | predictability of the business]] and practically assured growth for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:07:00">[13:07:00]</a>. With an expected growth of at least 15% in a three-to-five-year view, its value could reach $1,400, representing a very interesting potential for realization compared to its current $770 trading price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:16:00">[13:16:00]</a>.

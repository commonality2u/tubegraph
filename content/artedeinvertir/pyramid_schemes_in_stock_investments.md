The world of [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market investments]] has seen a surge in popularity, attracting not only legitimate investors but also unscrupulous individuals seeking to defraud others through complex deception techniques <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:41">[00:00:41]</a>. One dangerous scam becoming increasingly prevalent involves pyramid schemes and multilevel systems applied to the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>.

## How Pyramid Schemes Work in Investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>

In these schemes, the product or service offered is often merely an excuse to comply with the law and avoid raising suspicions of deception <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>.

### Promises to New Investors

Scammers initiate the pyramid by promising future investors two things <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>:
*   Their capital will be completely safe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>.
*   They will receive high returns, such as 1% daily or 15% monthly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>.

These favorable conditions make it easy to attract people to deposit money into the pyramid <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

### Operational Mechanics

Once initial investors are on board, two additional conditions are typically established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>:
1.  **Capital Lock-in**: Money must be invested in the network for a minimum period, often 3, 6, or 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
2.  **Recruitment Incentives**: Investors are promised exponentially higher benefits if they bring new people into the network <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:55">[00:03:55]</a>. This is because the system relies on new capital constantly entering <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:04">[00:04:04]</a>.

The core secret of these systems is that by blocking the money of new participants, they can pay old participants who wish to withdraw <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This mechanism provides credibility to the system, as initial investors can indeed withdraw their funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:15">[00:04:15]</a>. Often, however, investors do not withdraw because they believe they are "earning" fictitious money, allowing the pyramid to grow and affect thousands of people <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:25">[00:04:25]</a>.

### Irrelevant Investments

In these schemes, the actual investments made are entirely irrelevant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. Scammers frequently use trendy assets like cryptocurrencies, gold, or certain [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | stocks]] as a facade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. However, the money is not genuinely invested in these assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:49">[00:04:49]</a>. Victims are usually given fake keys and access to manipulated online platforms that show their invested money "growing" non-stop, but this data is not real <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>.

## Collapse of Pyramid Schemes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>

Pyramid schemes invariably end the same way <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>. When more capital leaves the network than enters, a panic ensues because old investors cannot be paid the promised benefits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">[00:05:07]</a>. Everyone then tries to withdraw their money, realizing the scam, and discovering that their money is gone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>.

### Case Study: Forum Filatelico and Afinsa

In Spain, schemes like Forum Filatelico and Afinsa were created under the guise of investing in stamps and art <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:28">[00:05:28]</a>. These scams affected over 190,000 people and swindled more than 2.5 billion euros <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>.

## Warnings and Recommendations

*   **Avoid Key Terms**: If you encounter terms like "network marketing," "multilevel marketing networks," or "pyramids," it's advisable to disengage immediately <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Historical Illegality**: Pyramid schemes have existed for over 100 years and are illegal in most countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>. They adapt to laws by linking a product or service as an excuse to continue operating <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>.
*   **Beware of Unrealistic Promises**: Be wary of anyone promising high returns on the [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] without risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. This simply does not exist <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:11">[00:06:11]</a>.
*   **Recruitment as a Red Flag**: Your distrust should be even greater if, in addition to high returns, you are required to attract new people to the "business opportunity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:15">[00:06:15]</a>.
*   **Regulation is Key**: If you choose a company to invest your money, ensure it is regulated by the highest [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | stock market]] authority in your country <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. For example, in Spain, this would be the CNMV <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:33">[00:06:33]</a>.
*   **Guard Against Greed**: The most important thing to avoid falling victim to these scammers is not letting yourself be swayed by greed and remembering that no one will give you something for nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:30">[00:14:30]</a>.

Economist and investor [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] has predicted an unprecedented economic recession brought about by a "new world order" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a>. He believes this recession will be primarily due to three new problems for which the world is unprepared <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. According to Dalio, these challenges are the most significant of our lives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:16">[00:00:16]</a>. He suggests an economic war is brewing that will lead to the decline of the United States and its allies, favoring China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:21">[00:00:21]</a>.

[[ray_dalios_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] has indicated that the economic outlook will change drastically, with significant consequences for the value of money, investments, and currencies like the dollar <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:30">[00:00:30]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Background and Influence
[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] possesses significant global economic influence and power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. He is a regular attendee at the Davos forum meetings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">[00:01:17]</a> and founded the world's largest hedge fund, managing over $100 trillion in assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. Dalio is highly respected in financial markets for successfully navigating major [[economic_crisis_predictions_by_ray_dalio | economic crises]], such as those in 2000 and 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>. He recently summarized this new economic scenario in his book, *The New World Order* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

## The Three Major Forces Driving Economic Change
In a recent interview with CNBC, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions_and_their_implications | Ray Dalio]] described three forces as the greatest he has witnessed in his lifetime <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. Historically, the simultaneous occurrence of these three problems has led to [[ray_dalios_predictions_on_economic_crisis | economic recessions]] and major changes that have ended empires and influenced main world currencies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:03">[00:02:03]</a>.

### 1. Class Struggle and Social Gap
The first problem identified by [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] is the class struggle between capitalism and communism, representing "those who have and those who don't" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a>. Both sides are determined to win, leading to an increasing social gap between classes and future tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">[00:02:24]</a>. Data shows that 1% of the American population owns increasingly more wealth, while the poorest 50% owns less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">[00:02:33]</a>. The recent inflation crisis has exacerbated this disparity, disproportionately affecting those who do not own assets like stocks or real estate, which offer protection against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:43">[00:02:43]</a>.

### 2. Enormous Debt Bubble
The second problem is the immense debt burden carried by both the United States and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:16">[00:03:16]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] notes a decreasing demand for United States debt, considering American bonds a very risky investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. He posits two potential outcomes: either interest rates for debt will rise, or states will resort to printing more money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. Printing more money to address recessions would lead to higher inflation, further widening the social gap between classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">[00:03:37]</a>.

### 3. Rise of China and Decline of the United States
The third concern is the ascendance of China and the anticipated decline of the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:35">[00:04:35]</a>. This shift would significantly impact the value of the dollar and its status as a global reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:41">[00:04:41]</a>. [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] suggests that the United States, having dominated the international political landscape for the past 70 years by controlling institutions like the United Nations and the International Monetary Fund, is nearing a change <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. He illustrates the United States entering a "decline phase" characterized by high debt levels, social struggles, and currency devaluation, while China is in an "ascending phase" of wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>.

## Dalio's Predicted Timeline
[[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] predicts that "in 5 years we will see a totally different world than the current one" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. This transformation will be driven by the rise of China, the class struggle, the debt bubble, and technological changes like Artificial Intelligence, which can create unpredictable scenarios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:58">[00:03:58]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Recommendations for Investors
In response to these complex challenges, [[ray_dalios_economic_predictions | Ray Dalio]] offers the following recommendations for small investors:

### 1. Invest Globally to Combat Inflation
Investors should view their investments globally and prioritize preventing their money from losing value due to inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:25">[00:05:25]</a>. He emphasizes that investing is the only way to do this, noting that the value of assets like stocks and gold has risen due to the creation of new debt and money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:31">[00:05:31]</a>. [[ray_dalios_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] strongly advises against holding what may seem "safe," such as liquidity, fixed income, or traditional bonds, as their value will likely decrease in inflationary environments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. Instead, real assets with consistent demand, such as stocks, real estate investments, or gold, are expected to perform better <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:10">[00:06:10]</a>.

### 2. Diversify for Risk Reduction
In a world with significant uncertainty and risks, it is crucial to learn to diversify without reducing performance expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>. Good diversification can reduce risk by as much as 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>. [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] has consistently recommended investing the majority of a portfolio in both national and international stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:35">[00:06:35]</a>. He popularized the "Four Seasons" portfolio management theory <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>.

### Current Investment Preferences
Based on his recent portfolio, [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]]'s preferred investment sector is technology, with holdings in companies like Google, Facebook, Microsoft, and Visa <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Conversely, he has been selling positions in the banking sector, including Bank of America and JP Morgan, as these are sensitive to the economic cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:05">[00:07:05]</a>. While [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] typically holds a significant portion of his portfolio in long-term debt or bonds, his main current positions are in stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:33">[00:07:33]</a>.

Another sector favored by [[ray_dalios_stock_market_predictions | Ray Dalio]] in this environment is stable or defensive consumer companies, such as Procter & Gamble, Walmart, Coca-Cola, and Pepsi <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:45">[00:07:45]</a>. He has also invested in the Russell 2000 small caps ETF (IWM), which includes 2,000 small-cap companies in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>. Historically, small-cap stocks tend to perform better than the market average and large companies when interest rates drop and liquidity increases in the system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

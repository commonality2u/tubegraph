A new risk for the stock market, termed the "reverse crisis," is emerging, posing significant implications for investors [00:00:03]. This scenario, increasingly likely, has been warned about by prominent investors like Warren Buffett, Bill Ackman, and Stanley Druckenmiller [00:00:24]. Understanding its causes and consequences is crucial for protecting capital and savings [00:00:12].

## Understanding the Reverse Financial Crisis
A reverse financial crisis is intrinsically linked to [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflation]] and the monetary decisions made by central banks and governments [00:00:59].

### Causes of Inflation
Central banks, such as the Federal Reserve, have consistently flooded the financial system with new money, a practice observed since the 2008 financial crisis [00:01:05]. As an example, 22% of the total U.S. dollars currently in circulation were printed in the single year of 2020 to address the crisis [00:01:23].

Governments are increasingly accustomed to spending more money than they collect through taxes, leading to increased borrowing and national debt [00:01:33]. This practice weakens currency and generates more [[inflation impact on investment portfolios | inflation]] [00:01:40]. The U.S. deficit, for instance, has reached an impressive 8%, nearing levels seen during the 2008 crisis [00:01:46]. These factors have contributed to one of the largest [[Impact of inflation on the market | inflation crises]] in the last 40 years [00:01:53].

### The Nature of a Reverse Crisis
In a reverse crisis, similar to the price of products and services, investments can experience a dizzying climb that appears endless [00:02:07]. While this might seem positive at first glance, it is inherently dangerous [00:02:19].

This type of crisis has already occurred in major stock markets in countries such as Germany, Argentina, and Turkey [00:02:24].
*   The Merval index in Argentina multiplied by 60 times in five years [00:02:31].
*   The Turkish stock market saw a 700% rise in just five years [00:02:36].
*   Germany experienced an 800% rise in less than two years [00:02:41].

### Nominal vs. Real Returns
To grasp the concept of an inverse financial crisis, it's essential to understand the distinction between nominal and real returns [00:02:46].
*   **Nominal Return:** The stated percentage increase in an investment. For example, an investment rising from $10,000 to $11,000 yields a 10% nominal return [00:02:51].
*   **Real Return:** The nominal return adjusted for [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]]. If the nominal return is 10% but [[inflation impact on investment portfolios | inflation]] is 15% over the same period, the real return is a negative 5% [00:02:59]. This means a loss of purchasing power because the price of services and products increased faster than the value of the money invested [00:03:13].

This loss of purchasing power is a "silent problem" that many people ignore until it is too late [00:03:22]. Those with less financial literacy often suffer the most, bearing the full cost of [[inflation impact on investment portfolios | inflation]] without the benefit of investments [00:03:31].

Since 2021, accumulated [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] has reached 20% due to government and central bank policies [00:03:56]. The S&P 500 index, trading around 4800 points in 2021, would have needed to reach 5700 points to compensate for this 20% [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] [00:04:06]. However, it is currently trading at 5200 points, representing a 10% loss in purchasing power for investors [00:04:25]. While this is a better outcome than not investing (which would result in a 20% loss of purchasing power), [[Impact of inflation and interest rates on investments | inflation]] continues to rise, further eroding purchasing power [00:04:44]. This effect is contributing to main stock market indices reaching historical highs [00:04:54].

### Role of Real Interest Rates
These processes are closely tied to [[Impact of inflation and interest rates on investments | negative real interest rates]], which occur when the level of [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] surpasses the interest rate set by a country's central bank [00:05:10].
*   In Argentina, the average real interest rate was negative by at least 6% over 12 years, contributing to one of the worst [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflation crises]] in its history [00:05:23].
*   Europe and the United States experienced negative real rates of 3-4% during 2021 and 2022, though for a shorter period (12-24 months) [00:05:37].

A significant concern among many large investors is the potential for a second, higher wave of [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] [00:05:55]. Historically, when the Fed lowers rates, it tends to cause [[Impact of inflation on investments | inflation]] to rise, as observed in the 1970s [00:06:12]. According to a study by the Apollo Group, a new increase in [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] and negative real interest rates could be seen in 12 to 24 months [00:06:26].

Governments continue to face the problem of fiscal deficits, spending more than they earn [00:06:44]. Warren Buffett has warned about the consequences of "huge and entrenched fiscal deficits" and the potential future risk of "extreme [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]]" [00:07:01].

## [[Investment Strategies during inflationary periods | Investment Strategies During Inflationary Periods]]
In environments of [[Impact of inflation and interest rates on investments | negative real interest rates]], [[Investment strategies during inflationary periods | investing]] in stocks has historically been more logical, as bonds tend to suffer, leading to a near-certain reduction in purchasing power [00:07:35]. However, not all stocks perform equally well.

### Strategies for Navigating Inflation
There are primarily two approaches to [[Investment strategies during inflationary cycles | investing]] during inflationary periods:

1.  **Investing in Inflation-Benefiting Sectors:**
    If high [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] is anticipated, sectors like gold miners or companies in the real estate sector (REITs) tend to perform well [00:07:53].
    *   According to Bank of America, bonds are the only [[Investment strategies during inflationary periods | investment]] category that consistently shows negative returns relative to [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] [00:08:03].
    *   However, these sectors often have lower quality businesses with higher volatility, typically underperforming the market average unless specific inflationary situations occur [00:08:18].

2.  **Investing in Companies with Pricing Power (Warren Buffett's Approach):**
    Warren Buffett suggests that the best businesses to own during an [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] crisis are those that require little capital [[Investment opportunities during inflation | investment]] and possess strong brands or competitive advantages [00:08:45].
    *   **Pricing Power:** This key characteristic allows companies to raise prices at a rate equal to or greater than the increase in [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]] and their costs [00:09:02].
    *   This enables profits to rise faster than [[Inflation and its impact on investments | inflation]], protecting the [[investment_opportunities_during_inflation | investment]] from its erosive effects [00:09:14].
    *   These businesses also tend to deliver consistent and predictable returns in non-crisis environments, meaning investors do not need to predict economic or central bank decisions [00:09:26].

### Examples of Companies with Pricing Power
A list compiled by Credit Suisse identifies 25 large-cap stocks with significant pricing power, including iconic names with strong brands [00:10:03]:
*   Walmart [00:10:14]
*   Microsoft [00:10:16]
*   Campbell [00:10:17]
*   Philip Morris [00:10:17]
*   Dollar General [00:10:18]
*   Lockheed Martin [00:10:19]

Many of these companies have been invested in by Warren Buffett and have shown strong performance over recent decades in the stock market [00:10:21].

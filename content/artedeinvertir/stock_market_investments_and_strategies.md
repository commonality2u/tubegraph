Warren Buffett has stated that the next crisis is inevitable and has provided new tips on how to adapt to inflation and other risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:07">[00:00:07]</a>. His advice is useful for anyone investing in the [[stock_market_investing_strategies | stock market]] or dealing with inflation, as inflation affects everyone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>. Without investing, money is devalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Crisis and Inflation Warnings

Warren Buffett noted that "substantial price increases" are occurring due to inflation and are being accepted globally, with steel prices rising daily and the economy being "very overheated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:07">[00:02:07]</a>. He has warned that inflation is, and will continue to be, higher than people anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. A second wave of inflation is expected in 2023 when wages rise, updated with 2022's high inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

### Currency Devaluation and Debt

The easiest solution to current economic problems will be the devaluation of the dollar and the euro <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. Holding dollars, euros, or [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] in liquidity, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits is "very bad news" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Governments use inflation to increase their income, as they charge a percentage on economic activity, while their debt levels do not increase with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

Over the last 100 years, the dollar has lost practically 99% of its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. For example, in the 1970s, $6.30 could buy 17 oranges, while today, that amount buys far less <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. In 2020, one dollar buys only a basic McDonald's hamburger or coffee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:54">[00:04:54]</a>. Ninety years ago, $20 bought 670 dozen eggs, compared to only 10 dozen today in the U.S. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:06">[00:05:06]</a>.

> [!WARNING] The trick of inflation is that while the nominal amount in your account remains the same, the purchasing power of your money is significantly lower <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.

### Wealth Transfer

The situation stemming from the confinement (COVID-19 pandemic) has resulted in the "largest transfer of wealth in history," effectively a "gigantic robbery of the middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. Fiscal stimuli and new money printed by central banks are financed by new debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. The middle class will ultimately pay this debt through taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a>.

This money benefits companies that offer services like infrastructure building (e.g., roads) and digitalization plans, which are then reflected in the [[stock_market_trends_and_investment_strategies | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Companies are better positioned to resist inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:08">[00:09:08]</a>. Those who hold productive assets like [[stock_market_investing_strategies | investments in the stock market]] are the ones who benefit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

> [!NOTE] "All actions have consequences. We can't wait that if we print money and nothing happens... that is the solution to this crisis" â€” Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>.

The tremendous printing of money has caused debt levels in the world's four main economies to rise from 15 trillion to 25 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:08">[00:10:08]</a>.

## Adapting to Inflation: Warren Buffett's Investment Advice

The only way to protect oneself in the current economic environment is through [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investment]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

### Investing in Productive Assets vs. Fixed Income and Gold

Warren Buffett advises against traditional "conservative" investments like bank deposits, bonds, or treasury bills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>. He compares buying a 10-year bond yielding 2% to paying 50 times earnings for a business that won't grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:00">[00:16:00]</a>. In contrast, businesses like Visa, trading at 28 times earnings, offer an immediate return of 3% but also grow profits by over 10%, leading to a combined annual profitability of around 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>.

> [!WARNING] Conservative fixed income [[types_of_stocks_and_investment_strategies | investments]] and deposits have a "very complicated future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.

Warren Buffett also warns against investing in gold. He states that an ounce of gold will always remain an ounce of gold, producing nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Productive assets like stocks, real estate (houses, apartments), or farmland, which generate dividends or income, are superior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. While gold tends to retain its value in inflationary times because it cannot be printed like fiat money, productive assets multiply <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.

### Characteristics of Desirable Businesses

Warren Buffett recommends investing in "fabulous businesses" that:
*   Generate "tons of cash flow" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.
*   "Do not require capital," meaning they require low levels of reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:47">[00:14:47]</a>.
*   Are disciplined in not issuing excessive shares, or even better, buy back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

His own investment history during periods of galloping inflation (1970s and 1980s) shows substantial returns (e.g., 22% average annual return in the 70s, 40% in the 80s) from investing in companies that met these criteria, not primarily gold or oil <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:43">[00:12:43]</a>.

### Investing in Oneself

Beyond financial [[strategies_for_stock_market_investment | strategies]], Warren Buffett advises people to "invest in yourself" and improve skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:39">[00:20:39]</a>. The best [[stock_investment_advice | investment]] one can make is in education to increase one's skills in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:11">[00:21:11]</a>.

## Recent Warren Buffett Investments and Examples

Warren Buffett has recently made significant acquisitions, including 12 billion dollars in shares last week, and another almost 5 billion in HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. His chosen companies, like HP, are not raw materials, gold, or energy firms, but rather technology companies with specific characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

### HP (Hewlett-Packard)

HP is a large company with a market capitalization of $40 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. It generates substantial cash flow (e.g., $6 billion in 2021-2022) but requires low reinvestment (around 10% of earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:02">[00:26:02]</a>. This is crucial because low reinvestment means inflation has less impact on capital expenditure <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:26">[00:26:26]</a>. HP also actively buys back shares, withdrawing around 15% of the company's stock in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:31">[00:27:31]</a>. This "cannibalization" benefits long-term shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:11">[00:28:11]</a>.

While HP's printer division is in decline, its personal computer and peripherals division is growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:40">[00:29:40]</a>. The printing segment, though highly profitable, constitutes only a small portion of the company's total <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:40">[00:30:40]</a>. HP currently trades at around 8 times earnings, and through share buybacks alone, earnings per share could increase significantly even with zero company growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:16">[00:31:16]</a>.

### Occidental Petroleum (Oxy)

Warren Buffett also invested in Occidental Petroleum (Oxy) after listening to their conference call, where management emphasized share buybacks as a channel for the company's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:41">[00:28:41]</a>. Other major holdings of Buffett like Apple, Moody's, and Bank of America also systematically buy back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:09">[00:29:09]</a>.

### Starbucks

Starbucks, with its recent price drop, also exhibits desirable characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:25">[00:32:25]</a>. It is a good business that can raise prices and requires little reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. The return of its founding CEO, Howard Schultz, historically led to significant stock rallies after previous drops <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:00">[00:34:00]</a>.

Despite rising coffee prices (raw material), Starbucks' profit margins are high because the cost of coffee is a small fraction of the final price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. This allows the company to absorb cost increases or raise prices without significantly impacting demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:18">[00:36:18]</a>. Starbucks consistently grows revenue, expands margins, and maintains healthy profits even during crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:05">[00:37:05]</a>. It reinvests around 20% of its earnings and has historically traded at 25-30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:46">[00:37:46]</a>.

### CH Robinson

CH Robinson is a logistics broker that acts as an intermediary, connecting companies needing transport with transport providers <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. It does not own trucks or airplanes, so its costs are low <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:16">[00:40:16]</a>. This business model is highly protected against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. As transportation rates rise due to inflation (e.g., higher truck driver salaries, rising oil prices), CH Robinson, charging a percentage on these rising rates, benefits from higher revenue without a proportional increase in its own costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:20">[00:41:20]</a>.

The logistics broker market is growing, with CH Robinson increasing its market share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:48">[00:42:48]</a>. These businesses have strong competitive advantages due to their established networks and technological platforms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:20">[00:43:20]</a>. CH Robinson generated $1 billion in cash flow in 2021 but only reinvested $94 million (9.4%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:50">[00:47:50]</a>.

### Google (Alphabet)

Google exhibits characteristics favored by Warren Buffett: high cash flow and low reinvestment requirements <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:58">[00:50:58]</a>. For instance, in 2024, it is estimated to earn $146 billion but only reinvest $34 billion (around 20-25%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. Google also engages in significant share buybacks, repurchasing $50 billion in shares last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:30">[00:51:30]</a>. The price of Google's stock shows a "tremendous correlation" with its normalized earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:56">[00:51:56]</a>.

### MTI GTM (Franchise Business Model)

Companies with a franchise model, like MTI GTM, benefit from inflation without incurring significant costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. They receive royalties based on franchisee sales. If inflation causes menu prices to rise, MTI GTM's percentage-based revenue increases without a corresponding rise in their operational costs (e.g., food ingredients) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. This results in very high profit margins (e.g., 24% EBITDA) and extremely low reinvestment needs (e.g., $6 million reinvested on $140 million cash flow in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>. The company also buys back shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:52">[00:59:52]</a>.

### Other Notable Examples and Concepts

*   **Darling Ingredients / Givaudan**: Businesses that manufacture ingredients, especially in specialized markets, often compete on reputation and have high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:12">[00:56:12]</a>. They can raise prices with inflation while their costs do not rise proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:55">[00:56:55]</a>.
*   **Teamviewer**: A software company with a subscription-based, recurrent business model, high margins, low reinvestment, and little debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:09:09">[01:09:09]</a>. However, it's crucial to avoid overpaying for a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:17">[01:17:17]</a>.
*   **Micron**: An example of a cyclical business (e.g., RAM memories) where revenues and profits fluctuate significantly, making investment more complex due to high volatility and high reinvestment needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:01">[01:01:01]</a>.
*   **Iberdrola (Utilities)**: While utility companies can raise electricity prices with inflation to maintain profits, they require substantial reinvestment (e.g., 70% of operating profit), which limits profit growth during inflationary periods <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:17:49">[01:17:49]</a>.
*   **Global Payments (POS Terminals)**: An oligopoly sector where a few companies control the market, creating barriers to entry and allowing for high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:42">[01:10:42]</a>.

> [!INFO] **Key Takeaway**: When [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | analyzing stock market investments]], focus on companies that generate strong cash flow, require minimal capital reinvestment, possess competitive advantages, and preferably engage in share buybacks. This approach aligns with Warren Buffett's [[investment_strategies_and_portfolio_management | investment strategies]] for navigating inflationary environments.

The current crisis has intensified, leading many investors to question the possibility of a new crisis in 2021 after a challenging preceding year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:02">[00:00:02]</a>. Prominent investors like Warren Buffett, Stanley Druckenmiller, and Michael Burry have issued messages of caution to investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. This article outlines new [[current_economic_risks_and_their_impact_on_the_stock_market | risks]] that could affect both the economy and the [[economic_indicators_and_their_impact_on_stock_markets | stock market]] over the next year, strategies for protection, and examples of high-growth investment opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

## Key Risk Factors

### New Problem Variant and Uncertainty
Recent news indicates that the current global problem has mutated and could transmit at a faster rate, causing panic among investors about a potential new crisis in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">[00:00:54]</a>. The immediate reaction has included flight cancellations, border closures, and new containment measures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">[00:01:06]</a>. Stocks most affected in the markets are those related to the crisis, such as airlines, hotels, and catering companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. Monitoring the evolution of this situation is crucial, as the effectiveness of current remedies against the new variant is uncertain, and uncertainty is generally detrimental to the economy and the [[stock_market_fluctuations_and_potential_crisis | stock market]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:20">[00:01:20]</a>.

### Inadequate Economic Stimulus Measures
Further exacerbating the situation, new economic stimulus measures approved in the US were significantly lower than anticipated, around $900 billion, while the market expected double this amount <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:36">[00:01:36]</a>. These economic stimulus measures and the Federal Reserve's actions were vital for the recovery in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>.

Warren Buffett, known for his moderate message, urged the American government to increase stimulus measures to avert [[impact_of_recession_on_stock_market_and_investments | economic disaster]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:00">[00:02:00]</a>.

> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:13">[00:02:13]</a> "Congress is in the process of ruining the dreams of thousands of people. Congress needs to act now. We need another injection of money to complete the job. Congress is currently debating, and I hope they extend the PPP program on a large scale to allow people to see the light at the end of the tunnel."

Buffett emphasizes the critical importance of providing liquidity to both families and corporations during times of stress <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:34">[00:02:34]</a>.

### Market Euphoria and Speculation
Stanley Druckenmiller, a highly admired investor, has expressed concern about current market conditions, describing them as "absolute euphoria" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>. He suggests that while everyone enjoys a party, a hangover often follows, indicating that the next 3 to 5 years could be "very, very complicated" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>. Bull markets typically conclude when euphoria emerges, and several indicators suggest the market might be nearing this phase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

One significant sign of current market euphoria is that the traded volume of options has, for the first time, exceeded the traded volume of shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Options are leveraged investment instruments that involve debt, meaning their value rises much faster when the market increases but falls significantly more, potentially losing all value, during market downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. In times of greed or euphoria, options become the preferred tool for speculators seeking rapid wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:19">[00:04:19]</a>. Goldman Sachs data shows that the volume of traded options has reached record levels, hitting figures of $400 billion over the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>.

Joel Greenblatt, an investor with annual returns exceeding 30% for over 30 years, has also warned of significant market euphoria <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>. He highlighted a "chilling fact" about the current euphoria:
> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a> "If in 2020 you had bought every company that lost money in 2019 and that has a [[stock_market_risks_and_bubbles | stock market]] capitalization greater than a billion dollars, you would be earning an impressive 65%."

Companies are expected to produce profits to justify their valuation, but in times of euphoria, these basic principles are often overlooked, leading to the anomaly where companies that lost more money performed better on the [[stock_market_volatility_and_the_impact_of_global_events | stock market]] in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:38">[00:05:38]</a>. Historically, consistently investing in companies that lose money typically results in negative or significantly lower returns than the market average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:58">[00:05:58]</a>. However, not all companies with business-level losses are bad investments, as they can eventually become profitable, like Amazon or Netflix <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:28">[00:06:28]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in High-Growth Stocks

### Valuation Method for High-Growth Companies with Losses
A three-step method can be applied to value high-growth companies that are currently producing losses:

1.  **Estimate Future Sales:** Project sales in three to five years, assuming a growth rate lower than current levels, as growth tends to slow with scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:38">[00:07:38]</a>. For example, if a company is growing at 40%, assume 30% for future projections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:54">[00:07:54]</a>.
2.  **Determine Future Profit Margins:** Assess what profit margins the company could achieve in its maturity phase by looking at comparable mature companies in the same sector (e.g., Toyota/Volkswagen for auto, Microsoft/Google for tech) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. This provides the future profit figure, which is then divided by shares outstanding for earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:34">[00:08:34]</a>.
3.  **Apply a Profit Multiplier:** Apply an appropriate price-to-earnings (P/E) multiplier based on the industry and expected future growth (e.g., 30-40x for high-growth tech, 15-20x for more cyclical industries like automotive) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.

#### Case Study: Nio (NIV)
Nio, listed in the US under the ticker NIV at $48 per share, is considered the Chinese version of Tesla and has multiplied by over 12 times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>. Nio had losses in the last 12 months but experienced exceptional stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>.

*   **Future Sales (Step 1):** Estimates project $47 billion in sales for the next two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">[00:09:09]</a>. Let's assume $50 billion for future sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins (Step 2):** Based on mature auto companies like Volkswagen or Toyota, Nio could achieve net profit margins around 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. This implies potential net profits of $3 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>. Dividing by total shares, future earnings per share could be around $2 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:47">[00:09:47]</a>.
*   **Valuation Multiple (Step 3):** The automotive sector typically trades at around 10 times profits, but with higher growth, 15-20 times could be justified <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. Multiplying $2 future profit per share by 15x yields an intrinsic valuation of approximately $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

This suggests Nio is currently trading above its fair value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:21">[00:10:21]</a>. However, if Nio reaches $100 billion in sales, it could yield $4 profit per share, potentially reaching $80 with a 15-20x multiple <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>.

#### Case Study: Tesla (TSLA)
Tesla, listed under TSLA at $680 per share, is one of the most popular stocks, multiplying by over seven times in 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>. It had losses in 2019 but started generating profits in 2020, partly due to its inclusion in the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>.

Michael Burry, known from "The Big Short," has declared he is investing against Tesla due to its high valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. He tweeted, advising Elon Musk to issue a large amount of shares to strengthen Tesla's balance sheet <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>. Burry noted that Tesla's capitalization (over $600 billion) exceeds all other traditional automobile manufacturers combined, despite generating only 1% of the industry's total profit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:26">[00:12:26]</a>. Bloomberg compared market value per vehicle produced: electric vehicle companies like Nio are valued at over $1.6 million per vehicle, and Tesla at over $1 million, whereas traditional manufacturers like Volkswagen ($10,000), Toyota ($25,000), and BMW ($26,000) have significantly lower valuations per vehicle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>.

Investing against a stock can be extremely dangerous and requires significant experience <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:36">[00:13:36]</a>. While Tesla currently generates low profits, it has the capacity to increase them drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:44">[00:13:44]</a>.

#### Case Study: Palantir Technologies (PLTR)
Palantir, listed under PLTR at $30 per share, has more than tripled since its listing at $10 three months prior <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:04">[00:14:04]</a>. It is a high-growth technology company specializing in analyzing large amounts of data to anticipate threats <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:20">[00:14:20]</a>. Palantir is also in a phase of producing losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:32">[00:14:32]</a>.

*   **Future Sales (Step 1):** Expected to invoice around $1.4 billion in 2021 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:44">[00:14:44]</a>. Conservatively, assuming 40% annual growth (less than current 50%), it could generate sales of $7.5 billion in five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:52">[00:14:52]</a>.
*   **Profit Margins (Step 2):** Mature technology companies like Microsoft, Oracle, or Google generate 20-25% profits on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:05">[00:15:05]</a>. This suggests potential profits for Palantir of $1.8 billion annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:22">[00:15:22]</a>. Dividing by 1.75 billion shares, earnings per share could be $1 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:28">[00:15:28]</a>.
*   **Valuation Multiple (Step 3):** For the less cyclical, higher-quality technology sector, a 30x earnings multiplier could be applied, similar to Google, Microsoft, or Oracle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:36">[00:15:36]</a>. This results in a fair value of around $30 per share for Palantir <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">[00:15:54]</a>.

The current stock price largely incorporates future benefit expectations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:59">[00:15:59]</a>. This simplified valuation method has a wide range of possibilities, and a strong conviction in sustained high growth could justify a higher intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:07">[00:16:07]</a>.

#### Case Study: Alibaba (BABA)
Alibaba, listed under BABA at $200 per share, faces recent scrutiny from the Chinese government due to an investigation into alleged monopolistic practices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:35">[00:16:35]</a>. Some media suggest this is a message to founder Jack Ma, who has been critical of the Communist Party's policies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:53">[00:16:53]</a>. In jurisdictions with fewer investor rights, such actions can lead to company value losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:03">[00:17:03]</a>.

Financially, Alibaba's current valuation is attractive, trading at less than 17 times earnings, with an intrinsic value potentially double the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:15">[00:17:15]</a>. The company is also expected to have significant future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:27">[00:17:27]</a>. However, the financial-economic factor is less relevant in the short and medium term for Alibaba; monitoring the evolution of the situation and the company's cooperation with government guidelines is crucial <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:36">[00:17:36]</a>.

## Protecting Investments from New Risks
In situations of [[economic_risks_and_investment_strategies | economic risks and investment strategies]], common sense investing is key <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:11">[00:18:11]</a>. Investing against the market or waiting 100% for opportunities is not advisable, as inflation can erode capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:14">[00:18:14]</a>.

Here are three pieces of advice for 2021:
1.  **Maintain Liquidity:** Keep 10-30% liquidity in the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:24">[00:18:24]</a>. Statistically, the market corrects at least 10% annually, providing opportunities to capitalize on with cash <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:30">[00:18:30]</a>.
2.  **Invest with Conviction:** Only invest in companies for which you have strong conviction and have conducted in-depth analysis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>. Even in a euphoric or expensive market, good investment opportunities can always be found <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:47">[00:18:47]</a>.
3.  **Monitor Major Investors:** Observe how major investors, such as Stanley Druckenmiller and Michael Burry, are positioning their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:55">[00:18:55]</a>. Druckenmiller's main investments include high-growth, high-profit-margin companies like Alibaba, Amazon, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:03">[00:19:03]</a>. Michael Burry's main investments include Google, Pfizer, and ACWT <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:14">[00:19:14]</a>.

Bill Gates, identified as one of the world's richest and most powerful individuals, has played a significant role concerning recent global health crises, both through his past predictions and his current [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | investment strategies]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:03">[00:00:03]</a>. His movements and statements are closely followed by millions of investors internationally due to his typically accurate vision of the future economy and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:24">[00:01:24]</a>.

## Predictions of a Crisis

Before the recent crisis, [[bill_gates_predictions_on_economic_threats | Bill Gates]] warned that a pandemic very similar to the one experienced was highly likely to occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:51">[00:00:51]</a>. He also cautioned that the world was not prepared for such an event <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Furthermore, his extensive knowledge of the biotechnology sector enabled him to predict which company would be the first to develop a successful vaccine against the problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

More recently, [[bill_gates_predictions_about_a_future_economic_crisis | Bill Gates]] has stated that it is "practically certain" humanity will experience a new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. He explained to CNN that variants are returning to richer countries because the problem is not being tackled quickly enough, which will necessitate the development of "second-generation vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:41">[00:03:41]</a>.

## Preparation Through Investment Strategy

In what represents a radical change in his [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | investment strategy]], [[bill_gates_portfolio_changes_and_strategies | Bill Gates]] appears to be preparing for a crisis akin to the one experienced in 2020 by acquiring stocks of vaccine-producing companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:05">[00:00:05]</a>. His [[bill_gates_investment_portfolio | investment portfolio]] has recently been made public, revealing that he has concentrated 70% of his investments in just three companies that produce vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">[00:01:34]</a>. This shift has led many investors to question whether this new strategy reflects a negative outlook on the ongoing crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

### Key Vaccine Stock Investments

Bill Gates primarily uses two investment vehicles, but his new [[bill_gates_investment_strategies_and_decisions | investment strategy]] is evident within the portfolio of the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:36:00">[02:36:00]</a>. This portfolio now heavily favors companies developing what are known as "second-generation vaccines," which are expected to be more sophisticated and effective <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:00">[03:07:00]</a>.

His significant holdings, accounting for over 70% of his foundation's portfolio, include <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:53:00">[02:53:00]</a>:

*   **BioNTech (BNTX)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>: Gates began investing in this German company in late 2019, just six months before the crisis started <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:22:00">[05:22:00]</a>. BioNTech, in collaboration with Pfizer, was the first company to launch an effective vaccine <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:33:00">[05:33:00]</a>. The company anticipates a recurrent demand for its products, with predictions of one million doses per year from 2022 onwards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:43:00">[05:43:00]</a>.
*   **CureVac (CVAC)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>: Another German company, Gates invested in CureVac in 2015 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:29:00">[06:29:00]</a>. CureVac is collaborating with companies like GlaxoSmithKline on "second-generation vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:53:00">[06:53:00]</a>. It is currently in a development phase, making it a more speculative and volatile investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:03:00">[07:03:00]</a>.
*   **Vir Biotechnology (VIR)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:57:00">[02:57:00]</a>: Gates invested in this highly innovative company in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:47:00">[07:47:00]</a>. Vir Biotechnology is developing solutions against multiple variants, including the Delta variant, with high effectiveness levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:54:00">[07:54:00]</a>. An additional reason for Gates' interest is the development of an inhaled vaccine solution, which could simplify application and increase public participation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:07:00">[08:07:00]</a>. Similar to CureVac, Vir is in the development phase and is a speculative, high-risk investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:21:00">[08:21:00]</a>.

Investing in biotechnology companies during their development phase can be very risky and volatile, requiring a high level of knowledge for success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. However, successful outcomes can yield very high financial rewards <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>.

## The Future of Vaccines

In an interview with CNBC, [[bill_gates_on_the_end_of_the_current_crisis | Bill Gates]] explained his significant interest in the vaccine sector by stating that a return to normalcy depends not on the first generation of vaccines, but on the "next generation of vaccines" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:58:00">[08:58:00]</a>. He noted that numerous companies are working to achieve this second generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:05:00">[09:05:00]</a>. These statements, combined with his recent [[bill_gates_vaccine_investment_strategy | investment strategy]], indicate which companies are best positioned to develop these future vaccines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. As seen with companies like Moderna or BioNTech, developing effective solutions that aid humanity can also generate high returns for shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:20:00">[09:20:00]</a>.

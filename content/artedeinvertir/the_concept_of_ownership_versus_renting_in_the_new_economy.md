A significant economic and social reform, known as the 2030 Agenda, is underway, promising to affect savings and [[investment_opportunities_in_a_new_economic_scenario | investments]] globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. This agenda, which has been in implementation since 2015, is supported by powerful figures like Bill Gates, Bill Clinton, most heads of state, and the United Nations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>. Its core motto is "you will have nothing and you will be happy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:44">[00:00:44]</a>.

## Origins and Key Figures

The 2030 Agenda, also referred to as "global objectives" or "global agenda for the world," originated from the Davos Forum, a gathering of the world's most influential individuals, including Bill Gates and [[ray_dalios_perspective_on_the_new_world_economic_order | Ray Dalio]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:15">[00:01:15]</a>. This forum debates economic policies that are later implemented at a local level <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>.

Klaus Schwab, who leads the Davos Forum (also known as the World Economic Forum), is a central figure in this movement, seeking to modify the new economic and social reality for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:42">[00:02:42]</a>. Ida Auken, a Danish politician, is also behind some of the main economic reforms promoted by the 2030 Agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:53">[00:02:53]</a>. She famously summarized the economic part of this new global agenda by stating, "Welcome to 2030, I have nothing, I have no privacy and my life has never been better" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a>.

## The Shift from Ownership to Renting

One of the most striking predictions made by the World Economic Forum in its promotional video "Eight predictions for the world in the year 2030" is: "You will own nothing and you will be happy, you will be able to rent anything you need" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:46">[00:04:46]</a>. This indicates a profound economic change that is already being experienced, shifting the mentality from owning things to renting or leasing them long-term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:58">[00:04:58]</a>.

This shift has been "tremendously beneficial for a small number of companies" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>. The new economic model encourages greater consumption, leading to increased business profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:27">[00:05:27]</a>.

### Examples of the Rental Model in Practice

*   **Cars**: Increasingly, people rent their cars through leasing or financing from companies and banks, paying a monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:33">[00:05:33]</a>. In the US, 70% of vehicles sold are financed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:43">[00:05:43]</a>.
*   **Electronics**: Most people do not own their iPhone but rent it from Apple for a monthly fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:47">[00:05:47]</a>.
*   **Housing**: The majority of people do not own their homes, instead having a mortgage with a monthly fee or paying monthly rent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Entertainment**: Movies are typically accessed through monthly subscriptions to services like Netflix, rather than being purchased <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>.
*   **Automotive Features**: Companies like BMW have announced subscription models for car features, such as heated seats ($15/month), artificial sports sounds ($99/month), or adaptive headlights ($10/month) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:06">[00:06:06]</a>. These initiatives, if encouraged by political and economic powers, could become standard, forcing consumers to spend more <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:31">[00:06:31]</a>.

### Corporate Beneficiaries of the Subscription Model

Companies that have adapted to this "rental" or "subscription" model have seen significant growth:

*   **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Since 2013, Microsoft shifted from selling perpetual licenses for products like Microsoft Office to charging a monthly rental fee <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">[00:08:00]</a>. While an annual fee of $100 might seem cheaper initially compared to a $300 license, it is paid for a lifetime, leading to exponential benefits for the company over time, potentially extracting thousands of dollars from a client <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. This change in model caused Microsoft's stock price to multiply by over ten times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:47">[00:07:47]</a>. Paradoxically, while Microsoft was fined for monopolistic practices 20 years ago, similar behavior today is approved because it aligns with the 2030 Agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>.
*   **Adobe (ADBE)**: Similar to Microsoft, Adobe transitioned its economic model around 2012, moving from selling licenses for products like Photoshop and Premiere (around $1000) to charging a smaller monthly license fee of $50 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:36">[00:12:36]</a>. This has proven much more lucrative for Adobe, providing constant cash flow for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The company's stock has multiplied by more than 12 times, and its earnings per share have risen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:40">[00:12:40]</a>.
*   **Automotive Sector**: Financial divisions of companies like Volkswagen and Renault are often more profitable than their car manufacturing businesses due to financing and leasing models <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:35">[00:13:35]</a>.

Many companies, particularly in the technology sector, benefit from this change in mentality because it allows for competitive, nearly monopolistic positions, leading to flourishing profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:51">[00:13:51]</a>. These practices are not investigated for consumer abuse because they are approved by those in power, aligning with the objectives of the 2030 Agenda <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>.

Many of these companies have seen their valuations drop drastically in the first half of 2022 due to market fear, potentially creating [[investment_opportunities_in_a_new_economic_scenario | investment opportunities]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:21">[00:14:21]</a>.

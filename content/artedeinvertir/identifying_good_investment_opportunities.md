Warren Buffett, considered the greatest investor of all time, has achieved tremendous success, turning an early $1,000 investment into over $34 million today <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">00:00:01</a>. He revealed seven basic principles during a university lecture that he uses to achieve this success in the world of [[investment_opportunities_and_strategies | investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>. This article explains these core pieces of advice, particularly useful for beginners or those with limited capital, illustrating them with examples of real and current stocks that fit these principles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">00:00:25</a>.

## Principle 1: Invest in Good Companies and Avoid Mediocre Businesses

Warren Buffett emphasizes that it is generally a bad idea to invest in low-quality businesses, even if their stocks appear cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:54">00:00:54</a>. While a quick 30-40% gain might be possible, such companies do not generate long-term value, preventing investors from benefiting from the compound capitalization effect <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">00:01:02</a>.

Investing in exceptional businesses, even at a slightly higher valuation, offers two main advantages:
1.  **One-time analysis**: You analyze the company once and can theoretically benefit from returns for many years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:25">00:01:25</a>.
2.  **Compound capitalization**: These shares can multiply significantly (8, 10, 20, or 50 times) in the [[stock_market_analysis_and_investment_opportunities | stock market]] over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">00:01:35</a>.

For instance, General Motors' stock has shown little movement over the past 10 years, despite occasional 30-40% rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">00:01:44</a>. This contrasts sharply with Moody's (MC), a favorite of Warren Buffett, which has multiplied more than 10 times in the last decade, demonstrating its long-term value generation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:24">00:02:24</a>.

### Identifying Good Businesses

To [[identifying_good_businesses_and_competitive_advantages | identify good businesses]]:
1.  **Study Fundamentals**: Understand the company's operations, profit and loss account, and balance sheet. Look for consistent growth in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:06">00:03:06</a>.
2.  **Stock Market Performance**: For beginners, observe a stock's historical performance. If a company hasn't multiplied several times over 10-20 years, it's likely not a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:23">00:03:23</a>.

Later, valuation must be considered, as even good companies should not be bought at any price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:37">00:03:37</a>.

## Principle 2: Understand Companies Before Investing in Them

Understanding a business goes beyond knowing its products or services; it means having confidence that the company will generate profits, and those profits will increase, over the next ten years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:52">00:03:52</a>. Warren Buffett's secret to long-term success is avoiding investments in very new or rapidly changing sectors because he cannot reliably analyze their future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:08">00:04:08</a>.

*   **Example: McDonald's (MCD)**: Warren Buffett favors McDonald's because technological changes won't stop people from eating hamburgers. The company's revenue generation is easy to understand, risks are few, and future increasing profits are predictable <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:23">00:04:23</a>. This understanding has led to the stock multiplying by more than three times in the last decade <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:56">00:04:56</a>.
*   **Contrast: Intel (INTC)**: In contrast, Warren Buffett historically avoided Intel. The chip sector is rapidly changing, and competitors like NVIDIA have altered the landscape, complicating Intel's future profit outlook and leading to poor stock performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:07">00:05:07</a>.

## Principle 3: When You See an Opportunity, Make the Most of It

When a good [[analysis_of_specific_investment_opportunities | investment opportunity]] in an understandable business arises, don't be afraid to take a significant position in your portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:45">00:05:45</a>. This aggressive approach to conviction has been key to Buffett's success <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">00:06:00</a>.

*   **Example: Apple (AAPL)**: Apple represents an impressive 47% of Warren Buffett's portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:08">00:06:08</a>. When he saw the opportunity in 2016, he invested over $15 billion, leading to shares multiplying more than six times and generating nearly $100 trillion in profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">00:06:24</a>.
*   **Historical Pattern**: Historically, Buffett's five main positions have always comprised over 50% of his total portfolio, demonstrating high conviction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">00:06:42</a>. Examples include Coca-Cola (multiplied >20 times) and American Express (multiplied >200 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">00:06:55</a>.

Buffett advises not to feel bad for missing opportunities you couldn't analyze (like Bitcoin), but to regret missing those you *could* understand (like Netflix) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">00:07:22</a>. The key is patience, waiting for understandable ideas, then acting decisively <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:27">00:07:27</a>.

## Principle 4: Do Not Sell Unless the Business Has Changed at a Fundamental Level

Extraordinary stocks often experience significant drops (30-50%) in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">00:08:01</a>. During these moments of panic, Warren Buffett advises focusing on whether the company continues to generate profits and if its competitive position remains unchanged <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:12">00:08:12</a>. If not, the most logical action is to do nothing or even increase your position <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">00:08:24</a>.

*   **Example: Tesla (TSLA)**: Tesla shares, despite multiplying over 90 times in 10 years, experienced 8 stock market corrections with falls exceeding 30% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">00:08:32</a>. A novice investor selling in panic would have missed out on long-term returns because the underlying business had not fundamentally changed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">00:08:54</a>.

Conversely, shares *should* be sold without hesitation when new risks emerge or the business fundamentally changes, even if the stock price hasn't fallen <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:09">00:09:09</a>. Warren Buffett recently did this by selling all his IBM shares, despite their lateral behavior on the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:21">00:09:21</a>.

*   **Example of a Stock Fitting This Principle: Stryker (SYK)**: Stryker, a leading medical equipment manufacturer, operates in a stable sector with tailwinds from an aging population <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">00:09:31</a>. Its profits are estimated to be increasing and stable for the future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">00:09:49</a>. During one past rise, Stryker experienced ten occasions where shares fell more than 20%, yet it continued its upward trajectory, demonstrating the importance of not selling during temporary dips if the business remains strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">00:09:55</a>.

## Principle 5: Invest Using Facts, Not Emotions

One of the most crucial pieces of advice is to avoid letting emotions dominate [[investment_education_and_strategies | investment decisions]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">00:11:00</a>. Many investors fail because they are swayed by excitement in bull markets, buying stocks that have already risen, or ignoring stocks that haven't, missing "giant opportunities" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">00:11:07</a>.

> "Investors get very excited during bull markets. They look in the rearview mirror and say I made a lot of money last year and I want to make more money this year and that's why they keep buying and buying those stocks that keep going up in the stock market however if a stock has not gone up during a bull market people think that it is not a good business and they do not bother to analyze those stocks and this creates giant opportunities." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">00:11:17</a>

*   **Example: Disney (DIS)**: For five years, Disney's stock performed sideways while the rest of the market climbed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">00:12:01</a>. However, in recent months, it more than doubled, despite being the same business with the same assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:12">00:12:12</a>. This created the very "tremendous opportunities" Warren Buffett refers to <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:18">00:12:18</a>.

## Principle 6: Only Invest in Companies with Talented and Integral Managers

Behind every share is a business run by people, and their talent and integrity play a fundamental role in the business's future and stock evolution <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:42">00:12:42</a>.

*   **Example: Amazon (AMZN)**: Warren Buffett's recent investment in Amazon highlights this principle. Jeff Bezos, Amazon's founder, is renowned for his business talent and has consistently treated shareholders with integrity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">00:13:01</a>.

Buffett also recommends investing in companies where management holds a significant number of shares, aligning their interests with those of other shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:29">00:13:29</a>. Websites like Morningstar.com or MarketScreener.com allow you to check management shareholdings and salaries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:52">00:13:52</a>. Ideally, the value of shares owned by management should be ten times higher than their salary, ensuring aligned interests and a positive long-term outlook for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:57">00:13:57</a>.

## Principle 7: Always Buy Shares Below Their Intrinsic Value

Perhaps the most important principle is to always buy shares below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:25">00:14:25</a>. Intrinsic value is a subjective calculation made by the investor through a [[evaluating_investment_opportunities_in_a_bearish_market | stock valuation]] process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">00:14:33</a>. It involves making a conservative estimate of future benefits and applying various valuation methods to arrive at that value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">00:14:41</a>.

*   **Example: Coca-Cola**: A graph illustrating Coca-Cola's performance shows that when the market price (red line) was above the calculated intrinsic value (blue line), as in 2003-2004, it was not a good time to invest, and shares subsequently declined <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:14">00:15:14</a>. Conversely, when the price was below intrinsic value, as in 2009 or 2012, subsequent [[investment_opportunities_in_quality_stocks | stock market performance]] was good <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:39">00:15:39</a>.

Valuing shares, while simple, requires learning <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:45">00:15:45</a>. These principles form the bedrock of Warren Buffett's enduring [[characteristics_of_successful_investment_approaches | investment success]].

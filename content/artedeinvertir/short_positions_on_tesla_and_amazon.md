David Einhorn, known as Vicens Hong in this context, is a highly respected investor on Wall Street, noted for his average annual returns exceeding 15% and his accurate prediction of the Lehman Brothers collapse [00:00:02]. In a recent letter to his investors, Einhorn outlined his bearish outlook on the stock market and revealed that he has focused some of his short bets on popular stocks like Tesla and Amazon [00:00:30].

## Vicens Hong's Investment Strategy
Einhorn is described as an "investor," meaning he employs a long-term strategy by investing in stocks he believes are undervalued or have strong prospects, while simultaneously [[short_selling_and_its_risks | investing against]] stocks he deems overvalued or with poor prospects [00:02:00]. This dual strategy aims to produce satisfactory results in various market environments, including [[bear_market_strategies_and_longterm_investment_opportunities | bear markets]], where short positions can support the overall portfolio [00:02:14].

Einhorn, typically known for moderate market statements, has been unusually specific about his current market predictions [00:02:30]. He believes the current "huge technological bubble" in the stock market reached its peak on September 2, 2020, and has already begun to deflate [00:04:23]. This sentiment shift from greed to complacency has led him to adjust his portfolio by adding short positions in many "low quality stocks that are trading at very high valuations" [00:04:37]. The Nasdaq index, which Einhorn considers highly overvalued, reached its highs around 12,500 on September 2, 2020, and has not touched that level since [00:05:03].

His reasons for identifying a bubble include:
*   **High Number of IPOs** There is a correlation between a high number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) and changes in market cycles, with many new technology companies seeing over 200% revaluations on their first day [00:05:37].
*   **Unprofitable Companies** An impressive 80% of companies currently listed on the stock market are not making profits, surpassing the record set during the 2000 tech bubble [00:05:58].
*   **High Speculation** The market exhibits a high degree of speculation, exemplified by Hertz, a bankrupt car rental company, whose shares inexplicably surged from $1 to $5 after announcing bankruptcy [00:06:15]. This led to the American regulator, the SEC, intervening to prevent the company from selling worthless shares to investors [00:06:49].
*   **Stock Splits** Popular stocks like Tesla and Apple experienced significant revaluations (over 50% for Tesla and 30% for Apple) immediately after announcing stock splits, an unusual occurrence in a rational market as splits do not add intrinsic value to a company [00:07:34].

## Short Position on Amazon
Vicens Hong has invested against Amazon (ticker: AMZN, currently $3,200 per share) [00:08:36]. While acknowledging Amazon as a "great company," Einhorn believes its "current valuation on the stock market is excessive" due to its recent significant rise [00:08:45].

Amazon's sales have grown by 37%, and its operating cash flow by over 56%, demonstrating "operating leverage" where profits grow faster than sales [00:09:01]. However, evaluating it using the EV/EBITDA ratio, the historical average valuation of Amazon over the last five years is around 26 times EBITDA [00:09:22].

> [00:09:36] "In this year 2020 it is estimated that Amazon can earn more than 54 billion dollars in its lifetime however this figure in the next three years that grows above 100 billion dollars if we value it at its historical average it would reach a value of five thousand two hundred dollars an interesting realization price compared to the three thousand two hundred it is listed at however lower than the one thousand 700 it was listed at when we did that first analysis a year ago this valuation could differ from the opinion that Vicens has about Amazon shares"

## Short Position on Tesla
Tesla (ticker: TSLA, currently $420 per share) is another stock against which Vicens Hong has invested, aiming to profit from a potential drop in its market price [00:12:44]. The relationship between Einhorn and Elon Musk has been contentious, with Musk publicly ridiculing Einhorn as Tesla's stock continued to rise, causing losses for Einhorn's fund, Greenlight Capital [00:12:57].

Conversely, Einhorn has publicly accused Tesla of:
*   "Manipulating its accounts" to "artificially inflate its profits" [00:13:16].
*   Artificially increasing income through "sales of cars that do not exist" [00:13:50].
*   Exploiting "certain tax credits" to boost currently reported profits [00:13:57].

Regarding [[analysis_of_bearish_investments_in_tesla | Tesla's valuation]], it is projected to earn $3 per share in 2021, trading at "over 140 times earnings" [00:14:12]. Investing in such highly valued situations requires a very deep understanding of the company's ability to drastically increase earnings in the future [00:14:26].

Despite Einhorn's strong convictions, [[short_selling_and_its_risks | investing against a stock]], regardless of how overvalued it may seem, "can be very dangerous," as Einhorn himself has experienced significant losses over the past five years from his short position in Tesla [00:14:40].

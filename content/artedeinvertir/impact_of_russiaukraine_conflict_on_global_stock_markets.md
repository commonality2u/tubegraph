The conflict between Russia and Ukraine has had significant and immediate effects on global stock markets and the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">00:00:04</a>. The Russian stock market, in particular, experienced a collapse greater than that seen during the 2008 financial crisis or even the 2020 confinement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">00:00:10</a>, with its index falling 40% from its highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:06">00:01:06</a>. Other global stock markets have also seen downturns due to the escalating tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:17">00:01:17</a>.

## Immediate Economic Consequences

### Energy Market Volatility
The conflict has exacerbated existing issues in the energy sector. Germany, for instance, suspended the certification of the Nord Stream gas pipeline, which was intended to bring Russian gas to Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:34">00:01:34</a>. This action caused gas prices in Europe to skyrocket, worsening an already high-price environment due to supply crises and inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:46">00:01:46</a>. Higher energy costs, including oil approaching $100 a barrel (compared to $50 a year prior), reduce consumers' disposable income, which is critical given that consumption accounts for 70% of the economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">00:01:59</a>.

Russia is a major global oil producer, accounting for 10% of the world's daily consumption <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">00:04:13</a>. Even small disruptions in supply, such as a 2-4 million barrel gap, can lead to disproportionate price increases, as seen in 2008 when oil jumped from $100 to $150 in weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">00:04:40</a>. If sanctions prevent Russia from trading its oil, it could create a global bottleneck, severely impacting energy costs worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">00:05:02</a>. While oil-producing companies might benefit, the rest of the world would be harmed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">00:05:14</a>.

### Financial Sanctions: SWIFT System
Western countries have threatened to exclude Russia from the SWIFT system, which facilitates international payments in euros, pounds, and dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:33">00:02:33</a>. While Russia would be the primary victim, such measures would significantly [[implications_of_swift_sanctions_on_russia | limit global trade]] and negatively affect Western companies reliant on the Russian market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">00:02:45</a>.

### Impact on Agriculture and Food Prices
The conflict also affects the agriculture and food industries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:53">00:06:53</a>. Russia is a significant producer of grains and wheat, ranking fourth globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">00:07:08</a>. When combined with Ukraine's production, the region accounts for nearly 20% of worldwide grain output <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">00:07:28</a>. Reduced production due to the conflict or sanctions on Russia could lead to disproportionate price increases, potentially 50-100%, even for small supply reductions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:51">00:07:51</a>. Food commodity prices, already rising due to inflation, have seen a recent surge due to the conflict <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:00">00:08:00</a>.

### Fertilizer Market Disruption
Russia and Ukraine are major producers of fertilizers, particularly potassium, a key chemical component <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:33">00:08:33</a>. Russia, including Belarusian production, holds almost 20% of the global market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:49">00:08:49</a>. Disruptions here would further increase food prices and overall inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:03">00:09:03</a>.

## Historical Market Behavior During Conflicts

Historically, stock markets tend to fall *before* conflicts due to investor anxiety and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:57">00:11:57</a>. However, once negative events occur, markets often realize it's "not the end of the world" and trade continues <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">00:10:20</a>.

A common saying in the stock market is "buy with the drums of war and sell with the sound or melody of the violin" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:39">00:09:39</a>. This suggests that markets often behave bullishly in the months following the onset of conflicts like Vietnam, the Gulf War, Iraq, or Crimea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">00:09:48</a>. Even significant drops, such as the 20% fall during the invasion of Iraq in 1990 or the Pearl Harbor attack, recovered within 6 to 12 months <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">00:11:15</a>. This pattern indicates that while conflicts are terrible on a human and social level, their [[economic impact of the Ukraine occupation | economic impact]] on global markets is often temporary <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">00:10:34</a>.

When buying during conflicts, assets are cheaper, leading to potentially greater returns. For example, small-cap stocks, which typically yield 1-11% annually, have shown higher returns when bought during conflicts <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:56">00:12:56</a>. Conversely, "safer" investments like bonds tend to offer less return during conflicts because capital flows into them, making them more expensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:31">00:14:31</a>.

## Company-Specific Impacts and Investment Considerations

### Defense Sector
Defense stocks, such as Lockheed Martin (famous for F-22 and F-35), Raytheon (missile systems), and Dassault Aviation (aircraft for the French/European army), have seen increases during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:54">00:15:54</a>. However, investors should maintain a long-term view rather than speculating on short-term surges <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:14">00:16:14</a>.

### Russian Companies
*   **Gazprom:** As a major Russian gas and oil producer, Gazprom has experienced significant declines despite surging gas and oil prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:44">00:17:44</a>. This is partly due to the risk associated with Russia's political system, which can lead to expropriations, causing the Russian stock market to trade at an average of five times earnings, compared to 15-16 times in Western markets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:13">00:19:13</a>. For cyclical stocks like Gazprom, the best time to buy is often when the P/E valuation is highest, as this indicates raw material prices are lowest and future results are expected to improve <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:59">00:20:59</a>.
*   **Qiwi:** Described as "Russia's PayPal," Qiwi saw a pre-market fall of over 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:40">00:26:40</a>. Despite previous drops and a current trading price of around four times expected profits, the company has solid fundamentals and remunerates shareholders through dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:34">00:27:34</a>.
*   **Sberbank:** One of Russia's leading banks, Sberbank, has also seen a decline due to the situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:51">00:28:51</a>.

### Fertilizer Companies
*   **Mosaic:** This company, involved in potassium-based fertilizers, could benefit if sanctions prevent Russia from trading its fertilizers, as international companies would pick up the demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:19">00:22:19</a>. Mosaic's stock has doubled in the last year due to inflation and rising food/grain prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:06">00:23:06</a>. However, cyclical stocks like Mosaic have a history of not generating long-term value, often seeing collapses after booms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:31">00:23:31</a>. Investors should be cautious with such "rental" stocks that are good for speculation rather than long-term holding <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:02">00:25:02</a>.

### Technology and Other Sectors
*   **Adobe:** Despite solid results, Adobe's stock fell significantly (almost 40%) due to general market negativity toward technology stocks, reflecting the market's shift from euphoria to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:21">00:31:21</a>. Technology funds are currently underweight, creating a "good breeding ground for the future" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:16">00:32:16</a>.
*   **Inpost:** This logistics company, seen as an interesting investment, is trading at lower valuations than its growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">00:37:06</a>.
*   **Future Plc:** This company acquires traditional media brands and transitions them to online models, leveraging loyal audiences with high purchasing power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:22">00:45:22</a>.
*   **Data Group:** A technology company trading at 9-10 times EBITDA, lower than comparable companies with potentially higher growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:33">00:50:33</a>.
*   **Green Landscaping:** This company has shown good performance and recently announced a share buyback, indicating that management sees its shares as undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:44">00:52:44</a>.
*   **Globant:** A digital engineering company, it has seen corrections but maintains strong growth rates (around 40%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">00:53:52</a>. The market values this sector highly due to its significant growth potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:40">00:54:40</a>.

## Investment Philosophy in Volatile Times

*   **Training and Opportunity:** Periods of market crisis and high [[Stock market volatility and the impact of global events | volatility]], such as those triggered by conflicts, present opportunities for trained investors to make good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:08">00:29:08</a>.
*   **Risk Assets:** Cryptocurrencies are considered risky assets and tend to fall during "risk-off" periods in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:44">00:30:44</a>. Gold, however, can act as a refuge against inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:05">00:31:05</a>.
*   **Downward Averaging:** Buying more shares as their price drops can be a strategy to take advantage of downturns, but requires caution to avoid companies going bankrupt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:52">00:34:52</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective:** Investors should be prepared for portfolios to fall 40-50% and react temperately, making good decisions without panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:47">00:40:47</a>. Short-term drops of 5-20% are normal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:29">00:41:29</a>.
*   **Understanding Valuation:** Highly overvalued companies are most vulnerable during market downturns, as a lack of confidence leads to collapses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:43">00:36:43</a>.
*   **Macro vs. Micro Fears:** It is often a good opportunity to buy good stocks when there are macro fears (like a conflict) but the company's fundamentals remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:22">00:38:22</a>.
*   **Compounding Growth:** For growth stocks, even if valuations become demanding, it is often better to hold on and benefit from long-term compounding rather than selling and missing out on future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:49">00:56:49</a>.

The overall message is that while conflicts create uncertainty and volatility, they are typically not catastrophic for the global economy in the long term, and often present buying opportunities for informed investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:23">00:57:23</a>.

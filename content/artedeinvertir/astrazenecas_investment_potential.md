## Company Profile
AstraZeneca is at the forefront of finding a solution to the current global health challenge, with expectations to have it ready by the fall of 2020 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. The solution, developed in collaboration with the University of Oxford, is already in Phase 3, where drug success rates are at least 80% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:47">[00:08:47]</a>.

The company is also a world leader in medicines for:
*   Oncology <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:58">[00:08:58]</a>
*   Cardiovascular problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>
*   Respiratory problems <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:01">[00:09:01]</a>

## Recent Performance and Growth
Thanks to significant discoveries in recent years, AstraZeneca has transitioned from a declining company to one that grows at annual rates above 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

In the first quarter, AstraZeneca reported:
*   Over 15% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>
*   Profits exceeding $1 per share, leading to an annualized figure of $4 in earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:30">[00:09:30]</a>

## Valuation and Price Targets
For biotechnology shares with growth like AstraZeneca, a price-to-earnings (P/E) ratio of at least 25 is considered appropriate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:37">[00:09:37]</a>.

Based on an estimated $4 earnings per share for the current year, a target price of $100 per share can be derived by multiplying earnings by the P/E ratio (4 x 25 = 100) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>.

Furthermore, looking 3 to 5 years into the future, the company is projected to earn almost $7 in earnings per share, which could lead to a potential realization of over $150 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:11">[00:10:11]</a>.

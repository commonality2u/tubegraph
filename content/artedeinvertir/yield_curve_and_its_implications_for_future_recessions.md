The [[Federal Reserve]] has published a document outlining changes in the economic situation and when a possible [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] could begin <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:01">[00:00:01]</a>. This document is supported by additional data, highlighting shifts in recent weeks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:11">[00:00:11]</a>. Understanding these changes is crucial for [[investment_opportunities in inflationary environments | investment opportunities]] and navigating a weak economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:20">[00:00:20]</a>.

## Federal Reserve Forecasts

According to CNBC news, the [[Federal Reserve]] has begun forecasting a decrease in GDP, which indicates a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:19">[00:01:19]</a>. While the market currently assigns only a 5% probability of this happening in 2025, the [[Federal Reserve]]'s own report, using market data and surveys of main economic actors, shows a projected negative GDP growth from -0.1% to -0.5% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:40">[00:01:40]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:47">[00:01:47]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:59">[00:01:59]</a>. This contrasts sharply with the consensus forecast of 1.5% to 3.9% growth, suggesting a potential surprise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:08">[00:02:08]</a>.

Interestingly, in 2022, there was a 90% expectation of a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]], but it did not occur <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This is because when everyone prepares for the worst, economic prudence is exercised, and excesses that could lead to bubbles or recessions are avoided <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:25">[00:02:25]</a>.

### Public vs. Private Sector Growth
The Minister of Economy of the United States under Donald Trump, Scott Bessen, noted that the private sector is in [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]], even though the overall economy appears to be growing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:47">[00:02:47]</a>. This situation is also observed in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>. The growth is primarily driven by the public sector through public spending and investments financed by governments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:54">[00:02:54]</a>. The private sector, however, is in a negative state <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. Sustainable economic growth requires the private sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:17">[00:03:17]</a>; otherwise, growth is financed by debt and public deficit <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:27">[00:03:27]</a>.

Public spending is currently at record deficit levels, nearly 2 trillion dollars, while the U.S. objective is only one trillion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>. This current level (almost 7-8% of GDP) is not sustainable, as explained by Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:16">[00:04:16]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. The goal is to reduce this deficit, which, while potentially causing short-term volatility, is a sound long-term decision for economic growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:50">[00:04:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:12">[00:05:12]</a>.

### GDPNow Forecast
The Federal Reserve of Atlanta, through its GDPNow data, forecasts a 1.5% drop in U.S. GDP for the quarter ending in March <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:38">[00:06:38]</a>. This is a significant decline from recent weeks' predictions of 2.5% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:41">[00:06:41]</a>.

### Inflation Slowdown
[[Inflation and its implications on the economy | Inflation]] is finally decreasing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:20">[00:07:20]</a>. This cooling of the economy was precisely what the [[Federal Reserve]] aimed for by keeping interest rates high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:25">[00:07:25]</a>. Truflation, a private company providing real-time [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] data, reports levels of only 1.5%, which is well below the Fed's 2% target <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:46">[00:07:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:09">[00:08:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:13">[00:08:13]</a>.

## The Yield Curve as a Predictor
The yield curve, determined by the stock and bond markets, is a crucial [[macroeconomic_indicators_and_their_implications | indicator]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:21">[00:08:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:40">[00:08:40]</a>. It has historically predicted almost all crises in advance, including the COVID-19 crisis, and has been reliable for the last 50 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:52">[00:08:52]</a>. Every time the yield curve has inverted, a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] has usually occurred within 12 to 24 months afterward <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>.

### What is the Yield Curve?
The yield curve measures the profitability of 10-year U.S. government bonds against 3-month bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. It reflects long-term versus short-term interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. Normally, long-term interest rates are higher due to greater risk and uncertainty <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>.

### Inverted Yield Curve
An inverted yield curve occurs when people demand higher interest rates in the short term than in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>. This typically happens when central banks raise short-term interest rates significantly to cool the economy and combat [[inflation_and_its_implications_on_the_economy | inflation]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:14">[00:10:14]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:20">[00:10:20]</a>. For example, the [[Federal Reserve]] recently raised rates to almost 5%, while the market may see long-term bonds at 4%, creating a negative differential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>.

When the yield curve inverts:
*   It becomes more profitable to lend money in the short term than in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:50">[00:10:50]</a>.
*   The cost of mortgages and corporate financing rises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.
*   Companies cannot invest, and lenders prefer short-term, less risky loans <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.
*   The economic slowdown is usually felt 18 to 24 months later <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:17">[00:11:17]</a>.
*   Lack of credit for businesses and consumers leads to a slowdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:49">[00:11:49]</a>.
*   A psychological effect occurs, as people begin to question the economy's health, which can become a self-fulfilling prophecy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:13">[00:12:13]</a>.

The [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] does not happen when the yield curve is inverted, but rather a little after, typically when it "dis-invites" or crosses back from negative to positive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:02">[00:13:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:10">[00:13:10]</a>. This happens when the [[Federal Reserve]] realizes the need to reactivate the economy and rapidly lowers short-term interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:20">[00:13:20]</a>.

### Current Yield Curve Status
The yield curve has experienced one of its strongest inversions in a long time, decisively going to -1% until mid-2023 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:25">[00:15:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:30">[00:15:30]</a>. It has now begun to dis-invert <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:34">[00:15:34]</a>, and advanced GDP data appears to anticipate this situation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:40">[00:15:40]</a>. The yield curve has been inverted for a long time since 2022 and began to dis-invert strongly in January 2025 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:53">[00:15:53]</a>.

## Investing in a Weak Economy
[[Managing Risks in Economic Downturns | Managing risks]] and investing wisely in a weak economy is essential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>.

### General Advice:
*   **Avoid Debt for Investing**: Do not have debt when investing, especially when the market is at its highest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:32">[00:18:32]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:51">[00:18:51]</a>.
*   **Maintain Liquidity**: Having liquidity is crucial, as recommended by Warren Buffett. This allows taking advantage of opportunities during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:53">[00:18:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:52">[00:21:52]</a>.
*   **Rotate Portfolio**: Big investors rotate their portfolios to take advantage of opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:20">[00:19:20]</a>.
*   **Buy During Panic**: The best time to make money in the stock market is when there is fear and panic, and businesses are quoted at "ridiculous prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:36">[00:19:36]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
*   **Long-Term Perspective**: The stock market tends to rise and revalue over the long term because the economy advances, and businesses capitalize on that growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:12">[00:20:12]</a>.

### Investment Strategies:
1.  **Quality Companies with Recurring Income and Low Debt**: These businesses tend to drop less during crises, serving as a "store of liquidity" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:50">[00:20:50]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:58">[00:20:58]</a>. If the market falls significantly, these can be sold to create liquidity and invest in severely affected companies that have greater rebound potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:13">[00:21:13]</a>.
2.  **Long-Term Bonds**: Investing in long-term bonds, such as the TLT (20-year long-term bond ETF), can be a smart move <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:33">[00:22:33]</a>.
    *   If no [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] occurs and the market rises, these bonds likely maintain their value and continue paying returns (e.g., 4-5%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:13">[00:23:13]</a>.
    *   If a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]] occurs, the [[Federal Reserve]] will lower rates, causing the value of long-term bonds to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:41">[00:23:41]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:43">[00:23:43]</a>. This is because bonds move inversely to interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:54">[00:23:54]</a>.

All crises typically pass within 12 to 24 months, presenting opportunities to buy when fear and panic are high <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:29">[00:25:29]</a>.

### Sector Performance during Cycles
According to Fidelity, different sectors perform better or worse depending on economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:00">[00:28:00]</a>.
*   **During a [[economic_recession_indicators_and_predictions | recession]]**: Stable consumption (food, drinks, clothing, basic needs) and utilities (water, electricity) perform well because people must continue to consume these essentials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:09">[00:28:09]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:24">[00:28:24]</a>. The healthcare sector is also less affected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:40">[00:28:40]</a>.
*   **Sectors that suffer**: Real Estate and the financial sector are typically negatively impacted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:45">[00:28:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:55">[00:28:55]</a>.

Warren Buffett has recently been selling financial companies and increasing positions in the stable consumption sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:02">[00:29:02]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:11">[00:29:11]</a>.

## Examples of Crisis-Resistant Companies
Companies in the stable consumption sector often provide stability during downturns and continue to rise during recovery <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:12">[00:31:12]</a>.

### Ahold Delhaize (AHOLD)
Ahold Delhaize is a supermarket company with a strong presence in the U.S. (especially the East Coast) and Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:59">[00:32:59]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:05">[00:36:05]</a>. During the 2008-2012 financial crisis, while the broader market fell 60%, Ahold Delhaize remained mostly sideways with only a minor drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:06">[00:33:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:33:12">[00:33:12]</a>.

*   **Financial Stability**: It maintained or even increased profits during difficult periods (e.g., from 0.70 to 1 euro per share between 2007-2011) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:38:31">[00:38:31]</a>.
*   **Market Position**: It is a market leader (or #2) in most of its operating regions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:13">[00:36:13]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:17">[00:37:17]</a>.
*   **Scale Advantage**: Its massive scale (nearly 100 billion euros in revenue) provides significant negotiating power with suppliers, a critical advantage in a low-margin sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:45">[00:36:45]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:06">[00:37:06]</a>.
*   **Growth Strategy**: Plans to grow sales by 4% and EPS faster through share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:53">[00:40:53]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:01">[00:41:01]</a>.
*   **Valuation**: Trades at approximately 12 times earnings, significantly lower than comparable U.S. companies like Walmart (38 times earnings) despite stronger growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:15">[00:42:15]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:21">[00:42:21]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:43:26">[00:43:26]</a>. This highlights a trend of capital flow to the U.S. and a perceived "boring" status for European companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:45:57">[00:45:57]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:10">[00:46:10]</a>.

### British American Tobacco (BAT)
As a stable consumption company, BAT is also resilient to crises due to regular consumer demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:27">[00:47:27]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:32">[00:47:32]</a>.
*   **Crisis Performance**: During the 2008-2009 global financial crisis, BAT dropped only 13% (10% with dividends) while the market fell 60% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:51">[00:47:51]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:03">[00:48:03]</a>. The company maintained or increased profits during this period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>.
*   **New Categories**: While traditional tobacco volume has decreased, new categories like vaping and oral tobacco are experiencing significant annual growth (20% for oral tobacco until 2030) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:05">[00:51:05]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:25">[00:51:25]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:01">[00:53:01]</a>. These new products are considered less harmful and face lower taxes, improving profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:04">[00:59:04]</a>.
*   **Financial Outlook**: These new categories, previously generating losses, reached breakeven in 2023 and are expected to skyrocket profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:42">[00:55:42]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:05">[00:56:05]</a>. BAT aims to generate an accumulated free cash flow of $50 billion by 2030 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:40">[00:56:40]</a>.
*   **Valuation & Dividend**: Currently trades at historic lows, around 8 times earnings, compared to a historical average of 16-25 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:46">[00:59:46]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:16">[01:00:16]</a>. It offers a high dividend yield of 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:07">[00:57:07]</a>.
*   **Hidden Asset**: BAT owns a 20% stake in ITC Limited, a major consumer company in India. This stake, valued at $15 billion, effectively lowers BAT's trading multiple further when adjusted <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:26">[01:02:26]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>. India is a high-growth market for consumer products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:06">[01:01:06]</a>, <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:07">[01:03:07]</a>.

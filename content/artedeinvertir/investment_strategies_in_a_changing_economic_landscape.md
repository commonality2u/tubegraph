The global economy is entering a new world economic order, which is anticipated to be one of the most significant economic and social reforms in recent decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This shift is expected to have serious implications for both the stock market and the broader economy, potentially causing a major crisis in the U.S. and globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:00">[00:25:00]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Perspective on the New Economic Order
Ray Dalio, founder of Bridgewater Associates, the world's largest investor with over $100 billion under management, is often called the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" due to the high reliability of his economic and stock market predictions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:02:00">[01:02:00]</a>. He has warned extensively about the coming economic changes.

### The Great Cycle of Empires
Dalio explains that history reveals a "great cycle" in which dominant economies, such as the U.S. for the past 70 years, experience clear phases of economic rise and decline <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:20:00">[02:20:00]</a>. These phases are marked by specific economic events.

The U.S. is currently entering a phase of decline, characterized by:
*   High levels of systemic debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:44:00">[02:44:00]</a>.
*   Alarming quantities of money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:46:00">[02:46:00]</a>.
*   Resulting economic and social inequality <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.

In contrast, China is identified as being in an upward phase, marked by wealth creation and debt accumulation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:00">[02:54:00]</a>. Dalio also warns that political extremism in the U.S. will accelerate this shift towards a new world economic order <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:53:00">[01:53:00]</a>.

### Consequences of Money Printing and Inequality
Since the 2008 financial crisis, the U.S. Federal Reserve has printed record amounts of money, with its balance sheet growing from one trillion dollars to over seven trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:13:00">[03:13:00]</a>. This has led to:
*   Inflation levels not seen for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:35:00">[03:35:00]</a>.
*   Significant increases in raw material, product, good, and service prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:38:00">[03:38:00]</a>.
*   The "helicopter money theory" was implemented in 2020, where the government sent $1,200 checks to citizens <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:14:00">[04:14:00]</a>. Dalio argues that printing large amounts of money as a solution to economic problems historically leads to ruin, citing examples like Zimbabwe, Germany, Argentina, and Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:30:00">[04:30:00]</a>.

Economic inequality is reaching extreme levels, with just three individuals like Jeff Bezos accumulating more wealth than the poorest 50% of the American population (190 million people) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:14:00">[05:14:00]</a>. Historically, such social inequality leads to three significant economic problems affecting savings and [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainties | investments]]:
1.  **Rising Taxes:** Taxes are expected to increase in the U.S. and globally, negatively impacting the stock market by decreasing company profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.
2.  **Worsening Economic Conditions:** The Federal Reserve has warned of future interest rate hikes, which will negatively affect highly indebted companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:00:00">[06:00:00]</a>.
3.  **Increased Regulation and Wealth Redistribution:** New regulations and measures aimed at wealth redistribution will negatively affect almost all types of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:13:00">[06:13:00]</a>.

### The Biggest Risk: Government Bankruptcy
Ray Dalio identifies the biggest risk as the bankruptcy of governments after economic shocks, especially when combined with large economic inequalities and class differences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:44:00">[11:44:00]</a>. While not an immediate risk, if the economy continues its current trajectory, it could lead to severe consequences <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:56:00">[11:56:00]</a>.

## [[investment_strategies_in_changing_economic_conditions | Investment Strategies in Changing Economic Conditions]]
In this challenging economic environment, selling everything and holding liquidity is considered the worst idea, as inflation will erode the value of money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:28:00">[06:28:00]</a>. Instead, it is crucial to remain invested in the right assets.

Ray Dalio's portfolio strategy is designed to perform well in almost any economic environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:40:00">[06:40:00]</a>.

### Recommended [[investment_strategies_for_various_market_scenarios | Investment Strategies for Various Market Scenarios]]:
#### 1. Stocks (40% of Portfolio)
Dalio recommends allocating at least 40% of an investment portfolio to stocks, as they tend to perform well in the new economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:49:00">[06:49:00]</a>. A study by Bank of America over the last 50 years indicates that the best sectors in a scenario of rising inflation are:
*   **Energy Sector:** This is by far the top-performing sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:38:00">[07:38:00]</a>.
    *   **Example: Canadian Natural Resources (CNQ)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:45:00">[07:45:00]</a>
        *   One of the largest oil and energy producers in Canada.
        *   Listed on the U.S. stock exchange under ticker CNQ at ~$32 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:53:00">[07:53:00]</a>.
        *   Produces over 1 million barrels of oil daily from high-quality lands with low extraction costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:57:00">[07:57:00]</a>.
        *   Historically, shares have performed sideways due to low inflation and the sector being out of favor, leading to an attractive current valuation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:05:00">[08:05:00]</a>.
        *   Has increased dividends for the last 20 years, including during the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:19:00">[08:19:00]</a>.
        *   Trades at ~4x EBITDA, compared to the historical sector average of ~6x, suggesting potential upside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:26:00">[08:26:00]</a>.
        *   If Dalio's scenario materializes, profits and valuation multiples could increase significantly, potentially raising the intrinsic value to over $100 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:47:00">[08:47:00]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials Sector:** Follows energy as a strong performer <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:40:00">[07:40:00]</a>.

#### 2. Gold (10% of Portfolio)
Dalio states that gold will always perform well if this new world order materializes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:17:00">[09:17:00]</a>. He recommends holding at least 10% of a portfolio in gold or gold-related investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:22:00">[09:22:00]</a>.
*   Money printing decreases the value of bonds and transfers wealth towards financial assets, historically raising the price of gold and stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   Since March 2020, gold has risen from $1,500 to $1,800 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:44:00">[09:44:00]</a>.

**Ways to [[investment_strategies_during_economic_uncertainty | Invest During Economic Uncertainty]] in Gold:**
*   **Gold ETFs:** The easiest way is to buy a gold ETF that reflects the metal's performance.
    *   **GLD (U.S.):** The world's largest gold ETF, listed at ~$169 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:04:00">[10:04:00]</a>.
    *   **iShares GN (Europe):** A European version trading at ~â‚¬30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:24:00">[10:24:00]</a>.
*   **Gold Mining Companies:** This option is more complex due to operational risks (floods, landslides, strikes) but can offer higher potential returns than gold itself if gold prices rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.
    *   To reduce individual company risk, consider investing in a group of gold mining companies through an ETF.
    *   **GDX:** A large U.S. ETF representing gold mining companies, currently trading at ~$34 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="11:01:00">[11:01:00]</a>.

#### 3. Personal Defense Products (for extreme scenarios)
In an extreme scenario where government bankruptcy and social unrest become prominent, certain investments could perform well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:04:00">[12:04:00]</a>.
*   **Example: Axon Enterprise (AXON)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:09:00">[12:09:00]</a>
    *   Manufactures personal defense products (formerly TASER International).
    *   Listed in the U.S. under ticker AXON at ~$75 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:11:00">[12:11:00]</a>.
    *   Since 2008, shares have appreciated from $6 to over $75 due to high demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:19:00">[12:19:00]</a>.
    *   Trades at an attractive valuation of ~11x this year's earnings, compared to a historical average of ~16x, suggesting potential for over 40% appreciation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:29:00">[12:29:00]</a>.
    *   In Dalio's proposed extreme scenario, potential returns could be several times the current price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="12:42:00">[12:42:00]</a>.

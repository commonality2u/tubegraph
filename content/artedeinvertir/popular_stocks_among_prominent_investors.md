Examining the portfolios of prominent investors, often referred to as "strong hands" or "best investors," can be a valuable way to generate investment ideas. These investors have a proven track record, and the stocks they choose have often passed a rigorous analysis filter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. While their choices can inspire, individual investors must still conduct their own research and monitoring to understand the investment thoroughly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:57">[00:00:57]</a>.

## How to Identify Popular Stocks Among Top Investors

A useful resource for tracking the holdings of major managers is `dataroma.com` <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Investment managers overseeing more than $100 million are required to report their quarterly purchases and sales, typically published a month to a month and a half after the quarter ends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:36">[00:04:36]</a>. This information provides insights into what "strong hands" are currently buying <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

## Prominent Large-Cap Investments

### Financial Services & Banks
*   **Visa (V) / Mastercard (MA)**: Both Visa and Mastercard are considered very good companies with strong competitive advantages, offering potential annual returns of 10-15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>.
*   **Marsh & McLennan Companies (MMC)**: An insurance broker that is considered one of the best companies in its sector, often running a profitable business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:53">[00:05:53]</a>.
*   **Wells Fargo (WFC)**: The financial sector, including banks, is currently trading below its historical average valuation, making it relatively cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:13">[00:06:13]</a>. Wells Fargo was a top popular stock in the last quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>. While [[investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] has reduced his stake, the stock has performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>. Valuation for banks often uses metrics like net income, book value, and tangible book value. Wells Fargo has a 12% return on tangible book value, suggesting it should trade at two times its book value, but is currently trading at approximately 1.1 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Analysts project its earnings per share could reach $4-5 in two years, leading to a valuation range of $60-75 per share based on a P/E multiple of 15 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:07">[00:09:07]</a>.

### Healthcare
*   **TVS**: A healthcare sector company that has historically traded at 15-20 times earnings, but recently dropped to 8 times before recovering to around 10 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. Despite Amazon's entry into healthcare, these companies possess strong competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:09">[00:11:09]</a>. Debt from acquisitions is being repaid, which is expected to boost earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:30">[00:11:30]</a>.
*   **UnitedHealth (UNH)**: Considered one of the best health insurers in the US, known for high quality and predictability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:08">[00:21:08]</a>. It's expected to grow at 5-10% annually, supplemented by share buybacks and dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:16">[00:21:16]</a>.

### Technology & E-commerce
*   **Amazon (AMZN)**: Despite slower growth in the last year compared to smaller tech companies, Amazon is a high-quality business whose adoption was accelerated by the lockdown <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:24">[00:12:24]</a>. It's trading at 12-15 times free cash flow, which is considered low for its quality, as it should be closer to 30 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>.
*   **Alibaba (BABA)**: This stock is particularly popular, with 8 prominent investors buying it <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:40">[00:13:40]</a>. Notably, Charlie Munger, [[investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]]'s partner, invested 20% of his portfolio through his company, Daily Journal <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:00">[00:14:00]</a>. This investment is likely influenced by Li Lu, a manager Munger entrusts with his money, who is highly knowledgeable about the Chinese stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:36">[00:14:36]</a>. Alibaba is expected to grow at 20% annually through 2023, has no debt, and holds $100 billion in liquidity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:49">[00:17:49]</a>. Its current valuation is less than 20 times earnings, and its free cash flow per share is estimated at $10 this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>. With a projected increase in earnings per share to $13-14 and continued cash generation, its future valuation could range from $350-$500 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:09">[00:20:09]</a>.
*   **Microsoft (MSFT)**: Many [[famous_investors_and_their_principles | famous investors]] like Terry Smith and Steve Mandel hold Microsoft due to its significant competitive advantages, high technology integration, and network effects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:56">[00:22:56]</a>. The company's shift to a cloud-based business model has allowed it to raise prices more aggressively, leading to expanding margins and strong earnings per share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:23:22">[00:23:22]</a>. Microsoft is projected to earn almost $8 per share by June this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:08">[00:24:08]</a>. Its ability to generate significant free cash flow and return capital through share buybacks (at 3-5% annually) contributes to an estimated 16% earnings per share growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:44">[00:25:44]</a>. Microsoft rarely trades below 25 times earnings, and with projected earnings of $16-18 by late 2025, its target price could range from $400-500 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:55">[00:26:55]</a>.
*   **Facebook (FB)**: Was the most popular stock purchased this quarter <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:38">[00:27:38]</a>.

## The Role of Small and Lesser-Known Stocks

While large, well-known stocks are popular, small and lesser-known companies can often yield better results for private investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:32">[00:01:32]</a>. This is because managers of smaller funds manage less capital, allowing them to invest in companies that are too small for larger, more famous investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:38">[00:01:38]</a>. This provides an advantage to private investors, who can achieve better returns even with less initial knowledge due to not managing vast amounts of capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>.

### Notable Small-Cap Investors & Their Holdings

*   **Adam Weeden (ADW Capital)**: An emerging manager who has achieved 28% annual returns for his shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:00">[00:29:00]</a>. He has a highly concentrated, high-conviction investment style, often holding only a few stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:46">[00:30:46]</a>. Examples include:
    *   **PAR Technology (PAR)**: A company providing payment terminals and cloud-based systems for restaurants <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:09">[00:31:09]</a>.
    *   **Up and Group (UPG)**: A SPAC (Special Purpose Acquisition Company) that has successfully acquired industrial services companies, particularly in fire safety and building maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:34">[00:31:34]</a>. The business model is non-cyclical and growing at 7% annually, with acquisitions adding another 5-10% growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:40">[00:34:40]</a>. The company's free cash flow per share is estimated at $1.50 this year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:09">[00:36:09]</a>.
    *   **Waste Connections (WCN)**: A waste and garbage collection company in a stable sector with no debt, growing through acquisitions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:50">[00:31:50]</a>.
    *   **Playboy (PLBY)**: Gaining excitement due to its historical library and NFT potential <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:03">[00:32:03]</a>.
*   **Turtle Creek Asset Management**: A Canadian fund with spectacular results, turning $1 into $65 over 20 years, an average annual return of 19% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:54">[00:49:54]</a>. They focus on traditional value companies that are cheap but have growth potential, often holding around 20 stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:49:43">[00:49:43]</a>.
    *   **Berry Global (BERY)**: A plastic packaging manufacturing company that, despite negative perceptions of plastics, operates in a stable sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:39">[00:51:39]</a>. 70% of its products are for stable categories like food and beverages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:52:47">[00:52:47]</a>. The company has grown its free cash flow from $240 million to $940 million and earnings per share from $1 to $5 in seven years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:24">[00:53:24]</a>. It's valued cheaply at 10 times free cash flow, while similar growth in tech companies would command 40-50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:53">[00:53:53]</a>. The local nature of plastics manufacturing creates competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:30">[00:54:30]</a>.

## Other Investment Strategies & Market Dynamics

*   **Ray Dalio (Bridgewater Associates)**: The world's largest investment fund, known for a macroeconomic investment style <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:46:55">[00:46:55]</a>. Recent movements suggest a bearish view on inflation, selling gold and emerging markets ETFs, and buying consumer staples like Procter & Gamble, Coca-Cola, Johnson & Johnson, and Walmart <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:46">[00:47:46]</a>. These consumer stocks typically perform well when there is no inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:32">[00:48:32]</a>. This indicates a repositioning based on his economic outlook <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:48:57">[00:48:57]</a>.
*   **Cathie Wood (ARK Invest)**: Her [[Key stocks in Cathie Woods portfolio | ARKK ETF]] focuses on high-growth stocks, including Twitter and Baidu <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:57">[00:40:57]</a>. Baidu is considered undervalued similar to Alibaba, despite slower growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:14">[00:41:14]</a>.
*   **Momentum Indices**: These indices, which track stocks in fashion, have been rebalancing, excluding most technology stocks and adding many financial stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. This creates forced buying interest for short-term funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:46">[00:09:46]</a>.
*   **Index Inclusion Impact**: A company's inclusion in an index (e.g., Nagarro in the DAX index for German small companies) can lead to forced buying by ETFs and passive funds tracking that index, causing a temporary stock price increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:51">[01:00:51]</a>.
*   **Spin-offs**: These corporate actions, where a new independent company is created from an existing parent company, have generally performed well <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:03">[00:58:03]</a>. Websites like `spinoffinvesting.com` can be used to track them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:03">[01:00:03]</a>.

*   **RCI (Rent-A-Center)**: A company that rents goods to customers with high interest rates (20-30%). These businesses can be risky if credit quality is not managed carefully <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:45">[01:40:45]</a>.
*   **Uranium Sector (e.g., Cameco)**: This sector is seen as interesting due to the relatively low current price of uranium compared to its historical average <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:13">[01:27:13]</a>. Raw material companies offer high leverage, meaning small increases in commodity prices can lead to significant profit gains <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:28:10">[01:28:10]</a>.

## General Investment Principles

*   **Long-Term Focus**: Investments should be viewed with a long-term perspective, as short-term market reactions can be misleading <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:04">[01:03:04]</a>.
*   **Quality of Advice**: When seeking investment education, prioritize instructors with audited track records and professional qualifications, rather than those who make unsubstantiated claims <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:21">[00:37:21]</a>.
*   **Transparency**: Fund managers should be transparent about their holdings and rationale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:38">[00:03:38]</a>.
*   **Avoiding Scams**: Be wary of claims of "free money" from bots or pyramid schemes, as these are typically fraudulent <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:16">[01:07:16]</a>.
*   **Emotional Detachment**: Do not become emotionally attached to positions; be willing to sell if the investment thesis no longer holds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:34:29">[01:34:29]</a>.
*   **Patience**: Opportunities arise when stocks are cheap, not necessarily after they have already risen significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:39:40">[01:39:40]</a>.

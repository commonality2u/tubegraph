## Recent Major Investment: Berkshire Hathaway Stock Buyback

During a recent quarter, [[Warren Buffetts latest investment moves | Warren Buffett]] made a substantial investment of over $9 billion by buying back shares of his own company, Berkshire Hathaway <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:36">[00:09:36]</a>. Berkshire Hathaway shares are traded on the stock exchange under the ticker BR and were priced at $230 per share at the time of the discussion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:43">[00:09:43]</a>.

### Rationale Behind the Buyback

[[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] explained his rationale for acquiring more of Berkshire Hathaway's shares in a statement to investors:
<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:58">[00:09:58]</a>
> "Bershire's shares are trading below their real value, and over time we want the number of shares outstanding to be smaller. If the difference between value and listing price continues to widen, we will be more aggressive in buying back shares." <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>

This statement indicates that [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]] and [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Charlie Munger]] believe the company's shares are undervalued in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:10">[00:10:10]</a>.

[!NOTE]
The primary objective of these buybacks is to cancel the acquired shares, thereby increasing the percentage of ownership for remaining shareholders and, consequently, the value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:28">[00:10:28]</a>. The significant $9 billion purchase signals [[Warren Buffetts investment strategies | Warren Buffett]]'s conviction that Berkshire Hathaway's shares are trading below their intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:38">[00:10:38]</a>.

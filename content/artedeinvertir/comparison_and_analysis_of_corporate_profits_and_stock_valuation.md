Understanding how stock prices are determined by corporate profits and valuation multiples is crucial for [[analyzing_stock_market_investments | analyzing stock market investments]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:54">[00:03:54]</a>. Michael Burry, a well-known investor, recently shared his vision for the stock market's future, highlighting the significance of these two variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:13">[00:00:13]</a>.

## Stock Pricing Fundamentals

A stock's price is a function of two primary variables:
*   **Earnings per share (EPS)** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>
*   **Valuation multiple** (e.g., Price-to-Earnings ratio or P/E) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:03">[00:04:03]</a>

This relationship determines the listed price of a stock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:07">[00:04:07]</a>. While profits generally tend to rise for good companies, the [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation multiple]] can fluctuate based on market sentiment, economic conditions, future prospects, and interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:09">[00:04:09]</a>.

## Multiple Compression in H1 2022

In the first half of the year, the S&P 500 fell by 25-26% (inflation-adjusted), and the Nasdaq fell by 30-35% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:39">[00:03:39]</a>. This phenomenon is known as "multiple compression" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The negative perception of the future, driven by inflation and uncertainty, combined with rising interest rates, has negatively impacted both variables <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. When the minimum rate of return set by the central bank is high, shares tend to trade at a lower [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation multiple]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

According to a breakdown by JP Morgan, in the first half of 2022:
*   Company profits still grew by 6% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:02">[00:05:02]</a>.
*   [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | Valuation multiples]] compressed by 27% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:05">[00:05:05]</a>.
*   This led to an overall market decline of -21% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.

Historically, while earnings (blue line) tend to grow over time, [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation multiples]] (yellow area) fluctuate between neutral zones (average 16x earnings) and periods of euphoria or depression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Periods of euphoria are often followed by contraction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:54">[00:05:54]</a>.

### Michael Burry's Prediction: The "Second Leg" Down

Michael Burry suggests that the first half of the year saw multiple compression, and the "second part" or "second leg" of the market fall will be the compression of corporate profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>. This is anticipated due to an almost certain recession in the U.S. and persistent high inflation (9.1%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:57">[00:06:57]</a>.

He predicted widespread panic around the July 26-27 Fed meeting, where a historic rate hike of 75 or even 100 basis points was expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>. Higher interest rates negatively impact companies by increasing the cost of money for debt and new projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Burry believes the market is only "halfway through the fall" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:09">[00:10:09]</a>.

## Quantifying the Potential Fall

The S&P 500 peaked at around 4,800 points in 2022 and has since fallen by 1,000 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:05">[01:11:05]</a>. This 1,000-point drop primarily reflects multiple compression <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:33">[01:11:33]</a>.

Historically, in recessions, corporate profits have seen significant declines:
*   Dot-com bubble (2000): Earnings compressed by 20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:42">[00:08:42]</a>.
*   Mild recession: Profits fall around 9-10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:35">[01:06:35]</a>.
*   Severe recession: Profits can fall up to 24% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:40">[01:06:40]</a>.
*   Average/median profit fall in recessions: 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.

If the S&P 500's normalized earnings per share are 225 dollars, a 20% drop (mild recession) would bring them to 175 dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:37">[01:11:37]</a>. If current P/E multiples (around 15-16x) are applied to these lower earnings, the S&P 500 could target 2,800 points from its current 3,600-3,700 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:59">[01:11:59]</a>.

### Possible Scenarios for the S&P 500

A matrix of scenarios considering different [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation multiples]] and corporate profit levels:
*   **S&P 500 current**: 3,700 points <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:27">[01:27:27]</a>.
*   **Corporate profits scenarios**: Mild recession (210), Severe recession (175), No recession (230) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:27:40">[01:27:40]</a>.
*   **Valuation multiples**: Could drop further to 13x earnings (like the dot-com crisis), leading to a target of 2,300, an additional 30% fall <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:29:57">[01:29:57]</a>.
*   **Worst-case scenario (2008-like)**: P/E of 9x earnings could lead to an S&P 500 target of 1,400 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:15">[01:31:15]</a>. This illustrates the potential for 50% losses in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:32:00">[01:32:00]</a>.

## Sectoral Impact on Corporate Profits

Not all sectors behave the same during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:56:57">[01:56:57]</a>. A Goldman Sachs study from the last 40 years indicates:
*   **Most affected**: Materials (e.g., copper, aluminum, steel producers) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:11">[01:57:11]</a>.
*   **Discretionary consumption**: (e.g., cars, houses, large appliances) also suffers significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:23">[01:57:23]</a>.
*   **Financial and Energy sectors**: Tend to suffer a lot <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:05">[01:58:05]</a>.
*   **Technology**: Profits generally don't decrease much; the fall has been more due to [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | multiple compression]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:27">[01:58:27]</a>.
*   **Stable consumption**: (e.g., toothpaste, essential goods from companies like Procter & Gamble, Unilever, Nestl√©) may even see increased profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:57:42">[01:57:42]</a>.
*   **Utilities and Healthcare**: Tend to increase profits or are very defensive <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:41">[01:58:41]</a>.

## Investor Sentiment and Market Performance

Consumer sentiment, as measured by the University of Michigan survey, is currently at its lowest point <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:18:16">[02:18:16]</a>. Historically, very low periods of consumer sentiment have preceded recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:39:58">[02:39:58]</a>.

*   **When consumer sentiment is low**: The market performs best. For example, in 1980, the S&P 500 returned 20% annually after a period of negativity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:45:10">[02:45:10]</a>. After the 2008 crisis and April 2020, periods of negative sentiment led to extraordinary returns (+43% in 2020) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:50:00">[02:50:00]</a>.
*   **When consumer sentiment is euphoric**: This is dangerous. In January 2000 (before the dot-com crash) and January 2015, euphoric sentiment led to negative subsequent returns (-2% and -27% respectively) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:52">[02:56:52]</a>.

This pattern suggests that market corrections are often driven by sentiment and [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | multiple compression]], even if corporate profits don't fall drastically <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:22:20">[02:22:20]</a>.

## Small Caps vs. Large Caps and Equity Risk Premium

While large companies tend to fall less in market downturns, small-cap companies (small caps) typically experience larger average falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:27:54">[02:27:54]</a>. On average, small caps have fallen 35% during recessions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:29:58">[02:29:58]</a>. Despite greater [[stock_market_volatility_and_valuation_analysis | volatility]], history shows small caps to be more profitable in the long term, especially during recoveries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:35:05">[02:35:05]</a>.

The **Equity Risk Premium (ERP)** is a key indicator:
*   It measures the excess return of equities over the risk-free rate (e.g., 10-year bond yield) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:54:21">[02:54:21]</a>.
*   When ERP is high (like now, around 800 basis points, double the usual 400), it's the best time to invest because stocks are offered cheaply due to fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:07:46">[03:07:46]</a>.
*   The market is currently offering small caps at 11 times earnings, much cheaper than typical 15 times earnings, reflecting this fear <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:39:40">[03:39:40]</a>.

## Investment Philosophy and Opportunities

Investors like Warren Buffett and Daniel Loeb are finding [[analyzing_stock_opportunities | opportunities]] in the current market:
*   **Warren Buffett** is aggressively accumulating shares of Occidental Petroleum, an oil extraction company with very low extraction costs, trading at 6 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:10:50">[04:10:50]</a>. He seeks companies that return money to shareholders through dividends or buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:47:10">[04:47:10]</a>.
*   **Daniel Loeb** is investing in high-quality, defensive companies like Danaher (an industrial holding company with recurring revenue and pricing power) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:50:58">[04:50:58]</a> and PG&E (a California electricity generator trading at a low 9 times earnings due to past legal issues) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:51:30">[05:51:30]</a>.

They emphasize that investing in the stock market requires:
*   **Independent thinking**: Not getting carried away by market sentiment or the masses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:00">[02:00:00]</a>.
*   **Knowledge**: Informing oneself, learning, and analyzing correctly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:16:16">[02:16:16]</a>.
*   **Patience**: Especially during "accumulation periods" when stocks are down and people are not interested <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:47:00">[02:47:00]</a>.
*   **Preparation for volatility**: Being ready to temporarily lose 50% of money, as even legendary investors like Warren Buffett have experienced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:40:00">[01:40:00]</a>.

![[chart-equity-risk-premium.png]]
This chart shows that a high Equity Risk Premium (when the blue line is high) corresponds to future high returns for the S&P 500, indicating good buying opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:51:32">[02:51:32]</a>.

In conclusion, while the market faces challenges from potential corporate profit compression, these periods of negativity and fear often present significant [[analyzing_stock_opportunities | opportunities]] for informed, patient investors to build wealth over the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:37">[02:37:37]</a>.

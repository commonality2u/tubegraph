The global economy is currently facing a period of significant change, with central banks directly stating that an [[Challenges of economic recession | economic recession]] is imminent in the first quarter of 2023 for the eurozone, and that the danger of recession is quite high in the United States [00:01:00]. This economic shift marks the beginning of a new era for investment strategies, as outlined by Howard Marx, with implications for how different sectors and investment styles will perform [00:00:29].

## Indicators of Imminent Recession

Several leading economic indicators suggest an impending recession:
*   **New Industrial Orders:** In the United States, the number of new industrial orders has historically signaled recession when it crosses a specific threshold, as seen in 2000-2001, 2008, and 2020. The current data places it in the "danger zone" [00:02:20].
*   **Housing Affordability:** The ease of purchasing housing in the U.S. is at levels comparable to those preceding the 2007-2008 financial crisis, largely due to a significant rise in interest rates [00:03:20]. The real estate sector plays a major role in the overall economy [00:03:36].
*   **Consumer Savings and Debt:** While COVID-19 initially led to a surge in personal savings, these savings have been depleted by economic reopening and inflation. Personal savings levels are now similar to those seen during the 2008 crisis, accompanied by high levels of credit card, personal loan, and mortgage debt [00:15:10].

Lagging indicators like unemployment and GDP, which are often focused on by the public, do not provide an advance warning of recession [00:03:03].

## Sector Performance During Recession and Recovery

Understanding how different sectors perform during varying economic cycles is crucial for [[Investment strategies during economic downturns | investment strategies]].
*   **During Economic Contraction (Recession):**
    *   **Discretionary Consumption:** Curiously, sectors like discretionary consumption (e.g., automobile companies) tend to perform well during recessionary periods. This is because the market often anticipates future recovery, and the sales of these companies rebound significantly in the subsequent recovery phase [00:17:09].
    *   **Underperforming Sectors:** Historically, technology stocks have performed poorly during economic contractions, as evidenced by significant drops in 2022. Industrial companies may also struggle [00:17:40].
    *   **Energy Sector:** The energy sector's performance can vary. If the recession is partly caused by energy inflation, as in the current environment, the sector may perform well [00:17:52].
*   **During Economic Recovery (Rebound):**
    *   **General Improvement:** Most sectors generally perform well during a rebound period [00:18:00].
    *   **Safer Sectors:** Health, energy, and utilities, which are considered safer and do not suffer as much during crises, may not see as much benefit from the recovery compared to other sectors [00:18:05].

## Paradigm Shifts in Investment Strategies

Howard Marx identifies three "transcendental changes" in the market's structure over 50 years, with the current period representing the third significant shift. These shifts fundamentally alter what [[Investment strategies during an economic crisis | investment strategies]] are effective [00:05:04].

### 1. Passive vs. Active Investment
Since the 2008 financial crisis, there has been a significant rise in passive or indexed investment. While active investment involves selecting individual stocks (e.g., a portfolio of 10-20 stocks), passive investment entails buying broad market indices like the S&P 500 or MSCI World [00:07:34]. The ease of access to capital and a broadly rising market created a "self-fulfilling prophecy" where more people flocked to index investing as indices rose [00:08:17]. This led to massive capital inflows into passive strategies and outflows from active strategies, creating a divergence that some, like Michael Burry, have warned about [00:08:46].

### 2. Growth vs. Value Investment Styles
The past 13 years have seen strong performance from the "growth" investment style, characterized by companies with high revenue growth, even if not immediately profitable or relying on issuing shares to finance losses [00:09:52]. This peaked in 2021 with euphoria around stocks like Peloton and Shopify [00:10:05].

In contrast, "value" investing, which focuses on buying companies for less than their intrinsic worth and often prioritizes profitability, has been less favored. Value investing emphasizes businesses that generate cash flow, have sound management, and return money to shareholders [00:36:31]. The current market environment, however, suggests a shift back towards value, as many previously high-flying growth stocks (e.g., Carvana, Coinbase) have experienced significant declines [00:37:38].

### 3. Small Caps vs. Large Caps
Historically, small-cap companies have often provided higher returns than large companies due to less analyst coverage, lower liquidity, and greater growth potential [00:11:41]. However, since 2008, large companies, particularly those included in major indices, have significantly outperformed small caps. For example, the S&P 500 doubled its value, while the Russell 2000 (small-cap index) only increased by 50% over a similar period [00:12:18]. This divergence suggests a potential shift where small caps, currently much cheaper than large companies, could become more favored [00:12:51].

*   **Example (Packaging Sector):**
    *   **Grupeillín (Small Cap):** A small European company (370 million market cap) that makes packaging for the stable food sector. It's not in major indices, has low liquidity, but has consistent growth (5% annually), strong cash flow, and low debt (0.5 times EBITDA) [00:22:31]. It trades at significantly lower valuations (e.g., 8 times earnings) compared to larger peers [00:26:00].
    *   **J Maki (Large Cap):** A Finnish company 10 times larger than Grupeillín, also making plastic containers (e.g., McDonald's lids). It has similar growth (6% annually) and profits but trades at a 60% higher valuation (12 times earnings), benefiting from its inclusion in major indices and higher liquidity [00:24:59].

### 4. United States vs. International Markets
In recent years, U.S. stocks have significantly outperformed international markets. The dominance of major U.S. technology companies (e.g., FANGs) within indices heavily influenced this performance [00:32:31]. The S&P 500 achieved a 230% return over 12 years, while European and emerging markets saw only 50% gains in the same period [00:13:21]. However, some of these U.S. giants are now experiencing slowing growth or declines [00:32:44]. Howard Marx now suggests that international stocks are poised to perform better [00:13:17], as they trade at a significant discount (e.g., 10 times earnings compared to the U.S. at 15 times earnings or higher) [01:06:00].

*   **Example (Digital Engineering):**
    *   **Globan (U.S. Large Cap):** A large U.S. digital engineering company (7 billion market cap) that historically grew 30% in sales and 25% in profits, but has seen its stock price fall from highs [00:34:17].
    *   **Nagarro (International Small Cap):** A smaller German-listed company in the same sector. Despite having higher growth (40-35% this year) and similar debt levels, it trades at a significantly lower valuation (e.g., 11 times EBITDA vs. Globan's 16-30 times) because it is smaller and not in major U.S. indices [00:34:50].

These shifts highlight that strategies successful in the past 13 years may no longer be applicable in the future [00:06:54]. The market is now witnessing situations where high-quality companies, particularly small caps and international stocks, are trading at historically low valuations, creating potential opportunities for investors who understand these paradigm changes [00:21:10].

BlackRock is a company often described as the "owner of the world" due to its immense influence <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. This article explores [[blackrocks_influence_on_the_global_economy | BlackRock's influence on the global economy]] and its [[blackrocks_investment_strategies_and_influence_on_markets | investment strategies and influence on markets]], particularly within financial systems.

## BlackRock's Tremendous Power and Scale

BlackRock controls over $10 trillion in assets, making it the largest shareholder in many major listed companies worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:12">[00:00:12]</a>. To put its size into context, these controlled assets represent more than 10% of the world economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>, exceeding the economies of all countries except China and the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:25">[00:00:25]</a>.

The company is led by CEO Larry Fink, considered one of the most economically powerful individuals globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:12">[00:01:12]</a>. BlackRock's primary objective, like any private company, is to generate profits for its investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:23">[00:01:23]</a>.

## Client Base and Funding Mechanisms

BlackRock's clients primarily consist of banks, insurers, pension plans, and sovereign funds from some of the wealthiest countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:35">[00:01:35]</a>. However, a significant portion of its funding also comes from small investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:43">[00:01:43]</a>. Many individuals' savings, directly or indirectly, end up as part of BlackRock's managed assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:43">[00:00:43]</a>. Investment plans offered by banks often channel client money into BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>, and even uninvested deposits in banks may be invested by the bank, potentially ending up in BlackRock products <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## [[blackrocks_control_over_listed_companies_and_banks | BlackRock's Control over Listed Companies and Banks]]

BlackRock maintains significant control over the financial sector, which is seen as the "lung of the economy" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:48">[00:01:48]</a>. It holds majority positions in major global banks, including Wells Fargo, Bank of America, Citigroup, and Banco Santander <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:53">[00:01:53]</a>. Most of these banks are also BlackRock's main clients, continuously providing more capital, which in turn increases BlackRock's controlling stake in major companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:02">[00:02:02]</a>.

BlackRock uses "iShares" as its commercial name to channel investments and own these companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:37">[00:02:37]</a>. A self-check on financial websites like Yahoo Finance's "holders" tab for major listed companies often reveals BlackRock or iShares as significant shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:52">[00:02:52]</a>.

### BlackRock Solutions and Conflicts of Interest

BlackRock has a controversial division called BlackRock Solutions, which audits and controls potential risks that major global banks pose to the financial system <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>. This gives BlackRock intimate knowledge of banks' internal accounts and data <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:01">[00:04:01]</a>. This is paradoxical, as BlackRock is simultaneously a main investor in these banks and responsible for auditing their internal risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:06">[00:04:06]</a>. BlackRock claims these are separate companies with "Chinese walls" to control information <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:21">[00:04:21]</a>.

## Influence on Markets and Global Affairs

BlackRock's power extends beyond investment management. During the 2008 [[reverse_financial_crisis_and_its_implications | financial crisis]], the Federal Reserve commissioned BlackRock to dismantle failed banks like Lehman Brothers and Bear Stearns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:16">[00:05:16]</a>. It is also a primary lender to emerging countries, further extending its control globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:32">[00:05:32]</a>.

The company earns approximately 80% of its income by advising on financial products like iShares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>. BlackRock created ETFs (Exchange Traded Funds) that are easily bought and sold like stocks, making it simpler for the general public to invest in the entire market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:49">[00:05:49]</a>. It is estimated that 60% of money invested in the United States is now passive, often in products like BlackRock's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:00">[00:06:00]</a>.

### Concentration of Power and [[ethical_and_competitive_concerns_related_to_blackrocks_power | Ethical and Competitive Concerns]]

A significant problem arising from this investment style is the question of who truly controls companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>. Investors in BlackRock's products delegate voting rights to BlackRock, concentrating power in very few companies that ultimately control major listed entities worldwide <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:12">[00:06:12]</a>. This creates circular structures where client funds empower BlackRock to control key companies, which in turn provide more funds, further increasing its power <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.

This accumulation of power also generates potential conflicts of interest regarding competition between companies controlled by BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:44">[00:06:44]</a>. For example, BlackRock is a major shareholder in competing companies within the same sector, such as the automobile, airline, and financial sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:16">[00:07:16]</a>. This raises questions about the freedom of competition in these sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:22">[00:07:22]</a>.

BlackRock and Vanguard together control over $15 trillion in assets, comparable to the American economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:01">[00:08:01]</a>. These two companies are the main shareholders of 85% of the primary listed companies globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:10">[00:08:10]</a>. BlackRock also exerts power in the media sector, controlling an estimated 95% of traditional and new generation media, including Facebook, as major shareholders <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:20">[00:08:20]</a>. In 2021, BlackRock leveraged public pressure to influence companies like ExxonMobil, one of the world's largest oil companies, to commit to reducing CO2 emissions to net zero by 2050 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:37">[00:08:37]</a>.

## Investing in BlackRock

BlackRock is publicly listed on the stock market under the ticker BLK, trading at around $700 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:05">[00:09:05]</a>. Since its listing in 2000, BlackRock shares have multiplied by over 50 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:13">[00:09:13]</a>. The trend of passive investment is expected to continue, with BlackRock capitalizing on this growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:24">[00:09:24]</a>. Significant capital inflows have been directed towards ETF products like BlackRock's iShares, at the expense of traditional active investment funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:31">[00:09:31]</a>. BlackRock itself anticipates annual growth of 15% through 2025, much higher than the average for listed companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:41">[00:09:41]</a>.

BlackRock treats its shareholders well, returning over 75% of its earnings through dividends or share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:51">[00:09:51]</a>. Its dividends have increased by 18% per year, contributing to its stock market performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Impact of Inflation on BlackRock

Inflation could have a neutral or even positive effect on BlackRock's results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a>. Since BlackRock charges a percentage on the value of its listed ETFs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>, if the nominal value of these ETFs increases due to inflation, BlackRock's commissions will be higher while its costs may not increase proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:34">[00:10:34]</a>. In environments with high inflation, the nominal value of financial assets tends to increase, leading to higher commissions for BlackRock <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:41">[00:10:41]</a>.

BlackRock's current valuation of 23 times earnings is higher than its historical average of 18 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:07">[00:11:07]</a>, reflecting investors' willingness to pay a higher price as the company becomes more widely known <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:14">[00:11:14]</a>. It is considered a high-quality company with above-average growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>.

## Risks of Passive Investment and Investor Advice

The trend of simplifying investments by buying all listed companies through ETFs or passive funds is potentially creating a [[reverse_financial_crisis_and_its_implications | financial bubble]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:58">[00:11:58]</a>. Noted investors like Michael Burry, who predicted the 2008 financial crisis, have warned that passive investing and ETFs represent a "huge bubble" due to high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:09">[00:12:09]</a>.

The mechanism of these ETFs forces automated buying of more shares when a stock rises and gains relative weight within an index, further inflating valuations and attracting more passive investment capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:27">[00:12:27]</a>. This can lead to discrepancies in the market, with some companies becoming very expensive and others undervalued because they are not part of these indices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:46">[00:12:46]</a>.

Michael Burry has cautioned that this investment style will face issues when capital outflows exceed inflows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:03">[00:13:03]</a>. The larger the bubble, the more new money is required to sustain high valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:11">[00:13:11]</a>.

### Investor Advice

It is crucial for investors to take full responsibility for their investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:39">[00:11:39]</a>. This includes understanding where money is invested, the commissions paid, expected risks and returns, and who is managing the funds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. Continuous education and learning about the financial system are key, as it can appear complex at first <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:53">[00:11:53]</a>.

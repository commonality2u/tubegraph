To succeed in [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | investment]], it is crucial to pay less than what one believes an asset is worth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>. The challenge lies in accurately calculating that worth, often referred to as [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:24">[00:00:24]</a>. A key factor in this calculation, and often overlooked in simpler [[valuation_metrics_and_considerations_for_stock_investments | valuation metrics]], is a company's debt.

## Methods of Stock Valuation

### Intrinsic Value and Discounted Cash Flows (DCF)
Academically, [[intrinsic_value_in_stock_valuation | intrinsic value]] is defined by discounted cash flows (DCF), which involves discounting a company's projected lifetime earnings at an appropriate rate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:29">[00:01:29]</a>. However, this method is more an art than a science, as predicting a company's earnings for ten or fifteen years is impossible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. The immediate five years of profit have a very small impact on the final DCF valuation, making it less practical in the real world <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>.

### Valuation by Multiples
Given the limitations of DCF, [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | valuation by multiples]] is often employed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:21">[00:03:21]</a>. This approach aims to predict earnings over a more visible 3-5 year horizon, with valuations updated over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:28">[00:03:28]</a>. There are multiple options for this, including Price-to-Earnings (P/E), EV/EBITDA, net asset value, and multiples based on cash flows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:49">[00:03:49]</a>.

### Price-to-Earnings (P/E) Ratio
The most common method for valuing shares is the P/E ratio, which is calculated by dividing the stock price (or market capitalization) by the company's annual net accounting profit or earnings per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:02">[00:04:02]</a>. For example, if a company lists at 27 euros and earns 1 euro per share, its P/E is 27 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:00">[00:05:00]</a>.

While a high P/E might indicate investor expectation of significant future earnings growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a>, a low P/E could signal a [[value_traps_in_investing | value trap]], where future profits might decline, making the actual price paid much higher <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:16">[00:06:16]</a>. Companies trading at low P/E ratios, especially large-cap companies, might be discounting a future problem that investors anticipate <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:39">[00:06:39]</a>. Different industries also have different P/E expectations; for instance, automotive or airline companies rarely trade above 8-10 times P/E, while high-quality companies might trade above 18-20 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.

However, a significant problem with the P/E ratio is its failure to account for a company's debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:34">[00:09:34]</a>. Companies with substantial debt might appear to have a very low P/E (e.g., 4x or 5x), but this is due to the debt problem <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>. P/E only values the equity or net worth of the company, disregarding how much money the company owes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:57">[00:09:57]</a>.

### EV/EBITDA Ratio: Accounting for Debt
Unlike P/E, the EV/EBITDA method *does* take into account the company's capital structure, which includes both equity and liabilities (debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. This method has shown strong results, with consistently buying cheaper companies based on this multiple yielding an annual return of 15% over the last 20 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:47">[00:10:47]</a>. It is considered more useful than P/E for identifying undervalued opportunities <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

The EV/EBITDA ratio is calculated as:
$$
\text{EV/EBITDA} = \frac{\text{Market Capitalization + Financial Debt}}{\text{EBITDA}}
$$
Here, financial debt specifically refers to interest-bearing debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:18">[00:13:18]</a>. Market capitalization and financial debt are added in the numerator to represent the Enterprise Value (EV), which is essentially the total value of the company, including both equity and debt <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:09">[00:14:09]</a>. The denominator, EBITDA (Earnings Before Interest, Taxes, Depreciation, and Amortization), is a measure of a company's operating performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>.

This method allows investors to arrive at the total value of a company's assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:54">[00:14:54]</a>. By subtracting debt from this asset value, one can determine the equity value, which is what is bought on the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:17">[00:15:17]</a>.

For example, if a company is expected to earn 1.5 billion in EBITDA and is valued at 10 times EBITDA, the total asset valuation is 15 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:48">[00:15:48]</a>. If the company owes 3 billion in debt, subtracting this from the asset value gives an equity value of 12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:27">[00:16:27]</a>. Dividing this by the number of shares yields the target price per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:45">[00:16:45]</a>.

EV/EBITDA is particularly effective in [[comparison_and_analysis_of_corporate_profits_and_stock_valuation | relative valuation]]â€”comparing similar companies within an industry <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>. Different industries will trade at different EV/EBITDA multiples due to varying capital intensity and depreciation needs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:49">[00:18:49]</a>. For instance, raw materials extraction companies might trade at around 6 times EBITDA, while supermarkets might trade at 9 times, and high-quality consumer goods companies like Procter & Gamble or Unilever rarely go below 12-13 times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:52">[00:18:52]</a>.

### Price-to-Book (P/B) Value
The Price-to-Book (P/B) ratio compares the market price per share to the company's book value per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:34">[00:19:34]</a>. While simple to use by referring to a company's balance sheet, its effectiveness varies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:54">[00:19:54]</a>. Businesses based on intangible assets like brands (e.g., Coca-Cola, Pepsi) often trade at very high P/B multiples because their true value isn't fully captured in their accounting books <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:20:26">[00:20:26]</a>. Conversely, companies with significant tangible assets, such as maritime transport or banks, tend to trade at much lower P/B values, often closer to their book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:21:12">[00:21:12]</a>. Buying a company below its book value can provide a margin of safety, but it's essential to assess the true quality and value of the underlying assets beyond their stated book value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:07">[00:22:07]</a>.

### Other Valuation Methods
*   **Net Asset Value (NAV)**: Used for companies that own easily valued financial assets (like shares in other listed companies). The value is calculated by summing the value of these assets and dividing by the number of shares, often listed at a discount to reflect liquidation concerns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:22:43">[00:22:43]</a>.
*   **Sum of the Parts (SOTP)**: Applicable for companies with diverse business lines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:13">[00:24:13]</a>. It involves valuing each business segment separately using appropriate multiples (e.g., P/E or EV/EBITDA), then summing them up and dividing by the total shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:24:26">[00:24:26]</a>.

### Variations of Multiples
There are also variations of these methods, such as EV/EBIT, EV/EBITDAR (which incorporates rents, treating them like a type of debt) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:11">[00:25:11]</a>, and Price/Free Cash Flow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:23">[00:26:23]</a>. These advanced methods often provide a more refined view of a company's financial health and valuation by further considering a company's debt obligations and capital expenditures <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:31">[00:26:31]</a>.

In conclusion, understanding and incorporating a company's debt into valuation methods, particularly through ratios like EV/EBITDA, is paramount for a comprehensive and accurate assessment of its true worth, guiding better [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | investment strategies]].

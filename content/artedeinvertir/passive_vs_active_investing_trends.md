The current economic climate, particularly the imminent economic recession in the Eurozone and the United States in the first quarter of 2023, signals a transcendental change in investment strategies [00:00:14](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:14">[00:00:14]</a>, [00:00:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:29">[00:00:29]</a>). Howard Marx, a renowned investor, believes that the investment strategies that performed well over the past 13 years will no longer be effective [00:06:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>). He identifies this as the third significant shift in the market structure in 50 years [00:05:26](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:26">[00:05:26]</a>).

## Key Shifts in Investment Strategies

Howard Marx highlights four major strategies that have been successful in the past 13 years but are expected to change [00:07:11](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:11">[00:07:11]</a>, [00:07:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>):

### 1. Rise of [[Passive investment trends and their impact on market stability|Passive or Indexed Investment]]
The first significant change since the 2008 crisis has been the surge in [[Passive investment trends and their impact on market stability|passive or indexed investment]] [00:07:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:34">[00:07:34]</a>, [00:07:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:41">[00:07:41]</a>). [[Investment strategies passive vs active investing|Active investment]] involves selecting individual shares, while passive investment means joining the market by buying all shares in an index like the S&P 500 [00:07:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:50">[00:07:50]</a>, [00:08:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:08">[00:08:08]</a>).

This trend became a "self-fulfilling prophecy" due to easy money policies, where the more indices rose, the more people invested in them [00:08:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:17">[00:08:17]</a>, [00:08:24](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:24">[00:08:24]</a>). Before 2008, both active and passive strategies attracted capital, but post-2008, active investment saw outflows of over a trillion dollars, while passive investment experienced substantial inflows [00:08:32](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:32">[00:08:32]</a>, [00:08:44](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:44">[00:08:44]</a>). This divergence was noted by Michael Burry, who warned about the [[Passive investing risks|risks of passive index investing]] [00:08:46](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:46">[00:08:46]</a>). While passive investing may perform well in the long term, unmet short-term expectations could lead to disappointment and a lack of performance [00:08:56](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:56">[00:08:56]</a>, [00:09:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:02">[00:09:02]</a>).

### 2. Shift in [[Investment Strategies for a Changing Economic Environment|Investment Styles]]: Growth vs. Value
The second change is in investment style. Recently, the "growth style," focusing on companies with high growth, even if not profitable and financed by issuing shares, has worked well [00:09:48](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:48">[00:09:48]</a>, [00:09:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>). This trend peaked in 2021, driven by euphoria around stocks like Tesla and Shopify [00:10:05](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>, [00:10:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>). However, this type of growth is often unsustainable [00:10:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>).

[[Value investing vs growth investing|Value investing]], which involves buying companies for less than their intrinsic worth, even if they have moderate but profitable growth, is expected to become more favorable [00:10:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:29">[00:10:29]</a>, [00:11:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:00">[00:11:00]</a>). During the 2008 paradigm shift, growth stocks became cheap, then extremely expensive, leading to a new cycle [00:11:20](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>, [00:11:29](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:29">[00:11:29]</a>).

### 3. Small Caps vs. Large Companies
Historically, small-cap companies have provided higher returns due to being less followed, having less liquidity, and greater growth potential [00:11:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:41">[00:11:41]</a>, [00:11:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:50">[00:11:50]</a>). However, since 2008, large companies (like those in the S&P 500) have significantly outperformed small-cap indices (like the Russell 2000) [00:12:02](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>, [00:12:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:10">[00:12:10]</a>). For example, the S&P 500 doubled, while the Russell 2000 rose only 50% over a decade [00:12:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:21">[00:12:21]</a>, [00:12:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:34">[00:12:34]</a>). This divergence is due to easy money and capital flow towards indexed investment [00:13:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:01">[00:13:01]</a>, [00:13:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:06">[00:13:06]</a>). A recovery in small caps is anticipated, as they are currently much cheaper than large companies [00:12:47](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:47">[00:12:47]</a>, [00:12:57](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:57">[00:12:57]</a>).

### 4. International vs. United States Stocks
In recent years, the United States market has outperformed the rest of the world [00:13:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:13">[00:13:13]</a>, [00:13:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>). The S&P 500 had a 230% return over 12 years, while European or emerging markets saw only about 50% [00:13:28](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:28">[00:13:28]</a>, [00:13:41](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:41">[00:13:41]</a>). This has led to a significant valuation divergence, with the rest of the world trading at a 25-30% discount compared to the United States [00:14:06](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:06">[00:14:06]</a>, [00:14:16](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:16">[00:14:16]</a>). Howard Marx now proposes the opposite: international stocks will likely do better than those in the United States [00:13:17](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>).

## Impact of Central Bank Policies

The "big theme" of recent years has been the printing of money by central banks, which significantly impacted the S&P 500 [00:05:36](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:36">[00:05:36]</a>, [00:05:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:40">[00:05:40]</a>). This new money entered the economy through easy credit and cheap government funding, creating a short-to-medium-term economic boom [00:05:50](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:50">[00:05:50]</a>, [00:06:01](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:01">[00:06:01]</a>). However, the opposite is now occurring, with forecasts of money withdrawal from the system, normalizing the balance sheet over the next two to three years [00:06:04](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:04">[00:06:04]</a>, [00:06:21](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:21">[00:06:21]</a>). This changed environment is what underpins Marx's new paradigm shift [00:06:27](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:27">[00:06:27]</a>).

## [[Current trends and future predictions in stock market and investments|Investment Implications]]
The market is entering a phase where past strategies may no longer work [00:06:54](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:54">[00:06:54]</a>). The withdrawal of liquidity by central banks affects companies with less liquidity, leading to "forced sales" unrelated to business performance [00:57:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:40">[00:57:40]</a>, [00:57:45](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:45">[00:57:45]</a>). This creates interesting opportunities, especially in small-cap companies, as market fear generalizes and pushes down prices of even stable businesses [00:57:51](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:57:51">[00:57:51]</a>, [00:58:52](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:52">[00:58:52]</a>).

For investors, adapting to these changes by focusing on undervalued businesses with strong fundamentals and predictable cash flow is crucial [00:06:40](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:40">[00:06:40]</a>, [03:00:00](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:00:00">[03:00:00]</a>). This is particularly true for small investors who can access opportunities that larger funds cannot due to liquidity constraints [02:11:10](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:11:10">[02:11:10]</a>, [02:13:13](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:13:13">[02:13:13]</a>). Learning to analyze companies and make decisions based on intrinsic value, rather than market sentiment or past trends, will be key to navigating the upcoming market cycles [01:03:34](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:03:34">[01:03:34]</a>, [01:08:08](<a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:08">[01:08:08]</a>).

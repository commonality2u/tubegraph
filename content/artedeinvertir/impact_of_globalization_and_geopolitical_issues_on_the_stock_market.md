Ray Dalio, a highly successful investor and manager of the world's largest investment fund, Bridgewater Associates, with over $130 billion in assets, has warned of a potential "lost decade" for the stock market and equities, characterized by low returns and high volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:04">[00:00:04]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:15">[00:00:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:56">[00:00:56]</a>. Often described as the "Steve Jobs of the financial markets" for his innovative approach to investments, Dalio's predictions warrant attention <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:18">[00:01:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:21">[00:02:21]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's "All Weather" Strategy
Dalio's main innovation in financial markets is his "All Weather" portfolio management system, also known as "the four seasons" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:41">[00:01:41]</a>. This system aims for predictable returns with low volatility rather than the highest returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:50">[00:01:50]</a>. It has historically provided an average annual return of 12% and limited losses to only 3% in difficult years like 2008, while the broader market fell by up to 40% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:57">[00:01:57]</a>.

## Declining Globalization and Supply Chain Reshoring
Ray Dalio's concern stems from the idea that globalization, which has been a primary driver of profitability in the developed world for decades, has reached its peak <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Due to [[geopolitical_tensions_and_their_economic_impact | geopolitical tensions]], such as the conflict between the U.S. and China, multinational corporations are shifting their focus from cost optimization to supply chain security, leading to reshoring of manufacturing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:40">[00:02:40]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:46">[00:02:46]</a>. Companies like Intel and TSM have already announced new factories in the U.S., despite higher manufacturing costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:51">[00:02:51]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:57">[00:02:57]</a>.

## Impact on Profit Margins and Corporate Debt
One of Dalio's major concerns is the impact of this shift on corporate profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:01">[00:03:01]</a>. Over the last 30 years, driven by cost optimization through globalization, profit margins of large companies have risen from 5% to 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:08">[00:03:08]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:12">[00:03:12]</a>. Since the evolution of earnings per share is the main factor determining a stock's future performance, a decline in profit margins could negatively affect the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.

Dalio also stated that even if corporate profits recover post-crisis, many companies will emerge with lower profit margins and increased indebtedness <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:20">[00:04:20]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:30">[00:04:30]</a>. Warren Buffett echoed this sentiment when explaining his sale of airline investments; while these companies might avoid bankruptcy, their future profits will be diverted to pay interest and repay debt instead of growing the business or rewarding shareholders through dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:33">[00:04:33]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:48">[00:04:48]</a>.

## Investment Opportunities in Challenging Times
Despite the broader market concerns, small investors have the advantage of being able to select specific companies with better prospects or a favorable risk/reward ratio, rather than investing in the market generally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>. Ray Dalio himself has made specific investments that likely account for these macro factors.

### McDonald's (MCD)
Ray Dalio recently invested in McDonald's, listed under the ticker MCD at $180 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:05">[00:06:05]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:09">[00:06:09]</a>. McDonald's is renowned for being more of a real estate business than a fast-food chain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:37">[00:06:37]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:56">[00:07:56]</a>. Its business model involves franchising restaurants and owning the land and buildings where they operate, allowing them to collect substantial rents and royalties from franchisees <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:45">[00:06:45]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:06">[00:07:06]</a>. Over 70% of McDonald's income comes from real estate rents, which are less affected by economic downturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:29">[00:08:29]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:31">[00:08:31]</a>.

This model provides high margins and requires little investment for the company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:56">[00:06:56]</a>. It has shown resilience, performing positively even in 2008 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:14">[00:08:14]</a>. Current growth for McDonald's is primarily from emerging countries with growing middle classes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:03">[00:08:03]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:06">[00:08:06]</a>. Despite the recent crisis, its sales are only estimated to drop by 12% for the current year, with a quick rebound expected <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:55">[00:08:55]</a>. McDonald's is projected to grow its earnings per share by 7-12% annually through new restaurants, price increases, and share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:28">[00:09:28]</a>.

### India Stock Market (via INDA ETF)
Ray Dalio, as a macro investor, also invests in specific investment themes like the economy of certain countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:19">[00:10:19]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:27">[00:10:27]</a>. He recently bought the INDA ETF, which replicates the performance of the Indian stock market, listed at $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. India is considered a "very closed market" to foreign investors, making ETFs an easier way to gain exposure without bureaucratic complications <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:56">[00:10:56]</a>.

India is highlighted as one of the countries with the best economic prospects for the next decade, with impressive growth rates exceeding 7% annually, surpassing China and other major economies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:34">[00:11:34]</a>. Its potential is attributed to a young population, pro-capitalist reforms, cheap labor, low national debt, and proximity to major world powers like China <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>.

### Inditex (ITX)
Inditex, owner of Zara clothing stores, is listed under the ticker ITX at â‚¬24 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:39">[00:12:39]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:49">[00:12:49]</a>. Founded by Amancio Ortega, Inditex is a company with a resilient business model and strong competitive advantages in distribution, design, and business culture <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:08">[00:13:08]</a>. It has successfully adapted to online retail, with over 20% of its sales online <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:17">[00:13:17]</a>.

A key advantage for Inditex, especially during crises, is that it owns most of its retail premises, reducing the pressure of paying rents that can drive other companies to bankruptcy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:37">[00:13:37]</a>. Furthermore, Inditex has no debt, ensuring its long-term viability <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:47">[00:13:47]</a>.

While a mature company, Inditex has significant future growth potential, particularly in less saturated markets like Germany, which has fewer Zara stores despite a larger and wealthier population compared to Spain <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:53">[00:13:53]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:03">[00:14:03]</a>. The company monitors "comparable sales" (same-store sales) to ensure genuine growth, and its comparable sales have been solid and consistent over time <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:45">[00:14:45]</a>. Inditex projects a 4-6% growth in comparable sales, plus growth from new store openings, for an overall growth rate of almost 10% per year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:49">[00:14:49]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:15:50">[00:15:50]</a>.

> [!NOTE] Taking broad market statements with caution
> It is advised to approach broad market statements with caution, as large investors often manage significant sums of money, making the general behavior of the stock market highly impactful on their portfolios <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:14">[00:05:14]</a> <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:21">[00:05:21]</a>. Small investors, however, retain the flexibility to select individual companies with better prospects, thereby mitigating broader market risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:30">[00:05:30]</a>.

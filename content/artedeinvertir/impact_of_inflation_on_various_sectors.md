Warren Buffett has stated that the next crisis is inevitable and has provided new guidance on how to adapt to the current situation of inflation and other associated risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:09">[00:00:09]</a>. He emphasizes that inflation affects everyone, whether investing or not, as money will be devalued if left idle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:53">[00:00:53]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Warning on Inflation
During an annual conference, Warren Buffett noted substantial price increases due to inflation, which are being accepted globally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:09">[00:02:09]</a>. He specifically mentioned that steel prices are rising daily, indicating an overheated economy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>. He has warned that inflation is, and will continue to be, higher than people anticipated <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>.

A second wave of inflation is expected in 2023, driven by wage increases updated with inflation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>. The easiest solution to the problem, according to Buffett, will be the devaluation of the dollar or the euro, as similar situations are occurring in Europe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:32">[00:03:32]</a>. This means holding dollars, euros, or [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | investments]] in liquidity, fixed income, bonds, or bank deposits is very bad news <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:40">[00:03:40]</a>. Governments devalue currency to increase their income through inflation and manage debt levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:51">[00:03:51]</a>.

The dollar has devalued significantly, with Warren Buffett noting a 99% loss of its value in the last 100 years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:22">[00:04:22]</a>. Inflation is described as one of the biggest scams, accepted because the nominal value of money in accounts remains the same, even as its purchasing power diminishes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:22">[00:05:22]</a>.

The COVID-19 lockdowns led to the largest wealth transfer in history, effectively a "gigantic robbery of the middle class" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:14">[00:06:14]</a>. Fiscal stimuli and printed money finance new debt, which the middle class ultimately pays through taxes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:24">[00:06:24]</a>. This money channeled through government recovery plans benefits companies, whose prosperity is reflected in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:08">[00:07:08]</a>. Therefore, only those with productive assets like stock market [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | investments]] will see an increase in their wealth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:55">[00:07:55]</a>.

Warren Buffett stated that all actions have consequences, and printing money cannot be a perpetual solution to crises <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:27">[00:09:27]</a>. The tremendous printing of money has caused the debt levels of the four main global economies to rise from 15 trillion to 25 trillion dollars <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. The only way to protect oneself in this environment is to invest <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:54">[00:10:54]</a>.

## Impact on Specific Sectors and Costs
*   **Wages**: Walmart is offering salaries up to $100,000 for truck drivers due to difficulty finding them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:29">[00:02:29]</a>. Shortages in certain sectors due to recent movements and confinements are translating into higher transportation costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:44">[00:02:44]</a>. Companies see their costs rise, which in turn leads to higher prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:55">[00:02:55]</a>.
*   **Consumer Spending**: Money given to consumers, for example through checks in the US and tax cuts in Europe, ends up being spent on restaurants, travel, leisure, and cars, causing car prices to rise <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:50">[00:08:50]</a>.
*   **Raw Materials**: The price of steel is increasing daily <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:14">[00:02:14]</a>.

## Impact on Investments and Assets
Warren Buffett argues that traditional conservative investments like bank deposits or bonds have a very complicated future <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:02">[00:17:02]</a>.
*   **Bonds vs. Productive Assets**: Buying a 10-year bond today yielding 2% is like paying 50 times earnings for a business that won't grow <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:03">[00:16:03]</a>. In contrast, a company like Visa, trading at 28 times earnings, offers an immediate 3% return and grows profits at over 10%, leading to a total annual profitability greater than 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:30">[00:16:30]</a>.
*   **Gold**: Buffett stated in 2011 that owning an ounce of gold will always be an ounce of gold, but it produces nothing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:20">[00:17:20]</a>. Productive assets like stocks, real estate, or farmland generate dividends or income, leading to better future performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:35">[00:17:35]</a>. Gold's value retention in times of inflation is primarily because it cannot be printed like fiat money <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:40">[00:18:40]</a>.
*   **Stocks**: Disciplined companies that do not over-issue shares can increase their value, benefiting shareholders as the pie to be shared remains the same or even shrinks if shares are bought back <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:19:07">[00:19:07]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Investment Strategy in an Inflationary Environment
Buffett, to protect against inflation, made significant acquisitions, including a $12 billion purchase and another nearly $5 billion investment in HP shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:42">[00:11:42]</a>. He didn't rush to buy raw materials, gold, or energy companies, but rather technology companies with specific characteristics <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:01">[00:12:01]</a>.

He recommends investing in "fabulous businesses" like Google, Apple, and Microsoft <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:33">[00:14:33]</a>. These companies generate "tons of cash flow" and require little capital reinvestment, meaning they can thrive even if inflation doubles the cost of investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:39">[00:14:39]</a>.

### Case Studies
*   **HP**: A large company (40 billion) that has multiplied its performance by 8 times since 1994, outperforming indices with dividends <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:25:39">[00:25:39]</a>. HP generated six billion in cash flow in 2021-2022 but only needed to reinvest 580 million (10% of earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:26:11">[00:26:11]</a>. This low reinvestment makes it resilient to inflation. HP also engages in significant share buybacks, withdrawing 15% of the company's stock in the last two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:27:52">[00:27:52]</a>. This action increases the value per share even if the company grows at 0% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:31:33">[00:31:33]</a>.
    *   HP has two business lines: personal computers (growing 15% last year, 8% margin) and printers/cartridges (in decline, 18% margin) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:29:36">[00:29:36]</a>. The printing part, though declining, is becoming a smaller portion of the company's total business, allowing the growing hardware segment to drive overall growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:30:57">[00:30:57]</a>.
*   **Occidental Petroleum (Oxy)**: Buffett invested in Oxy after listening to their conference call, where they discussed channeling high oil earnings into share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:28:43">[00:28:43]</a>.
*   **Google**: Generates high cash flow (146 billion per year) and reinvests a smaller portion (20-27%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:04">[00:51:04]</a>. It has high profit margins and actively repurchases shares, like a $50 billion buyback last year <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:51:21">[00:51:21]</a>.
*   **Starbucks**: Trades at a lower price after a recent drop <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:40">[00:32:40]</a>. It is a good business that can raise prices and requires little reinvestment (around 20% of earnings) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:32:48">[00:32:48]</a>. The founder's return to the company in 2008 previously led to a significant stock rally after a downturn <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:34:09">[00:34:09]</a>. Even with rising coffee prices, Starbucks' profits were not compressed, as the raw material cost is a small fraction of the final product's price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:35:52">[00:35:52]</a>. It has high EBITDA margins (above 20%) and EBIT margins (above 15%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:37:28">[00:37:28]</a>.
*   **CH Robinson**: A logistics broker that doesn't own trucks or airplanes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:10">[00:40:10]</a>. It connects companies needing transportation with carriers, charging a percentage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:40:22">[00:40:22]</a>. It's well-protected against inflation because if transportation rates rise (due to driver salaries or oil prices), CH Robinson's revenue increases, but its costs (primarily technology and non-unionized worker salaries) do not rise proportionally <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:41:10">[00:41:10]</a>. This means it benefits from price increases without bearing the full burden of rising operational costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:42:31">[00:42:31]</a>. It has very low reinvestment needs (around 10% of cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:47:53">[00:47:53]</a>.
*   **MT (Domino's Pizza, etc.)**: Benefits from inflation because, as a franchisor, it receives royalties based on sales <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:00">[00:59:00]</a>. If franchisees raise menu prices due to inflation, MT's percentage income increases without a proportional rise in its own costs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:10">[00:59:10]</a>. It boasts high profit margins (24% EBITDA) and extremely low reinvestment needs (4% of cash flow in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:59:34">[00:59:34]</a>.
*   **Iberdrola (Utilities)**: While utility companies can raise electricity prices with inflation and maintain profits, they require significant reinvestment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:53:52">[00:53:52]</a>. Iberdrola, for instance, reinvests nearly 70% of its operating profit, making it less attractive than businesses with lower capital intensity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:54:16">[00:54:16]</a>.
*   **Micron (Memory)**: A cyclical business where prices for RAM memories fluctuate significantly <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:48">[01:00:48]</a>. Its revenue and profits can swing wildly, making it challenging to predict future earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:03">[01:01:03]</a>. It also requires substantial reinvestment (10 billion for 12 billion in income in 2021) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:01:50">[01:01:50]</a>.
*   **Darling Ingredients**: A company that manufactures food ingredients, which is generally a good business <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:26">[00:55:26]</a>. It has strong historical growth in earnings per share (16% annually) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:55:49">[00:55:49]</a>.
*   **Robertet (Essences)**: A French company manufacturing essences for perfumes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:26">[00:56:26]</a>. It operates in a market where reputation and long history are key competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:35">[00:56:35]</a>. Its products are critical but low-cost for clients, allowing it to raise prices with inflation while maintaining high profit margins (16% operating profit) and low reinvestment needs (28 million for 114 million cash flow) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:56:51">[00:56:51]</a>.
*   **Teamviewer (Software)**: Provides software for remote work <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:28">[01:07:28]</a>. It's a technology business with high margins and low reinvestment, supported by recurring subscription revenue <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:07:50">[01:07:50]</a>. However, it can be subject to overpayment if its valuation multiple is too high relative to its growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:17">[01:08:17]</a>.
*   **Global Payments (POS terminals)**: Operates in an oligopoly market for credit card POS terminals <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:10:44">[01:10:44]</a>. The control by a few companies creates high barriers to entry, allowing incumbents to prosper and maintain high profit margins <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:53">[01:11:53]</a>.

## General Investment Advice
Buffett advises people to invest in themselves and improve their skills <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:06">[01:06:06]</a>. The best [[impact_of_inflation_on_investments | investment]] one can make is in education to increase skills in any area <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:11">[01:11:11]</a>. This ensures that one's services remain valuable, regardless of currency devaluation <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:00:57">[02:00:57]</a>.

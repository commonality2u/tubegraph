Michael Burry, an investor renowned for predicting the 2008 crisis, gained widespread fame through the movie *The Big Short* <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:10">[00:00:10]</a>. After a period of public absence, he gave an interview in the O Barnes newspaper, issuing a warning about a potential new crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:27">[00:00:27]</a>. Currently, Burry has focused his portfolio on just six stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:32">[00:00:32]</a>, with a net worth of approximately $60 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:24">[00:03:24]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Background and Investment Philosophy

Before his investment prowess became widely known, Michael Burry was a doctor by profession, beginning to combine his medical work with his passion for the stock market in the late 1990s <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:49">[00:00:49]</a>. He actively shared his investment ideas on internet forums and blogs, which garnered attention due to his successful results <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:59">[00:00:59]</a>. This led to him receiving a million dollars to start his investment fund, Scion Capital <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:07">[00:01:07]</a>.

Scion Capital delivered impressive returns from the outset. In its first five years, primarily investing in stocks, the fund generated significant gains, such as an 8% return in its first year while the S&P fell 7%, and a 55% return in the second year when the S&P dropped 11% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:13">[00:01:13]</a>. Within five years, he was managing over $500 million for clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:44">[00:01:44]</a>.

In 2006, as depicted in *The Big Short*, Burry radically shifted his [[michael_burrys_investment_strategy_and_theories | investment style]], betting his entire fund against the impending crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:52">[00:01:52]</a>. Despite initial complications and investor nervousness, his bet paid off handsomely during the 2007-2008 crisis, yielding a 160% return in 2007 alone <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:19">[00:02:19]</a>. This monumental success solidified his legend status, generating over $700 million for his investors and elevating his personal fortune to over $100 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:27">[00:02:27]</a>.

Burry's story is particularly inspiring as he achieved success as an ordinary person without a financial background, contacts, or prior experience in the financial sector, relying solely on effort and dedication <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Current Portfolio: The Six Stocks

Currently, [[analysis_of_individual_stocks_in_michael_burrys_portfolio | Michael Burry's stock portfolio]] is highly concentrated in six specific companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:20">[00:03:20]</a>.

### 1. Gamestop
*   **Weighting:** 28% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:47">[00:03:47]</a>
*   **Description:** Gamestop is a leading company in video game and entertainment product sales in the United States <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:50">[00:03:50]</a>.
*   **Current Situation:** Its shares have faced challenges, falling from $45 to $5, primarily due to the shift from physical stores to online channels for video game and entertainment purchases <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:57">[00:03:57]</a>.
*   **Burry's Involvement:** Michael Burry is an active shareholder, proposing significant management changes to benefit shareholders and potentially regularize Gamestop shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:13">[00:04:13]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** This is considered a "daring investment" with inherent risk, but if the company resolves its online sales issues, the shares could see significant long-term performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:27">[00:04:27]</a>. It aligns with Burry's preference for contrarian bets on ignored companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:40">[00:09:40]</a>.

### 2. Tailored Brands
*   **Weighting:** 22% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:52">[00:04:52]</a>
*   **Description:** Tailored Brands specializes in men's fashion and accessories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:55">[00:04:55]</a>.
*   **Current Situation:** After strong growth in the 2000s, the company has stagnated in recent years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:59">[00:04:59]</a>. The shares are trading at historical lows and have an attractive P/E ratio of five times next year's earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:09">[00:05:09]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** Burry's investment again shows a preference for the retail sector and undervalued shares <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:04">[00:05:04]</a>.

### 3. Google (Alphabet Inc.)
*   **Weighting:** 16% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:18">[00:05:18]</a>
*   **Description:** Google (Alphabet Inc.) is characterized as a high-quality company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:20">[00:05:20]</a>.
*   **Current Situation:** Burry likes to mix "contrarian" stocks with high-quality companies trading at reasonable prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:24">[00:05:24]</a>. Google fits this description, being a high-quality company at an attractive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:41">[00:05:41]</a>. When the video was made, Google was trading at $1,300, having previously been at $1,100 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:05:52">[00:05:52]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** This investment reflects Burry's willingness to include established, strong companies with competitive advantages and high returns on capital in his portfolio, especially when they are offered at good prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:05">[00:11:05]</a>.

### 4. Portman Warehouse
*   **Weighting:** 14% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:02">[00:06:02]</a>
*   **Description:** Portman Warehouse is a retail company selling items related to outdoor sports, including products for climbing, camping, hunting, and firearms <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:07">[00:06:07]</a>.
*   **Current Situation:** The company is experiencing solid growth, mainly driven by the performance of the outdoor sports niche market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:20">[00:06:20]</a>. Michael Burry is estimated to have invested around $4 per share, with the stock currently trading at $8 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:26">[00:06:26]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** Despite the share increase, it remains in his portfolio due to its attractive valuation of only 12 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:36">[00:06:36]</a>.

### 5. Bed Bath & Beyond
*   **Weighting:** 13% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:42">[00:06:42]</a>
*   **Description:** This company sells household items <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:47">[00:06:47]</a>.
*   **Current Situation:** It's another retail company in a currently unfashionable sector, heavily impacted in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:51">[00:06:51]</a>. The main threat comes from online sales companies like Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:03">[00:07:03]</a>. The shares are offered at a very attractive price of seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:13">[00:07:13]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** This investment aligns with Burry's preference for companies that are "very beaten down" but offer attractive valuations, despite certain risks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:06:55">[00:06:55]</a>.

### 6. Canadian Natural Resources
*   **Weighting:** 8% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>
*   **Description:** Canadian Natural Resources is Canada's largest oil producer, with a production of one million barrels per day and a market capitalization exceeding $35 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:28">[00:07:28]</a>. The company is a pioneer in oil sands technology, an innovative process to extract oil from sand through a mining and chemical process <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:40">[00:07:40]</a>.
*   **Current Situation:** The company's pioneering efforts in oil sands and other assets led its stock to rise quickly from $4 to $30 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:30">[00:08:30]</a>. It is considered one of the most solid raw materials companies, having increased its dividend for 19 consecutive years, yielding 4% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:43">[00:08:43]</a>.
*   **Rationale:** Despite negativity surrounding the energy sector, the market offers these shares at a very attractive valuation of only seven times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:08:54">[00:08:54]</a>. This represents another contrarian position for Burry, who seeks out undervalued sectors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>.

## Key Investment Principles Guiding His Portfolio

[[michael_burrys_investment_strategies_and_advice_for_stock_market_success | Michael Burry's investment strategies]] are rooted in principles he shared during his early years on forums and blogs. These principles shed light on his current portfolio composition:

### Principle 1: Seek Ignored and Undervalued Companies
> "My investment strategy is not very complex. I try to buy shares in ignored companies when it seems that they are going to go bankrupt and I sell them when they have improved slightly. The management of my portfolio is so important like company selection if I can do both well I will be successful" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:38">[00:09:38]</a>.

This principle explains his strong preference for the retail and energy sectors within his current portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:56">[00:09:56]</a>. These are currently unfashionable sectors where undervalued companies are abundant, offering significant potential for regularization if market fears subside <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:05">[00:10:05]</a>.

### Principle 2: Maintain a Concentrated Portfolio
> "I like to have between 12 and 18 stocks in my portfolio...this number of positions I feel it gives me room to have my best ideas while smoothing out volatility so as not to confuse portfolio volatility with portfolio risk and he adds ironically you know i have this problem at heart and i don't want to have extra stress" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:16">[00:10:16]</a>.

While Burry states a range of 12-18 stocks, his current portfolio of six stocks is even more concentrated. Anything under 25 stocks is considered a concentrated portfolio, a strategy also favored by other great investors like [[warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] and Peter Lynch, who prefer to concentrate their investments in their highest-conviction ideas <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:43">[00:10:43]</a>.

### Principle 3: Acquire Quality Companies at Good Prices
> "I'm also delighted to add to the portfolio the companies that [[warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] likes with a competitive advantage, high return on capital if the market offers them at good prices" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>.

This explains his investment in Google, a classic example of a high-quality company with a competitive advantage that [[warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] would appreciate, trading at an attractive price <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:15">[00:11:15]</a>. This highlights Burry's flexibility as an investor; he is willing to invest in both contrarian, overlooked ideas and more popular, high-quality companies when they are reasonably priced <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:24">[00:11:24]</a>.

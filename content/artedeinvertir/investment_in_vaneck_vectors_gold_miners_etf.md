David Einhorn's Greenlight Capital has recently shown optimism for the future by investing in the VanEck Gold Miners ETF (GDX), which is listed in the USA under the ticker GDX at a price of $40 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:36:36">[00:36:36]</a>. In the last quarter, Einhorn's fund purchased over $67 million in shares of this ETF, aiming to benefit from a potential rise in [[investment_opportunities_in_gold_and_energy_sectors | gold]] prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:50:37">[00:50:37]</a>. This represents a high percentage of their portfolio dedicated to this [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]]-related ETF <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:12">[01:12:12]</a>.

## Reasons for Investment

Einhorn's decision to invest significantly in the GDX ETF is detailed in his latest letter to investors. He notes that both Democratic and Republican parties share a tendency to print money, with over $3.3 trillion printed in the current year alone, accounting for 22% of all dollars in circulation in 2019 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:11:00">[01:11:00]</a>.

This extensive money printing is expected to directly influence the behavior of [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]] in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. Central banks' actions are anticipated to generate inflation, which is seen as highly positive for [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]]'s performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:54">[01:00:54]</a>. As expected, [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]] is performing well, even attracting investors who had been critical of it for decades <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:58:39">[00:58:39]</a>.

## Performance and Valuation

The [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]] ETF has appreciated over 50% in the last 12 months, largely due to the vast amounts of money being printed globally to combat the current crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:35">[01:08:35]</a>.

Valuing this type of [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]] ETF is more complex than valuing a typical stock, as these are considered speculative instruments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:12:35">[01:12:35]</a>. However, it is clear that if central governments continue to print money, inflation will tend to rise, which bodes well for [[gold_royalties_and_investments | gold]]'s performance in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:52">[01:15:52]</a>.

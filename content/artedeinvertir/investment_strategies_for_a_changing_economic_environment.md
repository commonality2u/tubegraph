The current economic landscape is characterized by significant shifts, prompting prominent investors to adjust their portfolios and offer warnings about future conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:23">[00:00:23]</a>. This period demands a rethinking of traditional [[investment_strategies_in_an_economic_downturn | investment strategies]], especially given the end of "easy money" policies, rising inflation, and geopolitical tensions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:56">[00:02:56]</a>.

## Ray Dalio's Warnings and Portfolio Adjustments

Ray Dalio, renowned as the manager of the world's largest investment fund, is closely watched by the market due to his accurate predictions, notably the 2008 financial crisis <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:45">[01:30:45]</a>. He has successfully navigated numerous market crises over the past 20-30 years with minimal losses and consistent returns during market upturns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:52:05">[01:52:05]</a>.

Dalio has issued a warning about a "new world order," highlighting:
*   **Political Polarization**: Tremendous political polarization in the United States between Republicans and Democrats, even suggesting a risk of civil war <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:09">[02:21:09]</a>.
*   **Shift in World Power**: The center of global power is rotating from the United States to China, potentially causing future friction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:34:00">[02:34:00]</a>. This shift could even lead to the dollar ceasing to be the world's reserve currency <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:48:00">[02:48:00]</a>.
*   **End of Easy Money**: Central banks, like the Federal Reserve, are changing their "easy money" policies, moving away from low interest rates and money printing <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:56:00">[02:56:00]</a>. This policy change will have serious consequences in the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:06:00">[03:06:00]</a>.
*   **Market "Madness"**: Dalio has commented on the "madness" seen in the crypto world and certain technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:11:00">[03:11:00]</a>.

He anticipates periods of high inflation and much more difficult financial conditions <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:30:00">[03:30:00]</a>. Interest rates in the U.S. are expected to rise significantly, with forecasts of 1% by July, implying four rate hikes from the current near-zero levels <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:03:00">[04:03:00]</a>. Recent inflation data showing the highest levels in 40 years supports an accelerated series of rate hikes <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:46:00">[04:46:00]</a>.

In response, Dalio has made significant portfolio adjustments:
*   He has sold 90% of his shares and reduced weight in nearly 300 others <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:19:00">[07:19:00]</a>.
*   He sold most shares from emerging countries, as these and technology stocks tend to correct more during volatility <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="07:34:00">[07:34:00]</a>.
*   His purchases have been in defensive shares like Procter & Gamble, Costco, and Pepsi, which tend to perform better during market corrections <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:04:00">[08:04:00]</a>.

Dalio warns that average returns in the markets could be as low as 3-4% in the future, compared to 8-10% in the past, and these lower returns will come with a much higher level of risk <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:06:00">[05:06:00]</a>. He predicts the world could change "quite alarmingly" in the next five years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="05:44:00">[05:44:00]</a>.

## Market Realities and Overvaluation

The "Fed's put" (the Federal Reserve intervening to support the market) is not expected until the S&P 500 sees falls of 15-20% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:14:00">[06:14:00]</a>. This implies that further market corrections are seen as "healthy" to adjust overvaluation, especially in areas like technology stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>. The Nasdaq and small-cap indices like the Russell 2000 have already corrected significantly (around 20%) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:46:00">[06:46:00]</a>.

Many previously popular companies, especially those trading at very demanding multiples, have experienced severe drops of 50-80% from their highs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:23:00">[09:23:00]</a>. This new dose of reality from central banks means that holding expensive shares carries "enormous risk" in the current economic scenario <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:31:00">[10:31:00]</a>.

### Lessons from Mark Leonard
Mark Leonard, CEO of Constellation Software, a highly successful technology holding company, offers valuable [[investment_strategies_for_uncertain_times | investment strategies]] for technology investing. He advises that good technology businesses should "never trade above five times their sales" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:30:00">[13:30:00]</a>, and considers multiples below two times sales a good investment if the company is good and has growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="13:50:00">[13:50:00]</a>. Many popular tech stocks, even after significant drops, still trade above these recommended multiples <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="14:10:00">[14:10:00]</a>.

## Warren Buffett's Portfolio and Independent Thinking

Warren Buffett's recent purchase of Activision Blizzard shares has drawn accusations of insider trading due to his friendship with Bill Gates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="16:11:00">[16:11:00]</a>. However, Buffett has stated he never invested in Microsoft due to his friendship with Gates to avoid misunderstandings, despite Microsoft's immense growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="19:26:00">[19:26:00]</a>. Furthermore, Bill Gates is no longer on the board of directors of Microsoft or Berkshire Hathaway, making him an external shareholder <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="21:52:00">[21:52:00]</a>.

Buffett's smaller operations (under $2.5 billion) are handled by his sub-managers, Ted Weschler and Todd Combs <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>. The Activision purchase likely falls under their purview <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:24:00">[20:24:00]</a>. Additionally, Berkshire Hathaway has held Activision in the past, and its business model (franchise-based like Hasbro or Mattel) falls within Buffett's "circle of competence" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="20:43:00">[20:43:00]</a>. This situation underscores the importance of independent thinking and verifying facts, rather than relying on speculation or conspiracy theories <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="22:36:00">[22:36:00]</a>.

## Michael Burry's Defensive Buys

Michael Burry, known for "The Big Short," has recently bought interesting defensive shares:
*   **General Dynamics**: A military equipment manufacturer with significant competitive advantages, producing complex items like nuclear submarines with virtually no competition <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:31:00">[25:31:00]</a>. Its demand is non-cyclical, dependent on defense budgets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="25:59:00">[25:59:00]</a>. It's considered a defensive stock that typically performs well when the market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="27:24:00">[27:24:00]</a>.
*   **Fidelity National Financial**: A leader in mortgage title insurance in the U.S., a very lucrative niche <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="28:49:00">[28:49:00]</a>. With increasing home sales, the company is performing well, and its valuation is at historic lows (around 8 times earnings, compared to a 10-year average of 14-15 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:05:00">[30:05:00]</a>.

## Bill Miller's Value Plays

Bill Miller, known for beating the S&P 500 for nearly 20 consecutive years, is a legendary investor <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="30:49:00">[30:49:00]</a>. He has had success with investments in Bitcoin and Amazon <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="31:28:00">[31:28:00]</a>. He has added positions in **XC Technology**, a company that has suffered significantly in the stock market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="32:10:00">[32:10:00]</a>. While its business has deteriorated and growth is stagnant, its current valuation is very low (around 8 times earnings compared to rivals at 18 times) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:01:00">[33:01:00]</a>. Miller's investment suggests a belief that the company's decline may have bottomed out and simply maintaining or slightly growing its business could lead to good returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="33:27:00">[33:33:27]</a>.

## Highly Concentrated Portfolios and Specific Stocks

Some funds employ a highly concentrated portfolio strategy, focusing on exceptionally good businesses with huge competitive advantages <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:20:00">[34:20:00]</a>. Examples include Google, Microsoft, Visa, Mastercard, and Moody's <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="34:33:00">[34:33:00]</a>.

*   **Visa and Mastercard**: These companies operate in an unregulated oligopoly and are considered strong holdings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:52:00">[35:52:00]</a>. Despite recent falls due to temporary fears (like alliances with Amazon or "buy now, pay later" trends), their fundamentals remain strong <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="35:17:00">[35:17:00]</a>. Mastercard's latest results showed profits growing over 40%, and they expect annualized profit growth of 20-23% for the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="37:06:00">[37:06:00]</a>. Their valuation at around 31 times earnings after the drop is closer to their historical average with normalized interest rates <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="38:03:00">[38:03:00]</a>.

### True Value's Investment Approach

The speaker's firm, True Value, focuses on investing in stocks with an intrinsic value below their market price, expecting that value to increase <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:17:00">[44:17:00]</a>. They view market volatility as an opportunity to acquire undervalued assets <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="40:48:00">[40:48:00]</a>.

Examples from True Value's portfolio and analysis:
*   **Humana**: Published strong results and has maintained good performance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="44:30:00">[44:30:00]</a>.
*   **Go (Alphabet)**: Despite good results and increased future profit expectations, the stock has fallen due to the bear market environment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="45:06:00">[45:06:00]</a>. The company is actively repurchasing shares, indicating management believes the stock is undervalued <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="48:08:00">[48:08:08]</a>.
*   **MT Group**: A defensive business with good growth prospects, trading at a reasonable valuation of around 10 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:20:00">[50:20:00]</a>. It is recovering from the pandemic's impact on the restaurant sector, especially in Canada where restrictions were severe <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="50:48:00">[50:48:00]</a>. The company is resuming acquisitions and the current valuation is historically low outside of the 2020 confinement period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="54:35:00">[54:35:00]</a>.
*   **Facebook (Meta Platforms)**: Has dropped to historically low valuation levels (around 13-14 times earnings excluding cash) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="56:36:00">[56:36:00]</a>. While the online advertising industry continues to grow, the market is currently focusing on negatives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="58:51:00">[58:51:00]</a>.
*   **Dababy (Real Estate)**: A Nordic real estate company whose stock has fallen due to concerns about rising interest rates affecting property valuations <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:16:38">[01:16:38]</a>. However, it benefits from inflation, as real estate is a strong inflation hedge, revaluing the portfolio <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:18:11">[01:18:11]</a>. The company also pays negative interest rates on some bonds <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:15:34">[01:15:34]</a>. Dababy trades at around one time book value, while companies with its return on equity should trade at three times book value according to Warren Buffett <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:26:04">[01:26:04]</a>.

## General Investment Principles in Volatile Environments

*   **Independent Thinking**: It is crucial to have independent thinking and verify all information for oneself, rather than blindly following others or media narratives <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:08:06">[01:08:06]</a>.
*   **Volatility as Opportunity**: Market volatility and downturns, while uncomfortable, create opportunities for significant returns in the long term <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:39">[01:00:39]</a>. This is when truly "exceptional investors" make money by taking advantage of fear and short-termism <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:06">[01:00:06]</a>.
*   **Optimizing Entry Points**: Learning to analyze trading volumes during sharp drops (like in PayPal or Facebook) can help optimize entry points, as large institutional selling often normalizes after initial panic <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:31:59">[01:31:59]</a>.
*   **Valuation vs. Price**: Do not confuse a stock's price with its intrinsic value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:58">[01:49:58]</a>. A company can be cheap but continue to fall in the short term, but if the fundamentals remain strong, the market should eventually recognize its value <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:00:00">[01:00:00]</a>.

In an environment of negative real interest rates (interest rate minus inflation), financial and real estate investments tend to perform well, as borrowed money can be invested in productive assets yielding higher returns <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>. This could potentially lead to massive stock market rallies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:24:46">[01:24:46]</a>. Investors should prioritize learning to value shares and make informed decisions, rather than being "stock market tourists" who only suffer losses <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:59:51">[01:59:51]</a>.

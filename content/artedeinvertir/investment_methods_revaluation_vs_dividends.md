Many people wonder if it's possible to live off the stock market and achieve a predictable, increasing income over time. The answer is yes, with certain nuances [00:00:01].

## Two Ways to Make Money from Stocks

There are two primary ways to generate income from stocks in the stock market [00:00:14]:

### 1. Revaluation (Capital Gains)
The first and most common method is revaluation, which involves buying a stock to sell it later at a higher price [00:00:46].
*   **Mechanism**: This method relies on other investors being willing to pay more for your stocks in the future [00:00:55].
*   **Predictability**: It provides less predictable and more volatile results [00:01:02]. While some stocks may be recognized for their value quickly (e.g., six months), others might take two or three years [00:01:06]. This method is a component of future [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | revaluation]] but needs to be viewed in the longer term [00:03:22].

### 2. Dividends
The second way to generate income is through dividends, which offers a much more predictable approach [00:01:11].
*   **Mechanism**: Certain companies periodically distribute a portion of their profits to their shareholders [00:01:17].
*   **Independence**: With dividends, investors do not depend on other future investors being willing to pay more for their shares [00:01:26]. The focus shifts to analyzing the company's ability to generate profits and distribute stable and growing dividends over time [00:01:34].
*   **Predictability**: This method results in more predictable income [00:01:42].
*   **Company Reinvestment**: Companies typically do not distribute 100% of their profits as dividends; a portion is reinvested in the business to facilitate future growth [00:03:10]. This reinvestment can lead to a component of future [[valuation_of_companies_and_investment_strategies | revaluation]] [00:03:22].

## Building a Dividend-Focused Portfolio

To achieve a consistent profitability objective, such as $100 or €100 per day (equivalent to $3,000 per month or $36,000 per year) [00:01:46], specific [[stock_investment_advice | investment strategies]] are recommended:

*   **Diversification**: Academic studies suggest investing in at least six different sectors [00:02:24]. It is advisable for a portfolio to contain between 15 and 20 shares that meet profitability objectives [00:02:35]. A well-diversified portfolio helps balance performance, as some shares may raise dividends while others may reduce them [00:02:42].
*   **Focus on Company Fundamentals**: For this [[stock_investment_advice | investment philosophy]], the focus should be on the company's capacity to generate profits and pay high dividends, rather than solely on the stock market price [00:02:52].
*   **Realistic Dividend Yield Objective**: A realistic annual dividend yield target is between 6% and 8% [00:05:51]. While some companies offer lower, safer yields (3-4%, requiring more capital) or higher yields (10-12%, often unstable), an average portfolio yield of around 7% is ideal [00:06:00].

## Calculating Required Investment Capital

To determine the capital needed to achieve a specific annual income (e.g., $36,000), use the following formula [00:06:39]:
*   Divide 1 by the expected portfolio profitability (e.g., 7% or 0.07), then multiply by 100. This gives a multiplier (e.g., 1 / 0.07 * 100 = 14.28, rounded to 14 times) [00:06:42].
*   Multiply the annual income goal by this multiplier. For a $36,000 annual goal with a 7% yield, approximately $504,000 would be needed ($36,000 x 14) [00:06:56].
*   The required capital is inversely related to the portfolio's profitability and directly related to the average daily performance expectation [00:07:20]. For example, a $50 daily target would require about $250,000 [00:07:37].

## Finding High-Dividend Stocks

Several [[utilizing_tools_for_finding_highdividend_stocks | free tools]] can help identify stocks meeting specific dividend criteria [00:02:09].
*   **Investing.com Stock Screener**:
    *   Select "Stock Screener" in the tools section [00:03:59].
    *   Filter dividend yield between 6% and 10% [00:04:10]. Dividends above 10% are often unsustainable, and below 6% might require significantly more capital to reach income goals [00:04:16].
    *   Add a second filter for historical dividend growth: limit the low range to 0% (avoiding companies that reduced dividends) and the top range to 10% average annual growth (as aggressive growth with high yield is rare) [00:04:26].
    *   This screener can be applied to different regions (e.g., Spain, Europe, Latin America, Canada) [00:05:13].
*   **Seeking Alpha (Si Kim Alfa Dot Com)**: Useful for researching dividend stocks, specifically in the "dividends" section under "growth" to see historical dividend growth rates [00:09:04].
*   **MarketScreener**: In the finance section, it shows expected dividend payments for the next two years, allowing monitoring for stability or growth [00:09:23].
    *   When evaluating companies like Real Estate Investment Trusts (REITs) (e.g., National Health Investors), the "Funds From Operations" (FFO) metric is crucial for understanding the company's real capacity to generate profits and pay dividends, rather than just accounting profit [00:16:43].

## Dividend Collection and Taxation

*   **Collection**: Companies automatically send dividend money to your broker account [00:07:50]. Dividends are typically paid monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, or annually [00:07:57].
*   **Taxation**: In most countries, dividends are taxed between 20% and 25% [00:17:23]. A common issue is "withholding tax" or "double taxation" when receiving dividends from outside your country of tax residence [00:17:31].
*   **Reducing Double Taxation**: In the United States, the W8BN form, often easily filled out through brokers like Interactive Brokers, helps avoid this double taxation, ensuring dividends received in your account do not incur that capital loss [00:17:47]. This is part of [[understanding_and_managing_dividendrelated_taxes | understanding and managing dividend-related taxes]].

He is considered a legend on Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:58">[00:00:58]</a>.

### Background and Appaloosa Management
Tepper began his career at Goldman Sachs, where he built relationships that helped him secure the initial capital to found his capital management company, Appaloosa Management <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:02">[00:01:02]</a>. Through tremendous success in managing money for clients, he amassed a fortune of $12 billion <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:10">[00:01:10]</a>. In 2019, he returned all client capital to focus solely on his own investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:16">[00:01:16]</a>.

### Investment Track Record and Philosophy
Over 30 years of managing client money, Tepper achieved an impressive track record that surpasses even that of [[investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]] during the same period <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:22">[00:01:22]</a>. He generated an annual return of 25% for his clients <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:28">[00:01:28]</a>, meaning an initial investment of $10,000 would have grown to over $1.5 million <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:33">[00:01:33]</a>.

Tepper has earned a reputation as one of the "bravest printers" on Wall Street <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:39">[00:01:39]</a>. Similar to [[investment_strategies_of_famous_investors_like_ray_dalio_and_warren_buffett | Warren Buffett]], he is among the first to buy stocks during times of market panic when other investors are hesitant <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:42">[00:01:42]</a>. His best years have consistently followed these periods of market panic, as he is able to invest at the most attractive prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:10">[00:02:10]</a>. He publicly recommended investing in years like 2001, 2009, and 2012 <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:01:58">[00:01:58]</a>.

### Recent Market Commentary and Strategy
In a recent telephone interview with CNBC, Tepper shared his perspective on market conditions:
> The market could fall another 10 or 15 percent if investors panic with the current problem and with the economic consequences. <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:35">[00:02:35]</a>
He added that if the U.S. Congress approved a package of measures, it could signal the end of market falls <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:02:45">[00:02:45]</a>.

The economic measures Tepper referred to were approved two days later, on Friday, March 27th <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:09">[00:03:09]</a>.

When asked if he was buying shares, Tepper emphasized the importance of selective investment:
> What he wants to tell us is that we should not invest in any share no matter how much we see that it has gone down or that the market is offering it at an attractive price what he wants us to understand is that we have to invest in good companies since those weaker companies that are in debt surely will not be able to get through the economic period that is coming <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:30">[00:03:30]</a>
He concluded that companies with a solid competitive position and low debt would emerge stronger, increasing their market share and profits <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:46">[00:03:46]</a>. He expressed confidence that some companies would be worth significantly more in one to two years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:56">[00:03:56]</a>.

These companies meet his criteria of having a strong competitive position and low debt, ensuring their survival and future growth <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:04:40">[00:04:40]</a>. United Healthcare was identified as one of his favored healthcare stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:45">[00:10:45]</a>.

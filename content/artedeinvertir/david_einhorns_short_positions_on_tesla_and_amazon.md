[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]], a highly respected investor known for his average annual returns exceeding 15% per year, gained fame for accurately predicting the fall of Lehman Brothers several months in advance [00:00:07]. He has amassed a personal wealth of over a billion dollars since founding his first investment fund, Greenlight Capital, in 1996 with just $800,000 [00:01:03]. [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] is an "activist investor" who invests for the long term in undervalued stocks and simultaneously invests against (short sells) stocks he believes are overvalued or have poor prospects [00:02:00]. This strategy aims to produce satisfactory results in any market environment, as bearish investments can support the portfolio during downturns [00:02:14].

In a recent letter to his investors, [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] determined an exact date for the end of the current market bubble and explained how he plans to profit from it by focusing his bearish bets on popular stocks such as [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] and Amazon [00:00:24].

## Market Bubble Prediction and Strategy

[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] has made a rare specific prediction regarding the stock market, stating that "September 2nd, 2020 marked the market ceiling and that the bubble has already begun to deflate" [00:04:30]. He notes that investor sentiment is shifting from greed to complacency [00:04:37]. His portfolio has been adjusted by adding short positions in many "low quality stocks that are trading at very high valuations" [00:04:42].

Historically, on September 2nd, the NASDAQ index, which [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] considers overvalued, reached highs of 12,500 and has not touched that level again since [00:05:03].

### Symptoms of the Current Bubble
[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] identifies several symptoms indicating the presence of a large technological bubble:
*   **High Number of IPOs** The high number of Initial Public Offerings (IPOs) is correlated with changes in the market cycle, with new technology companies often seeing revaluations of over 200% on their first day [00:05:37].
*   **Listing of Unprofitable Companies** An impressive 80% of companies currently listed on the stock market are not making profits, surpassing the record from the dot-com bubble in 2000 [00:05:58].
*   **High Degree of Speculation** The market shows a high degree of speculation, exemplified by Hertz, a car rental company that went bankrupt but saw its shares propelled by investors from $1 to $5 [00:06:15]. Even after bankruptcy, the American regulator (SEC) had to intervene to prevent the company from selling worthless shares [00:06:49]. Post-bankruptcy, the number of investors holding Hertz shares tripled from 40,000 to over 140,000 [00:07:20].
*   **Abnormal Stock Performance Post-Split** Popular shares show great performance immediately after announcing a split, despite splits being neutral events for investor value [00:07:36]. Examples include [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] shares revaluing over 50% and Apple shares over 30% after their splits [00:08:00].

## Specific Short Positions

### Amazon
[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | David Einhorn]] has invested against Amazon, listed under the ticker AMZN at $3,200 per share [00:08:36]. While acknowledging Amazon as a great company, he believes its current stock market valuation is excessive due to its recent significant rise [00:08:49].

Amazon's sales have grown by 37%, and its operating cash flow has increased by over 56%, demonstrating "operating leverage" which allows profit to grow faster than sales [00:09:01]. Historically, Amazon's average valuation over the last five years, using the EV/EBITDA ratio, is around 26 times [00:09:27]. It is estimated that Amazon could earn over $54 billion in EBITDA in 2020, potentially growing to over $100 billion in the next three years [00:09:40]. Valued at its historical average, this would suggest a price of $5,200, which is higher than its current $3,200 but lower than the $1,700 it was trading at a year prior [00:09:51].

### [[analysis_of_teslas_stock_and_bearish_bets | Tesla]]
[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] has also invested against [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]], listed under the ticker TSLA at $420 per share, aiming to benefit from a potential stock market drop [00:12:44].

There has been an "epic battle" between [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] and Elon Musk [00:12:57]. Musk has publicly ridiculed [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] as [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]]'s stock continued to rise, causing losses for Greenlight Capital due to its bearish position [00:13:03]. Conversely, [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] has publicly accused [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] of manipulating its accounts to artificially inflate profits and playing with investor expectations [00:13:16]. In a Q2 2020 letter to investors, [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] stated that "On Mars participated in one of the most alarming manipulation scandals in recent history. In response, the SEC fined it an insignificant amount of money" [00:13:34].

[[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]] further explains that [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] is artificially increasing its income through sales of "cars that do not exist" and by leveraging future tax credits to boost currently reported profits [00:13:50].

#### [[analysis_of_teslas_stock_and_bearish_bets | Tesla's]] Valuation Concerns
From a valuation perspective, [[tesla_and_its_market_challenges | Tesla]] is expected to have earnings per share of $3 for 2021 [00:14:12]. At its current trading price, this represents a valuation of over 140 times earnings [00:14:17]. [[david_einhorns_investment_strategies_and_predictions | Einhorn]]'s experience over the past five years highlights the danger of investing against a stock, even if it appears overvalued [00:14:45].

Successful [[identifying_good_investment_opportunities | investment opportunities]] can be found by focusing on specific types of companies and applying diligent research, as demonstrated by historical examples from [[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Warren Buffett]] and other investors.

## Warren Buffett's Early Investment Philosophy

[[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Warren Buffett]] stated in 1999 that with a small amount of money (less than a million dollars), he believed he could achieve annual returns of up to 50% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:08">[00:00:08]</a>. He emphasized that having little money to invest is a significant structural advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:00:19">[00:00:19]</a>.

Buffett's returns have decreased over the years from 50% to around 10% annually due to the massive assets he manages (currently over $80 billion) <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:06:00">[01:06:00]</a>. He noted that if he were working with a small sum, he would "do things completely different" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:21:00">[01:21:00]</a>. With small capital, the investment universe expands to "thousands of possibilities," whereas with $100 trillion, alternatives are scarce <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:30:00">[01:30:00]</a>.

To find these opportunities, one must "move a lot of rocks" and "look for companies that are off the map, very off the map" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:38:00">[01:38:00]</a>. These are often small, local companies that are doing well but are ignored by the broader market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:45:00">[01:45:00]</a>.

### Western Insurance Example

[[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Warren Buffett]] cited Western Insurance as an example of such an opportunity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:49:00">[01:49:00]</a>. The company was trading at $3 per share while earning $20 per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:50:00">[01:50:00]</a>. He aimed to buy as much as possible <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:55:00">[01:55:00]</a>. These types of opportunities are not widely known and require active searching <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="01:58:00">[01:58:00]</a>.

## Investing in Small Companies (Small Caps)

Successful [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | investment strategies]] for high returns involve focusing on small companies, also known as small caps <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:21:00">[02:21:00]</a>. Out of over 30,000 companies listed in the US, only about 500 are in the S&P 500 index <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:24:00">[02:24:00]</a>. These larger, well-analyzed companies rarely yield annual returns above 15% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:37:00">[02:37:00]</a>. However, the other 29,500 companies offer a higher probability of finding undervalued "local businesses" that are not globalized or international <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="02:43:00">[02:43:00]</a>.

### Humanae (True Fund)

An example from the "True fund" illustrates this approach:
*   **Context:** The fund managed only 9 million euros at the time of the investment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:05:00">[03:05:00]</a>.
*   **Company Profile:** Humanae was a micro-company with a market capitalization of barely 30 million euros. It was not followed by analysts and was "off the radar" of many investors <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:14:00">[03:14:00]</a>. It was a good business with little debt and was simply ignored by the market <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:22:00">[03:22:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** Humanae was trading at 1.50 euros per share, with projected earnings of 1 euro per share for the following year, resulting in a P/E ratio of less than two times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:31:00">[03:31:00]</a>.
*   **Action:** Following [[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Warren Buffett]]'s advice for such investments, the fund bought as much as possible daily for four months, accumulating a position of approximately 1 million euros at 1.50 euros per share <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="03:47:00">[03:47:00]</a>.
*   **Result:** Three years later, those shares were trading at 6 euros per share, multiplying the purchase price by four times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="04:01:00">[04:01:00]</a>. This success was attributed to being prepared and knowing the sector, as well as taking time to find opportunities in smaller, lesser-known companies <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="06:37:00">[06:37:00]</a>.

## Focus on Undervalued Investments

Generating "extraordinary returns" requires focusing on investments that are "very, very cheap" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:55:00">[08:55:00]</a>. A stock trading at $10 and earning $1 per share (P/E of 10) might yield around 10% <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:23:00">[08:23:00]</a>. However, finding a stock earning $1 per share but trading at $2 (P/E of 2) could theoretically yield 50% annually <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="08:34:00">[08:34:00]</a>.

### Korean Stocks (Deja Flor) Example

Around 2004, a friend gave [[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Warren Buffett]] a book on Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:00:00">[09:00:00]</a>. He spent five or six hours scanning the book for cheap stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:09:00">[09:09:00]</a>. Finding interesting opportunities, he invested $100 million divided across 20 of those Korean stocks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:16:00">[09:16:00]</a>.

One such stock was Deja Flor, which sold 25% of all flour in South Korea <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:26:00">[09:26:00]</a>.
*   **Earnings:** Its earnings per share in recent years were 2,800, 18,000, and 23,800 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:34:00">[09:34:00]</a>.
*   **Assets:** It also had 100,000 won per share in investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:42:00">[09:42:00]</a>.
*   **Valuation:** The stock was trading at 38,000 won <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:45:00">[09:45:00]</a>.
*   **Result:** [[key_investments_and_strategies_by_top_investors_like_warren_buffett_and_bill_ackman | Buffett]] made a significant return, as the stock quickly appreciated from 38,000 Korean won to almost 240,000 Korean won, multiplying his [[stock_market_investments_and_strategies | investment]] by six times <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="09:57:00">[09:57:00]</a>.

## Enduring Opportunities

These types of opportunities have always existed in markets and will continue to exist in the future because of how markets and the [[stock_market_investments and strategies | stock market]] function <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:10:00">[10:10:00]</a>. Success requires illusion, passion, curiosity, hard work, and a willingness to "do things differently than the rest of the investors" <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="10:25:00">[10:25:00]</a>.

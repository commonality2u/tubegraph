Caterpillar is the fifth-largest holding in Bill Gates' investment portfolio, representing 4.3% of its total weight <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:20">[00:09:20]</a>. Bill Gates has held Caterpillar as a significant position in his portfolio, and its performance has been positive for investors who followed his strategy <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:02">[00:12:02]</a>.

## Business Overview and Market Leadership

Caterpillar is a major industrial machinery company <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:26">[00:09:26]</a>. It is the leading company in terms of market share for the types of machinery it produces <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:58">[00:10:58]</a>. Its main competitors include Komatsu, Hitachi, Volvo, and occasionally [[john_deere_and_agricultural_machinery_investment | John Deere]] in categories where their businesses overlap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:03">[00:11:03]</a>. Caterpillar is recognized as the best brand in its sector <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:18">[00:11:18]</a>, with a strong quality-price ratio, reliability, and robust technological capacity <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:03:00">[00:03:00]</a>. The company aims to provide equipment that is more reliable and durable than rivals, supported by a larger network of distributors for maintenance <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:28">[00:17:28]</a>.

## Investment Tailwinds

Caterpillar benefits from significant tailwinds across its three primary markets:
*   **Construction** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:49">[00:09:49]</a>: There is an investment deficit in housing construction <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:35">[00:09:35]</a>.
*   **Mining** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:54">[00:09:54]</a>: Dump trucks and excavators are heavily used in mining <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:55">[00:09:55]</a>. The mining sector is experiencing positive trends due to inflation and rising raw material prices <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:30">[00:10:30]</a>. Miners are investing more in equipment during this favorable cycle <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:51">[00:10:51]</a>. Future demand for metals like aluminum, copper, and gold is expected to lead to shortages if investment doesn't increase, which would drive prices up and encourage mining companies to acquire more equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:58">[00:14:58]</a>.
*   **Public Works and Infrastructure** <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:09:59">[00:09:59]</a>: This includes bridges, airports, and other infrastructure projects <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:02">[00:10:02]</a>. Both Biden and potentially Trump have expressed intentions to heavily invest in modernizing the entire U.S. infrastructure, which is currently in a "deplorable state," especially roads <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:07">[00:10:07]</a>. U.S. infrastructure spending has been increasing in recent years and is projected to continue rising in 2024 and 2025, which necessitates Caterpillar's equipment <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:41">[00:14:41]</a>.

## Oil and Gas Sector
Caterpillar is a primary supplier of machinery for the oil and gas producing companies, particularly for work in areas where wells are established <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:39">[00:16:39]</a>. This includes preparing land, building infrastructure for access, roads, and pipelines <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:48">[00:16:48]</a>. Despite news, oil remains necessary for many emerging markets and Asian countries <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:16">[00:16:16]</a>. A significant lack of investment in oil and gas exploration occurred in previous years (2016, 2020-2021), but spending on exploration and production is expected to increase dramatically by 2025 and 2030 to meet demand <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:16:04">[00:16:04]</a>.

## Technological Advancement
Caterpillar invests heavily in technology to maintain its competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:20">[00:11:20]</a>. The company has significant financial strength to fund these technology investments <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:10">[00:07:10]</a>. Its annual spending on research and development approaches almost $2 billion to advance new technologies that will provide greater future competitive advantage <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:07:23">[00:07:23]</a>.

## Financial Performance and Shareholder Returns
Caterpillar is a cyclical business, meaning its performance fluctuates with economic cycles <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:10:06">[00:10:06]</a>. It has historically paid interesting dividends, similar to [[john_deere_and_agricultural_machinery_investment | John Deere]] <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:11:44">[00:11:44]</a>. The company is a "dividend king" or "dividend aristocrat," having paid dividends almost incessantly for 30 years and consistently trying to raise or maintain them <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:26">[00:13:26]</a>.

The company has seen substantial growth, with revenue increasing by 20% in 2021 and 16% in 2022, after a complicated period due to a downward cycle in oil and raw materials <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:12:17">[00:12:17]</a>. Profit margins have also improved, with forecasts for benefits to climb from $10-$12 to $18-$20 in the coming years <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:04">[00:13:04]</a>. Caterpillar also engages in share buybacks, which are seen as an increase in dividend per share because fewer shares are distributed <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:13:49">[00:13:49]</a>. In 2022, it recorded an all-time high of $4.2 billion in share buybacks, indicating the company believes its shares are cheap <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:14:15">[00:14:15]</a>.

Caterpillar expects sales to reach $72 billion (up from around $60 billion currently), with margins continuing to expand due to significant economies of scale <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:07">[00:17:07]</a>. This could lead to a scenario where sales grow by 10% but profits grow by 20%, potentially reaching 25% with share buybacks <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:17:45">[00:17:45]</a>.

## Valuation
Caterpillar is currently trading at approximately 13 times earnings, which is below its 5-year average of 18 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:23">[00:18:23]</a>. Historically, being a cyclical but strong business, Caterpillar has traded up to 30 times earnings <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:31">[00:18:31]</a>. Its current valuation is not far from its Covid lows of 11-12 times earnings, making it relatively cheaper as the company grows <a class="yt-timestamp" data-t="00:18:39">[00:18:39]</a>.
